the
opinion
recorded
by
the
kerala
high
court
in
itr
no
16
of
1997
has
given
rise
to
this
appeal
filed
by
the
chief
commissioner
of
income
tax
the
dispute
relates
to
the
assessment
year
1985
86
at
the
instance
of
the
revenue
the
following
question
was
referred
under
section
2561
of
the
income
tax
act
for
the
opinion
of
the
high
court
whether
on
the
facts
and
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
the
tribunal
is
right
in
law
and
fact
in
holding
that
rs
3
2
758
cannot
be
brought
to
tax
and
in
doleting
the
addition
of
rs
3
2
758
sustained
by
cit
appeals
the
high
court
accepted
the
view
of
the
tribunal
which
partly
allowed
the
appeal
of
the
assessee
and
answered
the
question
in
favour
of
the
assessee
2
the
facts
in
brief
are
the
respondent
assessee
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
tea
spices
etc
during
the
assessment
year
1985
86
previous
year
ending
on
3131985
the
assessee
wrote
back
in
its
accounts
a
sum
of
rs
14
65
997
representing
the
provision
made
during
earlier
years
1978
1981
towards
its
purchase
tax
liability
it
appears
that
the
liability
to
pay
purchase
tax
on
certain
goods
was
in
dispute
and
therefore
the
provision
was
made
further
it
appears
that
the
assessee
in
support
of
its
claim
for
purchase
tax
relief
inter
alia
relied
on
the
decision
of
the
kerala
high
court
in
neroth
oil
mills
case
the
slp
filed
by
the
kerala
state
against
the
decision
of
the
high
court
in
the
said
case
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
november
1984
apparently
for
that
reason
the
assessee
thought
it
fit
to
reverse
the
provision
made
earlier
towards
purchase
tax
and
therefore
made
the
entries
in
the
books
of
account
during
the
year
ending
on
3131985
the
assessing
officer
added
the
sum
of
rs
14
65
997
which
represents
the
provision
made
towards
purchase
tax
during
the
assessment
years
1978
79
1979
80
and
1980
81
treating
the
same
as
the
income
of
the
previous
year
ending
on
3131985
in
the
first
appeal
the
cit
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
justification
to
include
the
sums
which
were
already
included
in
the
course
of
reassessments
made
for
the
years
1979
80
and
1980
81
however
he
upheld
the
addition
of
rs
3
2
758
pertaining
to
the
assessment
year
1978
79
the
appellate
commissioner
held
that
the
liability
of
the
assessee
finally
ceased
during
the
year
1985
86
in
view
of
the
rejection
of
slp
in
neroth
oil
mills
case
in
november
1984
certain
observations
were
also
made
as
regards
the
inflexibility
of
the
sums
pertaining
to
assessment
years
1980
81
and
1981
82
in
respect
of
which
reassessments
were
made
however
in
this
appeal
we
need
not
go
into
the
details
thereof
3
on
further
appeal
by
the
assessee
the
tribunal
set
aside
the
addition
of
rs
3
2
758
which
was
upheld
by
the
appellate
commissioner
the
tribunal
did
not
agree
with
the
view
taken
by
the
first
appellate
authority
that
there
was
no
cessation
of
liability
within
the
meaning
of
section
411
of
the
income
tax
act
during
the
relevant
year
on
account
of
dismissal
of
slp
in
another
case
the
tribunal
observed
that
for
claiming
exemption
from
purchase
tax
on
the
ground
that
transaction
was
in
the
course
of
export
two
conditions
were
required
to
be
fulfilled
1
things
purchased
and
exported
are
one
and
the
same
and
2
the
purchases
were
against
firm
orders
for
export
neroth
oil
mills
case
was
concerned
only
with
the
first
aspect
and
not
the
second
aspect
therefore
the
tribunal
observed
that
the
judgment
in
neroth
oil
mills
case
even
if
it
had
attained
finality
does
not
put
an
end
to
the
disputed
issue
involved
in
the
respondent
assessee
s
case
the
tribunal
further
noticed
that
as
late
as
1993
the
sales
tax
department
was
pursuing
the
issue
relating
to
purchase
tax
liability
of
the
assessee
from
the
assessment
year
1974
75
onwards
and
the
cases
were
still
pending
decision
before
the
sales
tax
authorities
the
tribunal
pointed
out
that
he
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
the
assessee
in
writing
back
the
amounts
could
not
have
the
effect
of
extinguishing
the
statutory
liability
on
reference
the
high
court
approved
the
view
taken
by
the
tribunal
and
held
that
section
411
cannot
be
invoked
in
the
instant
case
hence
this
appeal
by
revenue
by
special
leave
4
it
may
be
noted
that
the
provision
was
made
in
the
books
of
account
towards
purchase
tax
which
was
under
dispute
and
the
benefit
of
deduction
from
business
income
was
availed
of
in
the
past
years
in
relation
thereto
the
same
was
sought
to
be
reversed
by
the
assessee
during
the
year
ending
on
3131985
for
whatever
reason
it
be
the
question
is
whether
the
circumstances
contemplated
by
section
411
exists
so
as
to
enable
the
revenue
to
take
back
what
has
been
allowed
earlier
as
business
expenditure
and
to
include
such
amount
in
the
income
of
the
relevant
assessment
year
ie
1985
86
in
order
to
apply
section
411
in
the
context
of
the
facts
obtaining
in
the
present
case
the
following
points
are
to
be
kept
in
view
1
in
the
course
of
assessment
for
an
earlier
year
allowance
or
deduction
has
been
made
in
respect
of
trading
liability
incurred
by
the
assessee
2
subsequently
a
benefit
is
obtained
in
respect
of
such
trading
liability
by
way
of
remission
or
cessation
thereof
during
the
year
in
which
such
event
occurred
3
in
that
situation
the
value
of
benefit
accruing
to
the
assessee
is
deemed
to
be
the
profit
and
gains
of
business
which
otherwise
would
not
be
his
income
and
4
such
value
of
benefit
is
made
chargeable
to
income
tax
as
the
income
of
the
previous
year
wherein
such
benefit
was
obtained
the
high
court
agreeing
with
the
tribunal
rightly
held
that
the
resort
to
section
411
could
arise
only
if
the
liability
of
the
assessee
can
be
said
to
have
ceased
finally
without
the
possibility
of
reviving
it
on
the
facts
found
by
the
tribunal
the
tribunal
as
well
as
the
high
court
were
well
justified
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
purchase
tax
liability
of
the
assessee
had
not
ceased
finally
during
the
year
in
question
despite
the
finality
attained
by
the
judgment
in
neroth
oil
mills
case
the
other
issues
having
bearing
on
the
exigibility
of
purchase
tax
still
remained
and
the
dispute
between
the
assessee
and
the
sales
tax
department
was
still
going
on
there
is
no
material
on
record
to
rebut
these
factual
observations
made
by
the
tribunal
nor
can
it
be
said
that
the
reasons
given
by
the
tribunal
are
irrelevant
5
the
learned
senior
counsel
appearing
for
the
income
tax
department
has
contended
that
the
assessee
itself
took
steps
to
write
off
the
liability
on
account
of
purchase
tax
by
making
necessary
adjustments
in
the
books
which
itself
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
liability
ceased
for
all
practical
purposes
and
therefore
the
addition
of
amount
of
rs
3
20
758
deeming
the
same
as
income
of
the
year
1985
86
under
section
411
is
well
justified
of
the
act
but
what
the
assessee
has
done
is
not
conclusive
as
observed
by
the
tribunal
an
unilateral
action
on
the
part
of
the
assessee
by
way
of
writing
off
the
liability
in
its
accounts
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
liability
ceased
in
the
eye
of
law
in
fact
this
is
the
view
taken
by
this
court

we
therefore
find
no
substance
in
the
contention
advanced
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
incidentally
we
may
mention
that
the
controversy
relates
to
the
period
anterior
to
the
