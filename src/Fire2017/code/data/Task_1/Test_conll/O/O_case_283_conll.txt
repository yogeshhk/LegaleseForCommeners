no RB O

this CD O
to NNS O
us DT O
sounds TO O
a PRP O
plausible VBZ O

prosecution NN O
has CC O
done NN O
nothing VBZ O
to VBN O
really NN O
counter TO O
this RB O
version VB O
the DT O

judge DT O
found NNS O
that NN O
this VBD O

unreliable NN O
as VBD O
the JJ O

to VBD O
put VBN O

the IN O
bill NN O
for DT O
the NN O
fuel IN O
which DT O
he NN O
went WDT O
to PRP O
fill VBD O
in TO O
the VB O

however DT O
we NN O
find RB O
this PRP O
reasoning VBP O
far DT O
from VBG O
the RB O
reality IN O
as DT O
it NN O
is IN O
well PRP O
known VBZ O
that RB O
not VBN O
to IN O
many RB O
people TO O
would JJ O
ask NNS O

when IN O

in PRP$ O
india NNS O
and IN O
the NN O
accused CC O
may DT O
not VBN O
have MD O
expected RB O

so TO O
18 VB O
with RB O
respect CD O
to IN O
the NN O
shifting TO O

the NN O

the TO O

of DT O
26 NN O
august IN O
2008 CD O
the JJ O
prosecution CD O
has DT O
relied NN O
on VBZ O
the VBN O
motive IN O
that DT O

hoping NN O
to VBD O
get VBG O

2 VB O
lakhs JJ O

shalinibai NN O
but IN O
as NN O
we CC O
have IN O
already PRP O
noted VBP O
above RB O
it VBN O
is IN O
logically PRP O
flawed VBZ O
since RB O
the VBN O
death IN O

shubhangi NN O
would IN O
not NNS O
make MD O
accused RB O
appellant VB O
a JJ O
rightful VB O
claimant DT O
of JJ O
that NN O
amount IN O
moreover DT O
this NN O
motive RB O
does DT O
not NN O
explain VBZ O
the RB O
murder VB O
of DT O
the NN O
two IN O

lack CD O
of NNS O
justified VBP O
motive IN O
would JJ O
adversely NN O
affect MD O
the RB O
case VB O
of DT O
the NN O
prosecution IN O
as DT O
the NN O
present IN O
case DT O
is JJ O
solely NN O
based VBZ O
on RB O
circumstantial VBN O
evidence IN O
19 JJ O
further NN O
we CD O
find JJ O
no PRP O
merit VBP O
in DT O
the NN O

s NN O
reasoning NN O
in VBD O
finding VBG O
the IN O
facts VBG O

the NN O
next IN O

incriminating NN O

the IN O

his VB O

normal NN O

as JJ O
he NN O
would IN O
have PRP O

late VB O

returning RB O

wadsa VBG O
further IN O
it NN O
was RBR O
but PRP O
natural VBD O
for CC O
the JJ O
accused IN O
to DT O
search VBN O

try VB O
to CC O
find VB O

his VB O

even PRP$ O
before NN O
he RB O

go PRP O

the VB O

we DT O

it RB O

unnatural PRP O

next DT O

also JJ O

two NN O

only VBZ O
allegation DT O

appellant DT O
