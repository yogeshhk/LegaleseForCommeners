The  competent  Officertook  proceedings  under the Evacuee  Interest	(Separation)Act, 1951, to separate the share of K in the property and asthe. claimants were not prepared to purchase the share of K,he auctioned the entire property under s.10 of the Act.	 Thepetitioners  contended that K was not an evacuee,  that	 theproperty  was not composite property, that  the	 proceedingsunder  the Act were void and that s. 10 of the Act was	voidas it contravened Arts. 31 and 19(i)(f) of the Constitution.The respondents urged that the interest of K in the propertyhad  automatically  vested  in the  Custodian  under  U.  P.Ordinance  1  of  1649 and this	 vesting  was  continued  byCentral Ordinance XII of 1949, by Central Ordinance XXVII of1949  and Central Act XXXI of 1950 and any legal  defect  inthe  vesting  was cured by Central Act 1 of 1960,  that	 theproperty was accordingly composite property and was properlyauctioned under the Separation Act.  The Petitioners repliedthat U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949 and Central92Ordinance  XII	of 1949, were void for want  of	 legislativecompetence and there could be no vesting in law under  theirprovisions which could be continued by subsequent Ordinancesand Acts.Held,  that  the  property was composite  property  and	 wasproperly  auctioned under the Separation Act.  As K  was  anevacuee	 under S. 2(C) of the U. P. Ordinance, her  propertyautomatically vested in the Custodian under s. 5 and it	 wascontinued under the Central Ordinance XII of 1949.  Even  ifthese  two Ordinances were bad for legislative	incompetencethe purported vesting thereunder was continued under CentralOrdinance  XXVII  of 1949 and thereafter under	Central	 ActXXXI of 195o and any legal defect in such vesting was  curedby Central Act 1 of 1960.Held,  further that s. 10(a) of the Separation Act  did	 notcontravene Arts. 31 and 19(i)(f) of the Constitution and wasnot void.  As the petitioners were not prepared to  purchasethe  share  of K, the Competent Officer	 acted	properly  inselling the property by public auction.JUDGMENT:ORIGINAL JURISDICTION :Petition No. 56 of 1958.Petition  under Article 32 of the Constitution of India	 forenforcement of Fundamental rights.A.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyKAPUR.	 J.-This is a petition by six persons under  article32 of the Constitution praying for a writ of certiorari	 forcalling the records in which certain orders were passed	 andfor  the  issue of a mandamus directing the  respondents  torestore	 the  property in dispute.  The	 following  pedigreetable will assist in understanding the case:-93		       Hingan MianMoharram Main				 Shukrullah(d.1945)	       Abul	   Bashir     Nasir   Nazir    Majid	       Razzaq	   Ahamad     Ahamad  AhamadKhuda Bux		       Noori Mian=Rehmat		       Bibi (d.1953)	  Azimunnisa	    Khatoon Bibi   Taghma Bibi (d)	 = Maqbool Ahamad   =Abdul Barkat		       Shamsun Nisa	    Khudaija BibiLutf	 Md. Ahamad   Aiysha  Qamar-un-Nisa  Tehzib-un-NisaAhamad		     Khatoon94The petitioners alleged that the properties in dispute	wereacquired  by  Noon Mian and after his death there  was	somelitigation  but	 as  a result of a  compromise	between	 themembers	 of the family the shares of  the  contestants	werefixed as follows:-(a)  Rehmat Bibi, Widow..0-1-6(b)  Taghma Bibi....0-1-5(c)  Khatoon Bibi...0-1-9(d)  Azimunnissa....0-1-9(e)  Shukrullah.....O-5-4(f)  Khuda Baksh....0-4-3On  August 28, 1942, Shakru-ullah created a  waqf-alal-auladin favour of his sons and nominated Abdul Razzaq as  Mutwali(Trustee).   Shakr-ullah  died in 1945.	 In the	 year  1947,Khatoon	 Bibi, one of the petitioners, went away to  Karachiand the ostensible reason stated by her :Is that she went tolook  after  the  ailing sister of her husband	who  was  inKarachi.On  November 22, 1949, a notice was issued to Khatoon  Bibi,her manager and servants declaring her to be an evacuee	 andcalling	 upon  her to surrender possession of  her  propertywhich  was  described  as  "  Bhatni  Noori  (Chini   Mills,zamindari  and	kashtkari land ". Her husband  Abdul  Barkatfiled  objections but it does not appear that any order	 waspassed	on  those  objections.	 On  April  17.	 1950,	 theAdministration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (XXXI of 1950),hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Act,  came	into  force.Another	 notice	 was issued to Khatoon Bibi  by	 the  DeputyCustodian  of Evacuee Property, Deoria, on July 5, 1950,  toshow cause why she should not be declared an evacuee and whyall  her property be not declared evacuee property.   It  isalleged	 that the notice did not contain any description  ofthe  property and was therefore ineffective.  This  fact  isdenied by the respondents.  In their affidavit it was statedthat  the  property was fully specified and  identified	 andthat  the  notice of July 5, 1950, was by  way	of  abundantcaution;  the  property of Khatoon Bibi had  become  evacueeproperty  and  had automatically vested in  the	 year  1949.Against this notice also Abdul951951,  these  objections were dismissed.  The order  was  asfollows:-"I  Objection  dismissed.   Admittedly Bibi  Khatoon  is  anevacuee.   The notice is hereby confirmed and  the  property(sufficiently  although	 not thoroughly)   described  in thenotice is hereby declared to be evacuee propertyNo  appeal  or revision was taken against  this	 order.	  OnJanuary	 8, 1953, a notice under s. 7 of the Act was  issuedagainst	 Bashir Ahmad and Nasir Ahmad and by an order  datedDecember  14, 1955, both of them were declared evacuees	 andtheir  interests  in the properties  were  declared  evacueeproperty.  This order by the Assistant Custodian  (Judicial)shows  that in the notice the properties were described	 andit  was	 held that both Bashir Ahmad and  Nasir	 Ahmad	wereevacuees  and  their interest in the  property	was  evacueeproperty  but as it was composite property the exact  shareswere  left  to be determined by the Competent  Officer.	  Anappeal	was taken by these two evacuees to the Custodian  ofEvacuee Property, U. P., but it has not yet been decided.Proceedings  were then taken by the Competent Officer  underEvacuee Interest (Separation) Act (64 of 1951),	 hereinaftercalled	the Separation Act.  Notices were issued under s.  6of the Separation Act on February 15, 1954, and the  personsto  whom notices were issued filed separate claims  claimingvarious	 shares in the property.  The Competent	 Officer  byhis  order  of March 20, 1956, declared the  shares  of	 thevarious evacuees and non-evacuees and also held that as	 theclaimants  were not prepared to purchase the shares  of	 theevacuees in the property in dispute the only mode  availablefor  partition was by a public auction.	 He gave  directionsas to how the property which was the subject matter of waqf-alal-aulad was to be separated.	 As regards the valuation ofthe property he referred to the valuation made by the Assis-tant Valuation Officer and Superintendent, Valuation Office,Khan  Market, New Delhi, the former at Rs. 7,41,300 for	 theconstruction  and  lands  and the latter  at  Rs.  14,15,000inclusive of machinery, lands96and  buildings and then tentatively fixed the  valuation  atRs.   14,15,000	 and  again  referred  the  matter  to	 theSuperintendent,	 Valuation Office for final  valuation.	  Heheld  Khatoon Bibi's share to be 0-2-3 and also	  determinedthe interest of Bashir Ahmad and Nasir Ahmad and ordered theentire	property to be sold by auction.	 Against this  orderan appeal was taken to the Appellate Officer.  On August 13,1956,  the property in dispute was sold to respondent No.  3for  Rs. 16,05,000.  Against this objections were  filed  bythe  petitioner	 Azimunnissa and Abdul Wahid but  they	weredismissed  by  the  Competent Officer on  October  1,  1956.Against	 this  order a revision was taken to  the  AppellateOfficer but both of them were dismissed on October 24, 1957.in  the	 meanwhile the petitioners, on September  27,  1956,filed  a  petition  under  Art. 226 in	the  High  Court  ofAllahabad  in  which  they  attacked  the  validity  of	 theproceedings  taken under the Act and also the order  of	 theCompetent Officer ordering sale.  Some of the points  raisedby  the	 petitioners were decided in their  favour  but	 thepetition  was  dismissed because the  petitioners  had	beenguilty	of  laches as they had slept over their	 rights	 forfive years and had applied to the High Court when no furthernotices	 could	be  issued under the Act and  as  no  properaction	was taken by the petitioners as regards the  variousorders	passed. against this judgment of the Allahabad	HighCourt  in Azimunnissa & Ors. v. Assistant Custodian (1)	 andagainst the order of the Appellate Officer, the	 petitionersapplied	 for  special  leave to this court  but	 both  thesepetitions were dismissed on February 10, 1958.The  petitioners have now come to this court under  Art.  32for  a	writ  of certiorari (1) to quash the  order  of	 theAssistant  Custodian, Deoria, dismissing the  objections  ofthe  petitioner Khatoon Bibi on March 7, 1951; (2) to  quashthe order of the Competent Officer dated March 20, 1956	 andof the Appellate Officer dated October 24, 1957 and (3)	 forquashing  the  sale proceedings ending in the  sale  of	 theproperty  dated	 March	13,  1956 and  (4)  for	 a  mandamusdirecting  the	respondents to restore the property  to	 thepetitioners.97Three  questions were raised on behalf of  the	petitioners:(1) that the property was not composite property within	 theSeparation Act; (2) the shares of Khatoon Bibi and of BashirAhmad  and  Nasir  Ahmad were not  validly  declared  to  beevacuee	 interest  under the various provisions of  law	 andtherefore the provisions of the Separation Act did not apply; (3) section 10(a)(iii) of the Separation Act in so far  asit  directed  the sale of non-evacuee  property	 contravenesarts.  19(1)(f)	 and  31  of  the.   Constitution  and	 wastherefore unconstitutional.The decision of the case mainly depends upon the decision asto  whether the property in dispute was composite  property.Under  s. 2(d) of the Separation Act composite property	 hasbeen defined:S.   2(d) " 66 composite property " means any property whichor any property in which an interest has been declared to beevacuee	 property or has vested in the Custodian  under	 theAdministration	of Evacuee Property Act 1950 (XXXI of  1950)and- (i) in	 which	the interest of the evacuee consists  of  anundivided  share in the property held by him as a  co-shareror partner of any other person, not being an evacuee."S.   2(e) " " evacuee interest " in relation to a  compositeproperty, means the right, title and interest of ail evacueein that property."Therefore  if  it is established that any  interest  in	 theproperty  has  been declared to be evacuee property  or	 hasvested in the Custodian under the Act then the whole will becomposite  property.  For the determination of the  questionwhether	 any portion of the property in dispute was  evacueeproperty it becomes necessary to refer to the provisions  ofthe  various  laws which were passed in	 regard	 to  evacueeproperty.   The property in dispute is situate in  what	 wasthe  United  Provinces	and the first  legislation  in	thatprovince   as  it  then	 was,  was  the	  United   ProvincesAdministration	of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949 (U.	  P.Ordinance No. 1 of 1949), which98was promulgated on June 24, 1949.  In this Ordinance evacueeand  evacuee  property	had the definition  which  has	beencontinued in the later Ordinances and Acts.  By s. 5 of thatOrdinance  all	evacuee	 property   situate  in	 the  UnitedProvinces  automatically  vested in the	 Custodian  and	 anyperson	in  possession	of such property was  deemed  to  beholding	 on behalf of the Custodian (s. 6(2)).	 As  KhatoonBibi was an evacuee under s. 2(c) of the U. P. Ordinance herproperty  automatically vested in the Custodian under s.  5.But   the  validity  of	 this  Ordinance  was	successfullychallenged by the petitioners in the Allahabad High Court inAzimunissa  v. Assistant Custodian (1).	 The ground for	 thechallenge  was that there was no entry in the lists  in	 theSeventh Schedule of the Constitution Act, 1935, dealing withevacuee property and there was no public notification by theGovernor  General as required by s. 104 of the	ConstitutionAct, 1935.  This Ordinance, i.e., U. P. Ordinance 1 of	1949expired on August 23, 1949.On  June  13,  1949, the Governor  General  promulgated	 theAdministration	of  Evacuee Property  (Chief  Commissioners'Provinces)  Ordinance XII of 1949 and it was extended to  U.P.  on	August	23, 1949, by Ordinance XX of  1949  after  aresolution was passed by the U. P. Legislature under s.	 103of  the Constitution Act.  Section 5 of the former  providesfor the vesting of property in the Custodian as follows:-S.   5(1) " Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance	 allevacuee	 property  situate in a Province shall vest  in	 theCustodian for that Province.(2)  Where,  immediately  before the  commencement  of	thisOrdinance any evacuee property. in a Province had vested  inany  person exercising the powers of a Custodian  under	 anycorresponding  law  in force in	 that  Province	 immediatelybefore such commencement, the evacuee property shall, on thecommencement of this Ordinance, be deemed to have vested  inthe   Custodian	 appointed  for	 the  Province	under	thisOrdinance ".Section 8 of Ordinance XX added s. 41 to Ordinance(1) A. I. R. 1957 All 561.99Thus  under  s.	 5  in spite of the  expiry  of	 the  U.  P.Ordinance  the property of Khatoon Bibi was deemed  to	havevested	in the Custodian under the provisions  of  OrdinanceXII of 1949.  But this Ordinance (XII of 1949 as amended  byOrdinance XX of 1949) suffered from the same  constitutionaldefect	as  the U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949.   On	 August	 25,1949,  item 31-B relating to " evacuees " was added  to	 theconcurrent list by the Government of India Act (Third Amend-ment)  Act of 1949 and thus this constitutional	 vacuum	 wasfilled	up.   On  October 18,  1949,  the  Governor  Generalpromulgated the Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance(XXVII	of  1949).   It	 repealed  Ordinance  XII  of  1949.Section	 7  of this Ordinance provided	for  declaration  ofevacuee property and s. 8 for vesting of evacuee property inthe Custodian.	The relevant portions of s. 7 are :-S.7 "Where the Custodian is of opinion that any property  isevacuee	 property within the meaning of this  Ordinance,  hemay, after causing notice thereof to be given in such manneras  may be prescribed to the persons interested,  and  afterholding such inquiry into the matter as the circumstances ofthe  case permit, pass an order declaring any such  propertyto be evacuee property"S.   8 " Any property declared to be evacuee property  undersection 7 shall vest in the Custodian.(2)  Where  immediately	 before	 the  commencement  of	thisOrdinance  any evacuee property in a Province had vested  inany  person exercising the powers of a Custodian  under	 anylaw  repealed  hereby, the evacuee property shall,  on	thecommencement  of the Ordinance, be deemed to have vested  inthe Custodian appointed or deemed to have been appointed forthe Province under this Ordinance, and shall continue to  sovest ".These provisions were materially different from that in	 theprevious Ordinances as there was no automatic vesting in theCustodian.Thus  any vesting under Ordinance XII of 1949 was deemed  tobe  under Ordinance XXVII of 1949 as if the latter had	beenin  force  on  the  date  of the  vesting.  By	s.4  of	 theAdministration of Evacuee100Property (Amendment) Ordinance IV of 1950, s. 8 of OrdinanceXXVII of 1949 was substituted by a revised section s. 8. Therelevant portion of this section provided:-S.   8(2) "Where immediately before the commencement of thisOrdinance, any property in a province bad vested as  evacueeproperty in any person exercising the powers of a  Custodianunder  any law repealed hereby, the property shall,  on	 thecommencement  of  this	Ordinance be deemed  to	 be  evacueeproperty  declared  as	such  within  the  meaning  of	thisOrdinance  and	shall  be  deemed  to  have  vested  in	 theCustodian appointed or deemed to have been appointed for theProvince  under	 this Ordinance, and shall  continue  to  sovest.Provided that where, at the commencement of this  Ordinance,there  is pending before the Custodian for any province	 anyclaim  preferred  to him in respect of	any  property  undersection	  8  of	 the  Administration  of  Evacuee   PropertyOrdinance,   1949  (XII	 of  1949),  or	 under	 any   othercorresponding  law  repealed hereby,  then,  notwithstandinganything contained in this Ordinance or in any other law forthe  time being in force such claim shall be disposed of  asif  the definitions of I evacuee property ' and I evacuee  'contained  in  section	2  of  this  Ordinance	had   becomeapplicable thereto."Under  this  provision	of the Ordinance the  effect  as  tovesting was that it was deemed to be under this Ordinance.On  April 18, 1950, the Administration of  Evacuee  PropertyAct, 1950 (XXXI of 1950), which has been referred to as	 theAct  was passed by Parliament.	It repealed Ordinance  XXVIIof  1949.  The definitions of evacuee and  evacuee  propertyare  the same as in Ordinance XXVII.  Section 7 of  the	 Actand  s.	 8  also  are in the  same  terms.   The  provisionsregarding vesting of evacuee property in the Custodian	werealso  same  as	in  the amended s.  8  of  Ordinance  XXVII.Section 58 deals with repeals and savings.Therefore  the	consequence  of s. 8(2)	 was  that  propertyvested under Ordinance XXVII was deemed to101be vested under the corresponding provision of the Act.On   February  27,  1960,  the	Act  was  amended   by	 theAdministration	of  Evacuee Property (Amendment)  Act  1  of1960.	Sub-section (2-A) was added to s. which was  in	 thefollowing terms:-(2-A) "Without prejudice to the generality of the provisionscontained  in sub-section (2) all property which  under	 anylaw  repealed  hereby  purports to have	 vested	 as  evacueeproperty in any person exercising the powers of Custodian inany  State  shall,  notwithstanding any	 defect	 in  or	 theinvalidity  of, such law or any judgment, decree,  order  ofany Court, be deemed for all purposes to have validly vestedin  that person, as if the provisions of such law  had	beenenacted	 by  Parliament	 and such property,  shall,  on	 thecommencement  of  this Act, be deemed to have  been  evacueeproperty declared as such within the meaning of this Act andaccordingly,  any  order made or other action taken  by	 theCustodian  or  any  other  authority  in  relation  to	suchproperty  shall be deemed to have been validly and  lawfullymade or taken ".The argument raised on behalf of the petitioner was that  U.P.  Ordinance 1 of 1949, Central Ordinance XII of  1949	 andCentral Ordinance XX of 1949 were invalid as the legislativecompetence  of the Governor and of the	Governor-General  inregard to evacuee and evacuee property matters was wanting ;and all that sub-s. (2-A) of s. 8 added by Act 1 of 1960 didwas to save any vesting which purported to have taken  placeunder  Ordinance  XXVII but it did not purport to  cure	 anyinvalidity  due to constitutional incompetence and that	 thelaw  made  without  constitutional authority  could  not  bevalidated.  Reference was made to Saghir Ahmad v. The  Stateof U. P. (1) where at page 728 the following statement	fromCooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol  , page 384(note) :-" A statute void for unconstitutionality is dead and  cannotbe vitalised by a subsequent amendment(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 707, 728.102of  the Constitution removing the  constitutional  objectionbut must be reenacted " was held to be sound law.Reference was also made to M.P. V. Sundararamier    & Co. v.The  State  of Andhra Pradesh(1) where a    distinction	 wasdrawn between the unconstitutionality due to incompetency ofthe    Legislature   and   disregard	of    constitutionalprohibitions.The respondents in reply contended that there was no  defectin  the notice issued to Khatoon Bibi and her  property	 wasproperly  and sufficiently described therein and that Act  1of  1960 validated the vesting and removed all	defects	 andinvalidity, if any, arising as a result of the	deficienciesin the various laws operating on her case.The  first notice to Khatoon Bibi was under Ordinance  XXVIIdated  November	 22, 1949, against which her  husband  AbdulBarkat	filed objections. but evidently no order was  passedon  it.	 The second notice which was given on July 5,  1950,sufficiently  specified the property.  Against	this  noticeobjections  were  again	 raised by  Abdul  Barkat  but	weredismissed  by the order dated March 7, 1951, and no  furtherappeal or revision or any other proceeding was taken againstthat  order and any defects and deficiencies whether of	 lawor  otherwise  cannot now be raised.   It  was	specificallystated	in  that order that the property  was  sufficiently,though	not  thoroughly,  described and	 that  property	 wasdeclared  to be evacuee property.  The appellants  contestedthe  correctness of the fact that the property was  properlydescribed and referred to the judgment of the Allahabad HighCourt in Azimunnissa v. Assistant Custodian(2) (p. 568, para10)  which  indicates that there was no description  of	 theproperty.   In the view that we are taking this	 controversyloses its vitality.The  second  plea taken by the respondents was that  by	 theinsertion  of  s.  8(2A)  in  the  Act	by  Act	 1  of	1960retroactive  effect was given to the provisions of  the	 Actand  the vesting of any evacuee property which purported  tohave been vested as evacuee property in (1) [1958] S.C.R. 1422, 1469.(2) A.I.R. 1957 All. 561.103the Custodian was validated notwithstanding any defect in orinvalidity  of such law and on the commencement of that	 Act(Act 1 of 1960) the property which purported to have  vestedin  the Custodian was deemed to have been  evacuee  propertydeclared  as,  such within the meaning of the  Act  and	 anyorder  made or action taken by the Custodian must be  deemedto have been validly made or taken.The  word " purport " has many shades of meaning.  It  meansfictitious, what appears on the face of the instrument;	 theapparent  and  not the legal import and	 therefore  any	 actwhich  purports to be done in exercise of a power is  to  bedeemed to be done within that power notwithstanding that thepower	is  not	 exercisable;  Dicker  v.  Angerstein	(1).Purporting  is therefore indicative of what appears  on	 theface of it or, is apparent even though in law it may not  beso.   This means that at the time when the Act purported  tovest  the property in dispute in the Custodian	even  thoughthe  power  was	 not  exercisable, s.  8(2-A)  by  giving  aretrospective effect to s. 8(2) of the Act makes the vestingas if it was vesting under s. 8(2) of the Act and  thereforethe attack on the ground of invalidity cannot be  sustained.By s. 5 of U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949 the property of KhatoonBibi who became an  evacuee' under s. 2(c) and her  property'  evacuee  property'  under  s.  2(d)	was  vested  in	 theCustodian of Evacuee Property of the province of U. P.	ThatOrdinance was allowed to lapse.	 By Central Ordinance XII of1949 as subsequently amended the vesting of evacuee propertywas deemed to be under that Ordinance, which in its turn wasrepealed under s. 55 of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 which was  avalid  piece of legislation.  By s. 8(2) of  that  Ordinancethe  vesting under the previous Ordinance was deemed  to  beunder  that Ordinance as if it was in force on the  date  ofthe  vesting.  Ordinance XXVII of 1949 was repealed  by	 theAct  which  contained provisions as to vesting in  s.  8(2),which was similarly worded as the corresponding provision ofthe Ordinance and therefore by a fiction of law the originalvesting was to be treated as(1)  (1876) 3 Ch.  D. 600, 603.104if  the Act was in force when the first vesting took  place.The High Court of Allahabad in Azimunnissa'scase (1) held the vesting to be invalid because upto thetime of Ordinance XII of 1949 and even Ordinance XX of	1949legislative competence was lacking, and even by the  deemingprovisions in s. 8(2) of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 or Act XXXIof  1950  there was no valid vesting, because  the  originalvesting	 was bad.  We think it unnecessary to decide  as  towhether	 the deeming provision of s. 8(2) of the Act  or  ofOrdinance  XXVII of 1949 was sufficient to give validity  tothe vesting.  Section 8(2-A) as introduced into the Act,  inour  opinion,  makes  the vesting valid,  because  it  givesvalidity to the vesting which purported to have taken  placeas  a result of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 even though  it	 wasonly  apparently so and was not so in law, because  that  iswhat I purport' implies.The  effect  of	 s. 8(2-A) is that what	 purported  to	havevested under s. 8(2) of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 and which isto  be	deemed	to be vested under s. 8	 of  the  Act  whichrepealed  that Ordinance, notwithstanding any invalidity  inthe  original  vesting or any decree or order of  the  Courtshall be deemed to be evacuee property validly vested in theCustodian and any order made by the Custodian in relation tothe  property shall be deemed to be valid.  Thus  retrospec-tive  effect  is  given	 to the Act  to	 validate  (1)	whatpurports to be vested; (2) removes all defects or invalidityin  the	 vesting  or  fictional vesting	 under	s.  8(2)  ofOrdinance  XXVII  of  1949  or s. 8(2)	of  the	 Act whichrepealed the Ordinance; (3) makes the decrees and  judgmentsto  the	 contrary  of any court in  regard  to	the  vestingineffective; (4) makes the property evacuee property by	 itsdeeming	 effect; and (5) validates all orders passed by	 theCustodian  in  regard  to  the	property.   Because  of	 theretrospective  effect  given to the Act and  the  validatingeffect	of Act 1 of 1960 Saghir Ahmad's case (2) would	haveno  application.   In  the  view we  have  taken  the  otherquestion does not survive and the share of Khatoon Bibi mustbe held to be evacuee property validly(1) A.I.R. 1951 All. 561(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 707.105vested in the Custodian.  Therefore the property in  disputedoes  fall  within the definition of composite	property  asgiven in s. 2(d) and cannot be held to be invalid.It  was	 then argued that by the sale of the  property	non-evacuees  had been illegally deprived of their property	 andtherefore s. 10, cl. (a) contravenes the provisions of Arts.31 and 19(1)(f).  This contention is equally  unsubstantial.The relevant provision of s. 10 is as follows:--"Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary in	any  law  orcontract  or any decree or order of a Civil Court  or  otherauthority,  the competent officer may, subject to any  rulesthat  may be made in this behalf, take all such measures  ashe may consider necessary for the purpose of separating	 theinterests of the evacuees from those of the claimants in anycomposite property, and in particular may,-(a)  in the case of any claim of a co-sharer or partner,-(i)  direct the Custodian to pay to the claimant the  amountof  money assessed in respect of his share in the  compositeproperty  or  deposit  the  same in  a	Civil  Court  havingjurisdiction  over such property and deliver  possession  ofthe property to the Custodian and the claimant may  withdrawthe amount in deposit in the Civil Court; or(ii) transfer the property to the claimant on payment by himof  the amount of money assessed in respect of the share  ofthe evacuee in the property ; or(iii)  sell the property  and distribute the  sale  proceedsthereof between the Custodian and the claimant in proportionto  the	 share	of the evacuee and of the  claimant  in	 theproperty ; or(iv) partition	the  property  according to  shares  of	 theevacuee	 and  the  claimant and deliver	 possession  of	 theshares	allotted  to  the evacuee and the  claimant  to	 theCustodian and the claimant respectively."Thus  the  alternatives open to the Competent  Officer	werefour: of these (1) the payment by the Custodian of the moneyvalue of the share of the non-evacuees14106to the non-evacuees; and (2) the payment to the Custodian bythe  non-evacuees  of the money value of the  share  of	 theevacuees were not available to him.  The former in this casewas  neither claimed nor could the Custodian be expected  topay  such  a large sum of money to  the	 non-evacuees.	 Theorder of the Competent Officer of March 20, 1956, shows thatthe  nonevacuee co-sharers were not prepared to pay  to	 theCustodian the money value of the shares of the evacuees.  ofthe  remaining	alternatives the third alternative  was	 thepartitioning of the property but that also was not  possiblein  the present case because of the nature of the  compositeproperty  which comprised of a sugar mill which in the	verynature of things could not be partitioned.  Consequently theonly available mode of separation was the one adopted by theCustodian'.  i.e., by sale of the property and	division  ofthe  sale proceeds.  In the circumstances the action of	 theCompetent  Officer  could  not	be  termed  unreasonable  orviolative  of  Art.  19(1)(f) nor does it  violate  Art.  31because	 it  cannot be said to be deprivation  of  the	non-evacuees of their property without the authority of law.In  the	 result this petition fails and	 is  dismissed	withcosts.Petition dismissed.
