The wages ofclerks were, however, settled by a subsequent agreement bet-ween the Ahmedabad Mill Owners' Association and the Textile221Labour	Association.  Clauses 2 and 5 of the said  agreementwere as follows,-"   2.	That this agreement shall apply to  all	 the  Clerksemployed  in the local mills, i. e., persons doing  clericalwork, that is those who do routine work of writing,  copyingor  making calculations and shall also	include	 compoundersand  assistant	compounders who are qualified  and  who	 areemployed in the local mills.5.   A separate scale for those of the employees who  occupythe  position  lower than that of a full fledged  Clerk	 buthigher than that of an operative will be provided as under:-Rs. 40-3-70-EB-4-90-5-105This  scale  will be applicable in case	 of  ticket-checker,coupons-seller,	 tally-boy,  scale-boy,	 production-checker,third	counter,  cloth	 measurer  or  yard-counter,   fine-reporter,  cloth/ yarn-examiner, department store man,	cut-looker and those others who have not been included above butwho can properly fall under the above category."The  respondents  moved	 the Authority under s.	 16  of	 thePayment of Wages Act, 1936 (4 of 1936), for an order againstthe  appellant	for payment of. their delayed  wages.	Theyclaimed	 to be semi-clerks, lower than	full-fledged  clerksbut higher than operatives, and as such governed by cl. 5 ofthe  agreement.	  The Authority held against  them  and	 theappellate Authority affirmed its decision holding that Cl. 2Of  the agreement determined the applicability of cl. 5	 andsince  the respondents did not come within Cl. 2 they  couldnot maintain their claim under cl. 5. The High Court, on  anapplication under Art. 226 and Art. 227 of the Constitution,took  a	 contrary  view	 and set aside	the  orders  of	 theAuthorities  and  directed a rehearing.	 In this  Court	 theappellant  mills urged that (1) the High Court had  exceededits  jurisdiction under Arts. 226 and 227 in  setting  asidethe  order of the appellate Authority and (2) the  Authorityhad itself exceeded its jurisdiction under s. 15 of the	 Actin  entertaining  the applications of the  respondents	madeunder s. 16 of the Act.Held, that both the contentions must be negatived.The High Court has power under Art. 226 of the	Constitutionto  issue a writ of certiorari not only in cases of  illegalexercise  of jurisdiction but also to correct errors of	 lawapparent  on the face of the record, although not errors  offact  even  though  so apparent.   No  unfailing  test	can,however,  be  laid  down when an error of law  is  an  errorapparent on the face of the record and the rule that it mustbe  self-evident, requiring no elaborate examination of	 therecord, is a satisfactory practical test in a large majorityof cases.Rex v.

L.R. 892, considered.A look at the two clauses is enough to show that the  appel-late  Authority	 in  construing	 them  in  the	way  it	 didcommitted  an  obvious and manifest error of  law.   It	 wasclear	that  the  two	clauses	 applied  to  two   distinctcategories of persons and persons falling under cl. 5  couldnot  be governed by cl. 2 and were not expected	 to  satisfythe test prescribed by it.Under s. 15 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1936, the Authorityin  exercising its jurisdiction, made exclusive by S. 22  ofthe  Act,  has	necessarily to	consider  various  questionsincidental to the claims falling thereunder and, although itwould be inexpedient to lay down any hard and fast rule	 fordetermining  the  scope of such questions,  care  should  betaken not to unduly extend or curtail its jurisdiction.Whether a particular employee was an operative or one  abovethe  rank  of  an operative and below that  of	clerk  arid,therefore  within  cl. 5 of the agreement,  was	 a  questionintimately and integrally connected with wages as defined bythe  Act  and as such fell within the  jurisdiction  of	 theAuthority under s.  15 of the Act.There  could, therefore, be no substance in  the  contentionthat an employee falling within the category of those othersmentioned in the last part of cl. 5, to whom no	 designationwas attached, could not apply under s. 15 of the Act.A.

C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, G. P. Vyas andI. N. Shroff, for the appellantVithalbhai   Patel,  S.	 S.  Shukla,  C.  T.  Daru  and	  E.Udayarathnam, for the respondent No. 1.1960.  December 12.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyGAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-The principal question which this  appealby  special  leave raises for our decision  relates  to	 thenature	and  extent  of the jurisdiction  conferred  on	 theauthority by s. 15 of the223Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (Act 4 of 1936) (hereafter calledthe Act).  This question arises in this way.  The  appellantShri  Ambica Mills Co. Ltd., is a textile mill'	 working  atAhmedabad.    Three  of	 its  employees	 named	 Punamchand,Shamaldas  and	Vishnuprasad  made  an	application  to	 theauthority  under  s. 16 of the Act and prayed for  an  orderagainst	 the appellant to pay them their delayed wages.	  Inorder to appreciate the( contentions raised by the appellantdisputing  the	validity  of the respondents'  claim  it  isnecessary  to set out the background of the dispute in	somedetail.	 It appears that an award called the StandardisationAward  which  covered  the mill industry  in  Ahmedabad	 waspronounced by the Industrial Tribunal on April 21, 1948,  inIndustrial  Reference No. 18 of 1947.  This award fixed	 thewages  for  different categories of workers working  in	 thetextile	 mills at Ahmedabad, but left over the	question  ofclerks	for future decision.  Amongst the  operatives  whosewages were determined by the award the case of	hand-folderswas specifically argued before the Industrial Tribunal.	 TheLabour Association urged that the rate of Rs. 36-9-0 awardedto  them was too low and it was pointed out on their  behalfthat  they  did the same work as cut-lookers did  in  Bombaywhere  a head cut-looker was given Rs. 52 and a	 cut-lookerRs.  42-4-0.   On the other hand the mill  owners  contendedthat  the rate should have been fixed at Rs. 34-2-0  insteadof  Rs. 36-9-0.	 The Tribunal found it difficult  to  decidethe  point  because enough evidence had	 not  been  producedbefore	it to show the kind of work that  hand-folders	weredoing  at Ahmedabad; that is why the Tribunal was unable  toraise the wage of hand-folders to that of  out-lookers	inBombay.	  However, it made a significant direction  in	thatbehalf in these words: "At the same time", it was  observed,"we  desire to make it clear that if there are	persons	 whoare  doing  cut-looking as well as folding, they  should  bepaid  the rate earned by the out-lookers in  Bombay".	Thisquestion has been considered by the Tribunal in paragraph 16of its award.The  question  of  clerks, the decision of  which  had	beenadjourned by the Tribunal was later considered224by it and an award pronounced in that behalf.  However,	 thesaid  award was later terminated by the clerks in 1949,	 andthat led to an agreement between the Ahmedabad Mill  Owners'Association and the Textile Labour Association in the matterof  wages payable to clerks.  This agreement was reached  onJune  22,  1949.   Clauses 2 and 5  of	this  agreement	 arematerial  for the purpose of this appeal.  Let us  thereforeread the two clauses:	      "2. That this agreement shall apply to all the	      Clerks  employed	in the	local  mills,  i.e.,	      persons doing clerical work, that is those who	      do routine work of writing, copying or  making	      calculations    and   shall    also    include	      compounders and assistant compounders who	 are	      qualified	 and who are employed in  the  local	      mills.	      5.      A	 separate  scale for  those  of	 the	      employees	 who occupy the position lower	than	      that  of a full-fledged Clerk but higher	than	      that  of	an  operative will  be	provided  as	      under:-	      Rs. 40-3-70-EB-4-90-5-105.	      This  scale  will	 be applicable	in  case  of	      ticket-boy,  ticket-checker,   coupons-seller,	      talley-boy,   scale-boy,	 production-checker,	      thread-counter,	cloth-measurer	 or    yard-	      counter,	fine-reporter,	cloth/yarn-examiner,	      department  store	 man, cut-looker  and  those	      others  who have not been included  above	 but	      who   can	 properly  fall	 under	 the   above	      category."After this agreement was thus reached persons doing the workof cut-lookers began to feel that they were entitled to	 thebenefit	 of  cl. 5 and some claims were put  forth  on	thatbasis  against the employers.  Vishnuprasad  and  Punamchandapplied before the authority (Applications Nos. 39 and 40 of1954) and claimed delayed wages against the appellant on theground	that  they  were  entitled  to	higher	wages  underparagraph 16 of the award in Reference No. 18 of 1947.	Thisclaim  was resisted by the appellant.  The  appellant  urgedthat  the applications were not maintainable under the	Act,that they were barred in view of an arbitration award  whichwas then in operation and that on the merits the  applicantswere not doing225the  work  of  cut-looking.   All  these  contentions	wererejected by the authority.  It examined the duties performedby  the applicants, and it came to the conclusion that	boththe   applicants   were	 folders  doing	  cut-looking,	 andconsequently  they  were  entitled each to  Rs.	 42-4-0	 permonth; in other words, the authority came to the  conclusionthat  the  applicants  properly,  fell	under  the  categoryspecified in paragraph 16 of the award referred to above andas such they were entitled to recover the difference betweenRs. 36-9-0 per month which was paid to each one of them	 andRs. 42-4-0 which was due to each one of them.  This decisionwas announced on September 2, 1954.On  July  11,  1955,  the  present  respondents	 moved	 theauthority under s. 16 of the Act.  They urged that they weresemi-clerks  and  occupied a position lower than that  of  afull-fledged clerk and higher than that of an operative, andas  such  they were governed by cl. 5 of the  agreement	 andwere  entitled	to increment provided by  the  said  clause.This claim was resisted by the appellant on several grounds.It  was urged that the present applications were  barred  byres  judicata,	that the authority had	no  jurisdiction  toentertain  the	applications,  and that on  the	 merits	 therespondents were not semi-clerks as contemplated by cl. 5 ofthe  agreement.	 On these contentions the  authority  raisedfour issues.  It held against the respondents and in  favourof the appellant on issues 1 and 2 which related to the pleaof res judicata and the status of the respondents.  In	viewof the said findings it thought it unnecessary to decide thetwo remaining issues which dealt with the quantum of  amountclaimed by the respondents.  It appears that the question ofjurisdiction, though urged in its pleading by the appellant,was  not raised as an issue and has not been  considered  bythe  authority.	  The finding of res judicata  was  recordedagainst Punamchand and Vishnuprasad.  Shamaldas had not madeany previous application and so no question of res  judicataarose	against	 his  application.   His   application	 wasdismissed  only	 on the ground that he could not  claim	 thestatus of a29226semi-clerk.   The same finding was recorded against the	 twoother respondents.  It appears that at the trial before	 theauthority the parties filed a joint Pursis which  enumeratedthe  duties performed by the respondents in paragraphs 2  to7. The authority took the view that "the duties performed bythem  cannot be said to be the duties of persons  doing	 theroutine	 work of writing, copying and making  calculations".In the result it was held that the respondents were governedby  the	 Standardisation Award and did not  fall  under	 thesubsequent agreement.This  decision was challenged by the respondents before	 theDistrict  Judge	 who was the appellate authority  under	 theAct.  The appellate authority also was asked to consider thequestion   of  jurisdiction.   It  examined   the   relevantprovisions  of	the  Act and held  that	 the  authority	 hadjurisdiction to entertain the applications made before it bythe respondents.  On the question of res judicata it  agreedwith the finding of the authority, and held that the  claimsmade  by  Punamchand  and Vishnuprasad were  barred  by	 resjudicata.   Similarly, on the question of the status of	 therespondents it agreed that they were not semi clerks.  It isclear  from the judgment of the appellate authority that  indetermining  the  status of the respondents,  the  appellateauthority  applied  the	 same test as  was  invoked  by	 theauthority, and it considered the question as to whether	 theduties	performed  by the respondents were  similar  to	 theduties	performed by clerks.  It is obvious that  the  testsapplied	 are tests relevant to the employees  falling  undercl.  2	of the agreement, and since the application  of	 thesaid  tests led to the conclusion that the  respondents	 didnot fall under el. 2 the appellate authority held that el. 5was  inapplicable to them; in other words, the judgments  ofboth the authority and the appellate authority clearly	showthat they took the view that el. 2 was wholly  determinativeof the issue, and that unless an. employee fell under cl.  2he  cannot claim to be covered by any part of the  agreementincluding el. 5. That is why the appeals preferred by227the respondents were dismissed by the appellate authority onSeptember 2, 1954.These appellate decisions were challenged by the respondentsby  filing  a writ petition under Arts. 226 and 227  of	 theConstitution before the Bombay High Court.  The Bombay	HighCourt has held that the decision of the appellate  authoritywas  patently erroneous in law in that it proceeded  on	 theassumption that unless cl. 2 of the agreement was  satisfiedcl. 5 would be inapplicable.  It also held that the  findingconcurrently  recorded	by  the	 authorities  below  on	 thequestion of res judicata against two of the respondents	 wasmanifestly  erroneous.	 On these findings  the	 High  Courtallowed	 the  writ petition filed by  the  respondents,	 setaside the orders of the authorities below and sent the	caseback to the authority for dealing with it in accordance withlaw  in	 the  light of the judgment delivered  by  the	HighCourt.	 It is against this decision that the appellant	 haspreferred the present appeal by special leave.The first contention which the learned Attorney-General	 hasraised before us on behalf of the appellant is that the HighCourt has exceeded its jurisdiction under Arts. 226 and	 227in interfering with the decision of the appellate authority.He 'contends that at the highest the error committed by	 theappellate  authority  is one of law but it is not  an  errorapparent  on the face of the record, and he argues  that  itwas  not within the competence of the High Court to  sit  inappeal	over  the judgment of the  appellate  authority	 andexamine meticulously the correctness or the propriety of theconclusions reached by it.The question about the nature and extent of the jurisdictionof  the	 High Courts in issuing a writ of  certiorari  underArt. 226 has been the subject-matter of several decisions ofthis  Court.  It is now well settled that the said writ	 canbe  issued  not	 only  in  case,%  of  illegal	exercise  ofjurisdiction  but also to correct errors of law apparent  onthe  face  of  the record.  In this  connection	 it  may  bepertinent  to  refer to the observations  made	by  Denning,L.J., in Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal  TribunalThe(1)  [1952] 1 K.B. 338.228writ  has been supposed to be confined to the correction  ofexcess of jurisdiction", observed Lord Justice Denning, "andnot  to	 extend	 to the correction of  errors  of  law;	 andseveral	 judges	 have  said as much.   But  the	 Lord  ChiefJustice has, in the present case, restored certiorari to itsrightful  position and shown that it can be used to  correcterrors	of law which appear on the face of the	record	eventhough	they do not go to jurisdiction".  There is no  doubtthat it is only errors of law which are apparent on the faceof  the	 record that can be corrected, and errors  of  fact,though	they  may  be apparent on the face  of	the  record,cannot	be  corrected  [Vide:  Nagendra	 Nath  Bora  v.	 TheCommissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam (1)].	  Itis  unnecessary	 for us to consider in	the  present  appealwhether or not a certiorari can issue to correct an error offact on the ground that the impugned finding of fact is	 notsupported by any legal evidence.  Thus it would be seen thatthe  true  legal  position in regard to the  extent  of	 theCourt's	 jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari  can  bestated without much difficulty.	 Difficulty, however, ariseswhen it is attempted to lay down tests for determining	whenan  error of law can be said to be an error apparent on	 theface  of the record.  Sometimes it is said that it  is	onlyerrors	which  are self-evident, that is to say,  which	 areevident without any elaborate examination of the merits thatcan be corrected, and not those which can be discovered onlyafter an elaborate argument.  In a sense it would be correctto say that an error of law which can be corrected by a writof certiorari must be self-evident; that is what is meant bysaying	it is an error apparent on the face of	the  record,and from that point of view, the test that the error  shouldbe self-evident and should not need an elaborate examinationof  the	 record may be satisfactory as a working test  in  alarge  majority of cases; but,, as observed  by	 VenkataramaAyyar, J., in Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Syed Ahmad Ishaque,	 (2)"there	must  be cases in which even this test	might  breakdown  because  judicial opinions also differ, and  an  errorthat may be considered by one (1) [1958] S.C.R. 1240.(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104, 1123.229judge  as  self-evident	 might	not  be	 so  considered	  byanother".  Judicial experience, however, shows that,  thoughit  cannot be easy to lay down an unfailing test of  generalapplication  it is usually not difficult to  decide  whetherthe  impugned error of law is apparent. on the face  of	 therecord or not.What  then is the error apparent on the face of the(  recordwhich  the  High Court has corrected by issuing	 a  writ  ofcertiorari in the present case?	 According to the High Courtthe construction placed by the appellate authority on cls. 2and 5 of the agreement is patently and manifestly erroneous.The  appellate authority held on a construction of the	saidtwo  clauses  that cl. 2 was the determinative	clause,	 andthat  unless an employee satisfied the requirements  of	 thesaid  clause  he could not claim the benefit of	 cl.  5.  Indeciding whether the High Court should have issued the	writor not it is necessary to examine the said two clauses.	  Onlooking	 at  the  two  clauses	it  seems  to  us  that	 theconclusion  is inescapable that the error committed  by	 theappellate  authority  is  manifest and	obvious.   Clause  2applies	 to clerks employed in the local mills, and as	suchit describes the nature of the work which is required to  bedone by persons falling under that clause.  Clause 5, on theother  hand,  obviously provides for a	separate  scale	 forthose employees who are not clerks nor operatives; these em-ployees occupied a position higher than that of an operativeand below that of a full-fledged clerk.	 Therefore there  isno doubt that persons falling under cl. 5 cannot fall  underel.  2, and should not therefore be expected to satisfy	 thetest  prescribed by the said clause.  A bare perusal of	 thelist of employees specified by designation as falling  underel.  5 will show that the application of the test  which  isrelevant  under	 el.  2	 would	in  their  case	 be   whollyinappropriate  and irrelevant.	Therefore, in  our  opinion,the error committed by the appellate authority was of such amanifest  character  that the High Court  was  justified  incorrecting  the	 said  error  by the  issue  of	 a  writ  ofcertiorari.   The question involved in the decision  of	 thedispute is not so much of construction of the document as ofgiving effect to the plain terms of the230document.   If el. 5 expressly provides for employees  ,,notfalling	 under el. 2, and if that intention is clarified  bythe list of designations which fall under el. 5 and yet	 theappellate  authority reads that clause as subject to cl.  2,that must be regarded as an error patent on the face of	 therecord.	 It is not a case where two alternative	 conclusionsare  possible; it is a case of plain misreading of  the	 twoprovisions  ignoring altogether the very object	 with  whichthe  two  separate provisions were made.   In  our  opinion,therefore,  the contention raised by the  learned  Attorney-General that by issuing the writ the High Court has exceededits jurisdiction is not well-founded.That  takes  us to the second, and in  fact  the  principal,contention which has been seriously argued before us by	 thelearned	 Attorney-General.  He urged that  the	applicationsmade  by  the  respondents' Union on  behalf  of  the  threeemployees  were incompetent under s. 15 of the Act  and	 theauthority  exceeded its jurisdiction in	 entertaining  them.It is true that this point was not specifically urged beforethe authority, but it appears to have been argued before theappellate  authority  and  the High Court, and	it  is	thiscontention  which raises the problem of construing s. 15  ofthe   Act.   The  case	for  the  appellant  is	  that	 thejurisdiction  conferred	 on the authority under s. 15  is  alimited jurisdiction, and it would be unreasonable to extendit on any inferential ground or by implication.The  scheme  of the Act is clear.  The Act was	intended  toregulate the payment of wages to certain classes of  personsemployed  in  industry, and its object is to provide  for  aspeedy	and effective remedy to the employees in respect  oftheir	claims	arising	 out.  of  illegal   deductions	  orunjustified  delay made in paying wages to them.  With	thatobject	s.  2(vi) of the Act has defined wages.	  Section  4fixes  the  wage period.  Section 5 prescribes the  time  ofpayment	 of  wages;  and  s.  7	 allows	 certain   specifieddeductions  to be made.	 Section 15 confers jurisdiction  onthe  authority appointed under the said section to hear	 anddecide	for  any  specified  area  claims  arising  out	  ofdeductions231from  wages,  or  delay	 in payment  of	 wages,	 of  personsemployed  or paid in that area.	 It is thus clear  that	 theonly  claims which can be entertained by the  authority	 areclaims arising out of deductions or delay made in payment of   wages.  The jurisdiction thus conferred on the  authorityto  deal with these two categories of claims  is  exclusive;for s. 22 of the Act provides that matters which lie  withinthe  jurisdiction'  of the authority are excluded  from	 thejurisdiction  of ordinary civil courts.	 Thus in  one  sensethe jurisdiction conferred on the authority is limited by s.15, and in another sense it is exclusive as prescribed by s.22.In  dealing with claims arising out of deductions  or  delaymade in payment of wages the authority inevitably would haveto  consider questions incidental to the said  matters.	  Indetermining  the  scope of these incidental  questions	caremust  be  taken	 to see that under  the	 guise	of  decidingincidental   matters   the  limited  jurisdiction   is	 notunreasonably or unduly extended.  Care must also be taken tosee  that  the scope of these incidental  questions  is	 notunduly	limited	 so  as	 to affect  or	impair	the  limitedjurisdiction conferred on the authority.  While	 consideringthe  question  as to what could be  reasonably	regarded  asincidental  questions  let us revert to	 the  definition  ofwages  prescribed  by s. 2(vi).	 Section 2(vi)	as  it	thenstood	provided,  inter  alia,	 that  'wages'	 means	 allremuneration  capable of being expressed in terms  of  moneywhich  would,  if the terms of the contract  of	 employment,express	 or implied, were fulfilled, be payable to a  personemployed  in  respect of his employment or of work  done  insuch  employment,  and	it  includes  any  bonus  or   otheradditional remuneration of the nature aforesaid which  wouldbe  so payable and any sum payable to such person by  reasonof the termination of his employment.  It also provided thatthe  word  "wages" did not include five	 kinds	of  paymentsspecified in clauses (a) to (e).  Now, if a claim is made byan  employee on the ground of alleged illegal  deduction  oralleged	 delay	in payment of wages several  relevant  factswould  fall to be considered.  Is the applicant an  employeeof the opponent?;232and  that refers to the subsistence of the relation  betweenthe  employer  and  the	 employee.   If	 the  said  fact  isadmitted,  then	 the next question would be:  what  are	 theterms of employment?  Is there any contract of employment inwriting or is the contract oral?  If that is not a point  ofdispute	 between the parties then it would be  necessary  toenquire	 what  are the terms of the admitted  contract.	  Insome  cases a question may arise whether the contract  whichwas  subsisting	 at one time had ceased to subsist  and	 therelationship of employer and employee had come to an end  atthe  relevant period.  In regard to an illegal	deduction  aquestion  may  arise whether the lock-out  declared  by	 theemployer  is  legal or illegal.	 In regard to  contracts  ofservice some times parties may be at variance and may set uprival  contracts, and in such a case it may be necessary  toenquire	 which	contract was in existence  at  the  relevanttime.	Some  of  these	 questions have	 in  fact  been	 thesubject-matter of judicial decisions. (Vide: A. R. Sarin  v.B. C. Patil (1), Vishwanath Tukaram v. The General  Manager,Central	 Railway, V. T. Bombay (2); and Maharaja  Sri  UmaidMills, Ltd. v. Collector of Pali (5)); but we do not proposeto consider these possible questions in the present  appeal,because, in our opinion, it would be inexpedient to lay downany  hard  and	fast or general rule which  would  afford  adetermining test to demarcate the field of incidental  factswhich  can be legitimately considered by the  authority	 andthose which cannot be so considered.  We propose to  confineour decision to the facts in the present case.What are the facts in the present case?	 The relationship ofemployer  and  employee is not in dispute.  It	is  admittedthat the three workmen are employed by the appellant, and dothe  work of bleach-folders.  These folders  are  classifiedinto  Uttarnars and Chadhavnars.  Indeed, the items of	workassigned  to these categories of folders are admitted.	 Theappellant contends that the employment of the three  workmenis governed by the Award which is in operation,(1) (1951) 53 Bom.  L.R. 674.  (2) [1957] Bom.L.R. 892.(3) [1960] 11 L.L.J. 364.233whereas the respondent Union contends that they are governedby  cl. 5 of the subsequent agreement.	It is common  groundthat  both the Award and the agreement are in  operation  inrespect	 of  the persons governed respectively by  them,  sothat  it is not disputed by the appellant that	the  personswho are specified by their designation under cl. 5 would  beentitled to, the benefit of the said clause and would not begoverned  by  the Award.  If an employee is called  a  cut--looker	by any mill he would naturally fall under cl. 5;  inother words, all the specified categories of employees namedby  designation in that clause would not be governed by	 theAward  though at one stage they were treated  as  operativesbut they would be governed by cl. 5 of the agreement; and ifa person bearing that designation applied under s. 15 of theAct  his  application would be competent.   The	 appellant'sargument,  however,  is	 that when the last part  of  el.  5refers to other employees "who have not been included  abovebut  who  can  properly fall under the	above  category"  nodesignation is attached to that class, and in such a case itwould be necessary to enquire whether a particular  employeecan  properly fall under the said category, and that, it  isurged, means that such an employee cannot apply under s.  15but  must  go  to the industrial court	under  the  ordinaryindustrial  law.  Thus the controversy between	the  partieslies  within a very narrow compass.  An employee  designatedas a cut-looker can apply under s. 15 and obtain relief fromthe  authority;	 an employee not so designated	but  fallingunder  the said category by virtue of the work	assigned  tohim,  it  is  said, cannot apply under	s.  15	because	 theauthority  cannot deal with the question as to	whether	 thesaid employee properly falls under the said category or not.In our opinion, on these facts, the question as to whether aparticular employee is an operative falling under the  Awardor one who is above an operative and below the clerk fallingunder  cl.  5  is  a question which  is	 so  intimately	 andintegrally  connected with the problem of wages	 as  definedunder s. 2(vi) that it would be unreasonable30234to  exclude  the  decision  of	such  a	 question  from	 thejurisdiction of the authority under s. 15.  If a contract ofemployment  is	admitted and there is a	 dispute  about	 theconstruction of its terms, that obviously falls within s. 15of  the	 Act.	If that is so, what  is	 the  difference  inprinciple where a contract is admitted, its terms are not indispute,  and the only point in dispute is which of the	 twosubsisting  contracts applies to the particular employee  inquestion.   If the appellant's argument were to	 prevail  itwould  lead  to this anomalous position that  if  a  generalcontract  of  employment provides for payment  of  wages  todifferent  categories  of employees and describes  the	saidcategories  by reference to the duties discharged  by  them,none  of the employees can ever avail himself of the  speedyremedy	provided by s. 15 of the Act.  In such a case  everytime  a	 dispute may arise about the duties  assigned  to  aparticular employee before his wages are determined.  In ouropinion,  to  place  such an artificial	 limitation  on	 thelimits of the jurisdiction conferred on the authority by  s.15  is wholly unreasonable.  That is the view taken  by	 theHigh  Court  in	 the present case and we see  no  reason  todiffer from it.The  question  about  the nature and scope  of	the  limitedjurisdiction conferred on the authority under s. 15 has beenconsidered by this Court in the case of A. V. D'Costa v.  B.C.  Patel (1).	In that case the scheme of the Act has	beenexamined  by  Sinha, J., as he then was, who spoke  for	 themajority  view,	 and it has been held that "if	an  employeewere  to say that his wages were Rs. 100 per month which  heactually  received  as and when they fell due  but  that  hewould be entitled to higher wages if his claims to be placedon  the	 higher wages scheme had been recognised  and  giveneffect	to, that would not be a matter within the  ambit  ofthe   authority's  jurisdiction.   The	authority  has	 thejurisdiction  to  decide  what actually	 the  terms  of	 thecontract  between  the	parties were, that  is	to  say,  todetermine  the	actual	wages;	but  the  authority  has  nojurisdiction to determine the question of potential  wages".The Court took the view that the employee's(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1353.235complaint in that case fell within the latter  illustration.It  would thus be seen that according to this, decision	 theauthority  has jurisdiction to determine what the  terms  ofcontract  between the parties are, and if the terms  of	 thecontract  are, admitted and the only dispute is	 whether  ornot  a	particular  employee falls within  one	category  oranother,  that would be( incidental to the decision  of	 themain question as to what the terms of the contract are,	 andthat  precisely	 is the nature of the  dispute	between	 theparties in the present case.The learned Attorney-General has relied very strongly on thedecision of the Bombay High Court in Anthony Sabastin Almedav.  R. M. T. Taylor(1).	 In that case the employer  and	 theemployee  went	before the Court on the basis  of  differentcontracts  and	the Court held that it was  not	 within	 thejurisdiction  of  the authority to decide which of  the	 twocontracts held the field, which of them was subsisting,	 andunder  which of them the employer was liable to	 pay  wages.It would be clear from the facts in that case that two rivalcontract,%  were pleaded by the parties, according  to	whomonly  one contract was subsisting and not the other, and  sothe  question  for decision was which  contract	 was  reallysubsisting.  We do not propose to express any opinion on thecorrectness  of the view taken by the Bombay High  Court  onthis question.	All we are concerned to point out is that inthe  present appeal the dispute is substantially  different.Both contracts admittedly are subsisting.  The only point ofdispute is: do the three workmen fall within the category ofcut-lookers or do they not If they do then cl. 5 applies; ifthey do not the Award will come into operation.	 That  beingso, we do not see how the decision in Almeda's case (1)	 canreally assist the appellant.In this connection we may point out that it is common groundthat  in  Ahmedabad  textile mills do not have	a  class  ofemployees called cut-lookers as in Bombay.  The work of cut-looking	 along	with other kind of work is done	 by  bleach-folders and other(1)  (1956) Bom.  L.R. 899.236folders.   That was the finding made by the authority on  anearlier occasion when Punamchand and Vishnuprasad had  movedthe authority under s. 15 of the Act.  The learned Attorney-General has strenuously contended that it is unfair to	givethe same pay to the three workmen who are doing the work  ofcut-lookers   only  for	 a  part  of  the  time	  and	weresubstantially  doing  the  work	 of  bleach-folders;   that,however,  has  no  relevance  in  determining  the   presentdispute.  The only point which calls for decision is whetheror  not	 the work done by the three respondents	 takes	themwithin	the category of cut-lookers specified under  cl.  5,and  as we have already pointed out, on an earlier  occasionthe  authority	has  found in favour of	 two  of  the  threerespondents  when it held that they were folders doing	cut-looking.  If the said finding amounts to res judicata it  isin  favour of the two respondents and not in favour  of	 theappellant; that is why the learned Attorney-General did	 notseriously  dispute  the correctness of the decision  of	 theHigh Court on the question of res judicata.In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.		   ___________________
