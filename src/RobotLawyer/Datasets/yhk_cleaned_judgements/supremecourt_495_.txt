B. XXI Of 1949), s. 4(2),  Schedule-CriminalLaw  Amendment	Act, 1952 (XLVI of  1952)-Code	of  CriminalProcedure  (V of 1898), S. 529(e)-Indian Penal Code (XLV  of1860), ss. 116, 161 and 165A.HEADNOTE:On September 6, 1952, the appellant, who was being tried  byan  Assistant  Sessions Judge and a jury, was  caught  whilegiving	a  bribe to one of the jurors.	 By  a	notificationdated  November	 27, 1952, the Government  of  West  Bengal,acting	under  s.  4(2)	 Of the	 West  Bengal  Criminal	 LawAmendment  (Special  Courts) Act, 1949, entrusted  the	caseagainst the appellant under s. 161/116 Indian Penal Code  tothe Special judge, Burdwan, for trial.	Before this date  asa result of the introduction of s. 165A in the Indian  PenalCode by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952, providing	 forpunishment  for abetment of offences under ss. 161 and	165,abetment  of  s. 161 had ceased to be an  offence  under  s.161/116	 though it was an offence specified in the  Scheduleto  the West Bengal Act.  The records were received  by	 theSpecial	 judge on December 23, 1952, and he took  cognizanceof the case.  On February 10, 1954, a charge under s.  165-AIndian	Penal  Code was framed by the Special judge  and  onJuly 7, 1954, the appellant was convicted under s. 165-A andsentenced  to  rigorous	 imprisonment for  six	months.	  Anappeal	to  the High Court of Calcutta was  dismissed.	 Theappellant obtained special leave and appealed.Held, that the special judge had no jurisdiction to try	 andconvict	 the appellant for the offence under s. 165A  IndianPenal  Code as when the case was distributed to the  Specialjudge  s. 165A was not one of the offences specified in	 theSchedule  of  the  West	 Bengal Act.   The  case  which	 wasdistributed  to the Special judge was one under	 s.  161/116Indian Penal Code, an offence which was non-existent at thattime.  Section 165A cannot be deemed to have been  specifiedin  the	 Schedule merely because abetment  of  the  offencesunder  ss.  161,  162  163 and 165  Indian  Penal  Code	 wasspecifically  mentioned in the Schedule.  The offence  unders.  165A  is  a	 distinct  offence.   It  is  not  merely  arestatement  of	 the offence of abetment under s. 116  ;  itcomprises  also	 abetment under s. 109 and provides  for  inenhanced penalty.This defect of jurisdiction could not be cured by s.  529(e)of  the Code of Criminal Procedure.  Section 529(e)  appliedto1277Magistrates  and  would not apply to  Special  judges  whosejurisdiction  arose not on their taking cognizance under  s.190  of the Code but on the case for offences  specified  inthe  Schedule  being  distributed  to  them  by	 the   StateGovernment by a proper notification.JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 29  of1956.Appeal from the judgment and order dated August 24, 1955, ofthe Calcutta High Court, in Criminal Appeal No. 196 of 1954,arising out of the judgment and order dated June 7, 1954, ofthe  Court of the Judge, Special Court, Burdwan, in  SpecialCourt case No. 10 of 1952.S.   C. Issacs and S. N. Mukherjee, for the appellant.B.   Sen and P. K. Bose, for the respondent.1958.  September 11. The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyKAPUR  J.-This	is an appeal by leave of the High  Court  ofCalcutta  against  the	judgment and  order  of	 that  Courtdismissing  the	 appellant's  appeal against  the  order  ofconviction  by the Special Court of Burdwan for	 an  offenceunder  s. 165-A, Indian Penal Code and six months'  rigorousimprisonment.The facts leading to this appeal are that one Istipada Ghoshand  his son were being tried in the court of  an  AssistantSessions  Judge, Burdwan, with a jury of five.	 During	 thecourse	of  the trial the appellant approached	one  of	 thejurors	Baidya	Nath  Mukherjee	 and  offered  him   illegalgratification	as  an	inducement  for	 giving	 a   verdictfavourable  to	Ghoslies.  On the morning  of  September  6,1952,  the  juror  narrated these facts to  the	 police	 andthereupon  the	 officer in charge sent a  Sub-Inspector  toarrest	the  appellant	if he offered the  bribe.   After  alittle	while the appellant came to the appointed place	 andoffered Rs. 40 in four 10 rupee notes to the juror and whilehe  was trying to pass those notes to the juror	 the  PoliceOfficer	 arrested  the	appellant.   The  First	 InformationReport	for an offence under ss. 161/116, Indian Penal	Codewas made soon after.  And after investigation a report1278was  made  by the police officer in  charge  Burdwan  policestation which resulted in the case being sent to the SpecialJudge, Burdwan.	 On November 27, 1952, the Government issuedthe  following notification No. 6603J under s. 4(2)  of	 theWest  Bengal  Criminal Law Amendment (Special  Courts)	Act,1949 (W.  B. XXI of 1949):"  In exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (2)  ofsection	 4  of	the  West  -Bengal  Criminal  Law  Amendment(Special  Courts) Act, 1949 (West Bengal Act XXI  of  1949),the Governor is pleased to distribute to the Burdwan SpecialCourt constituted by notification No. 4632J, dated the	22ndAugust, 1952, under section 2 of the said Act the  followingcases  involving offences specified in the Schedule  to	 thesaid Act to be tried by the said Special Court:-(4)  The State versus Bhajhari Mondal, son of Bhuson ChandraMondal of Katwa Station Bazar Police Station Katwa, districtBurdwan tinder sections 161/116 of the Indian Penal Code.This notification shows that the offence charged against theappellant  was	one under ss. 161/116 of  the  Indian  PenalCode.The order sheet of the Special Court shows that the  recordsof  the case State v. B. C. Mondal under ss. 161/116  IndianPenal  Code were received by the Special Judge	on  December23, 1952, and the Special Court took cognizance of the case,the  appellant	was summoned for appearance on	January	 22,1953, and he did appear on that day.  On December 21,  1953,after several adjournments the hearing of the case was fixedfor  January  29,  1954, on which date	the  examination  ofwitnesses  commenced.  On February 10, 1954, a charge  unders. 165A, Indian Penal Code was framed by the Special  Judge.The  trial  ended  on June 7, 1954, and	 the  appellant	 wasconvicted  under  s.  165A  of the  Indian  Penal  Code	 andsentenced  to  six months' rigorous  imprisonment.   Againstthis order of conviction the appellant took an appeal to theHigh  Court of Calcutta which was dismissed.  It  held	thatthe appel-1279lant had rightly been convicted under s. 165,A and that	 theSpecial Court had jurisdiction to try the offence under thatsection	 from July 28, 1952, to May 9, 1953, under s.  7  ofthe  Central Act (XLVI of 1952) and from May 9, 1953,  underthe West Bengal Act (W.	 B. XV of 1953).  It also held	thatany defect in the   taking  of cognizance was curable  unders. 529 (e)     of the Criminal Procedure Code and that as  amatter	of fact the Special Judge took cognizance  under  s.165A  and  not	under ss. 161/116,  Indian  Penal  Code.  OnDecember 16, 1955, the High Court granted leave to appeal tothis Court.Counsel	 for the appellant has not contested the  appeal  onany  question of fact but has confined his arguments to	 thequestion  of  jurisdiction.  He contended that	the  SpecialJudge had no jurisdiction to try the case as (1) at the timehe took cognizance of the case, s. 165A, Indian Penal  Code,was not an offence specified in the Schedule of West  BengalAct  XXI  of 1949; (2) the case distributed to him  was	 oneunder ss. 161/116 an offence which no longer existed in	 theIndian	Penal  Code; (3) the Special  Judge  was  exercisingjurisdiction under the West Bengal Act (W.  B. XXI of  1949)and  not under the Central Act (XLVI of 1952) as no  SpecialJudges	were  appointed by the State Government	 under	thatAct;  (4)  the appellant could not be tried under  the	WestBengal Act XV of 1953 because there was no distribution of acase against him under s. 165A, Indian Penal Code.  In orderto decide these matters it is necessary to set out the dateson  which  the various statutes came into force and  to	 Seewhat  provisions  were	made therein.  On  March  11,  1947,Prevention of Corruption Act (Act 11 of 1947) was enacted bythe  Central  Legislature.   The  West	Bengal	 Legislatureenacted	 the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act of	1949(W.   B.  XXI  of 1949) which received	the  assent  of	 theGovernor-General  on June 23, 1949.  Its preamble shows	 theobjects	 of  the  Act  to be  more  speedy  trial  and	moreeffective  punishment of certain offences.  By s. 2 of	thisAct,  Special Courts were set up in West Bengal which  unders. 3 were to be presided over by Special1280Judges.	 Section 4 provided for allotment of cases for trialto  the	 various  Special Judges  and  also  authorised	 theProvincial Government to transfer any case from one  SpecialJudge	to  another  and  to  make  modifications   in	 thedescription of cases (whether in the name of the accused  orin  the charges preferred or in any other manner) as may  beconsidered necessary.  The Special Judge bad jurisdiction totry the cases for the time being allotted to him under s.  4(1)  in	 respect  of such of the charges  for  the  offencesspecified  in the Schedule as may be preferred	against	 theaccused.   All cases pending before any court or before	 anyother  Special	Judge were deemed to be transferred  to	 theSpecial Judge to whom they were allotted.  The Special Judgewhen  trying  a	 case allotted to him  could  also  try	 anyoffence whether specified in the Schedule or not with  whichan accused could be charged at the same trial.	By s. 5	 theSpecial	 Judge could take cognizance of a case	without	 thecase  being  committed and was to follow  the  procedure  ofwarrant cases and the court of the Special Judge was  deemedto  be	a court of Session trying without a jury.  By  s.  8rules of evidence were amended in certain particulars.	Sec-tion  9	 provided  for	enhanced  punishment.	By  S.	 theprovisions  of	the Prevention of Corruption Act  were	madeapplicable.  The schedule to the Act enumerates the offencestriable	 by  a Special Judge, the relevant  items  of  whichwere:(1)  "	An offence punishable under ss. 161, 162, 163 or  s.165 of the Indian Penal Code. ...........................................................(8)  Any  conspiracy to commit or any attempt to  commit  orany abetment of any of the offences specified in items 1  to7 ".On  July  28,  1952, the  Central  Legislature	enacted	 theCriminal  Law  Amendment Act (Act XLVI of 1952) by s.  3  ofwhich  an  offence  of abetment, s.  165A-with	an  enhancedpunishment was inserted.S.   165A.   "	Whoever abets any offence  punishable  undersection 161 or section 165, whether or not that1281offence	 is committed in consequence of the abetment,  shallbe  punished with imprisonment of either description  for  aterm  which may extend to three years, or with fine or	withboth ".By s. 6 the State Government were authorised by notificationto  appoint  Special  Judges for various areas	to  try	 thefollowing offences:(a)  " an offence punishable under section 161, section	  165or section 165A of the Indian Penal Code (Act XLV of   1860)or  subsection	(2)  of	 section  5  of	 the  Prevention  ofCorruption Act (II of 1947);(b)  any  conspiracy to commit or any attempt to  commit  orany  abetment  of any of the offences  specified  in  clause(a)..............."By  s.	7 exclusive jurisdiction was  conferred	 on  SpecialJudges.	  The effect of this enactment was the insertion  inthe  Penal  Code  of an offence 165A  and  the	creation  ofSpecial Judges to be appointed by the State.  On August	 12,1952,  the  Central  Legislature  passed  another  Act,	 thePrevention  of	Corruption  (Second Amendment)	Act  (59  of1952), s. 3 of which changes the rules of evidence in regardto  presumption and onus by adding sub-s. 2 to s. 4  of	 theprincipal Act by which it was provided:Where  in any trial of an offence punishable  under  section165A of the Indian Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) it is provedthat  any gratification (other than legal  remuneration)  orany valuable thing has been given or offered to be given  orattempted  to  be given by an accused person,  it  shall  bepresumed  unless  the  contrary is proved that	he  gave  oroffered	 to give or attempted to give that gratification  orthat  valuable	thing, as the case may be, as  a  motive  orreward	such  as is mentioned in section 161 of	 the  IndianPenal Code or, as the case may be, without consideration  orfor a consideration which he knows to be inadequate ".On  July 30, 1952, an Act, to amend the West Bengal Act	 XXIof  1949,  the West Bengal Criminal Law	 Amendment  (SpecialCourt Amending Act) (W.	 B. XII of 1952) received the assentof the President and came into force.  Section 3 of this Actsubstituted a news.   2 in place of s. 2 of the West Bengal Act (W.  B. XXI1282of  1949).   This substituted section authorised  the  StateGovernment  to	constitute  Special Courts  and	 to  appointSpecial	 Judges	 to  preside  over  such  courts  which	 hadjurisdiction throughout West Bengal.  By s. 5, the followingwas substituted in place of s. 4 of the West Bengal Act	 XXIof 1949:"  (1)	Notwithstanding anything contained in  the  Code  ofCriminal  Procedure,  1898 (Act V of 1898) or in  any  otherlaw, the offences specified in the Schedule shall be triableby Special Courts only:Provided that when trying any case, a Special Court may alsotry  any  offence other than an offence	 ,specified  in	 theSchedule,  with	 which	the accused may under  the  Code  ofCriminal Procedure, 1898, be charged at the same trial.(2)  The  distribution	amongst	 Special  Courts  of   casesinvolving offences specified in the Schedule, to be tried bythem shall be made by the State Government ".The  Schedule under the West Bengal Act (W.B. XXI  of  1949)was  also  amended by the insertion of s. 164  Indian  PenalCode  only.   The West Bengal Act XXI of  1949	was  furtheramended	 by the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment  (SpecialCourts)	 Amending Act, 1953 (Act XV of 1953).	It  receivedthe  assent of the President and came into force on  May  9,1953.  This Act added s. 165A, Indian Penal Code in item No.1 of the Schedule of the 1949 West Bengal Act.The  result of these various enactments, Central as well  asState  was  the creation of Special Courts to  try  offenceswhich were specified in the case of West Bengal (W.  B.	 XXIof  1949) in the Schedule and in the case of Central Act  inthe  body of the Act itself The West Bengal Act (W.  B.	 XXIof  1949)  created  Special Judges to  try  cases  involvingoffences  specified in the Schedule and allotted to them  bythe State Government alone.  Under the Central Act (XLVI  of1952)  also the State Government was authorised	 to  appointSpecial	 Judges and the offences specified in the  Act	weretriable by such Judges as stated in s. 7(2) of the Act.	 Theprocedure to be followed by the1283Special Judges was that prescribed for the trial of  warrantcases.	  Therefore  the  jurisdiction	of  Special   Judgesappointed  under this State enactment to try cases  relatingto  offences specified in the Schedule arose only when	theywere  allotted to them.	 By the West Bengal Amending Act  of1952 (W.  B. XII of 1952) in place of " Special Judges " thewords "Special Courts " were- substituted and two conditionsnecessary  for conferring jurisdiction on such Courts  were:(1)  cases to be tried related to offences specified in	 theSchedule  and  (2)  the State Government  had  to  make	 thedistribution  of such cases to the various  Special  Courts.Therefore  no Special Court had jurisdiction to try  a	caseunless it was for offences specified in the Schedule and theState Government distributed it to the Special Court.The  notification in the present case specified the name  ofthe accused, the offence for which he was to be tried as oneunder  s.  161/116,  Indian Penal Code,	 and  the  case	 wasdistributed to the Special Court, Burdwan for trial.  On thedate of the notification s. 161 and abetment of s. 161	wereoffences  specified in the Schedule but as a result  of	 theamendment   by the Criminal law Amendment Act 1952 (XLVL  of1952)  s. 165A had been inserted in the Code  providing	 forpunishment for abetment of offences mentioned in ss. 161  or165.   Section 165A created a distinct and separate  offenceand  therefore	abetment of an offence under s. 161  was  nolonger	an offence under s. 161/ 116 of the  Code.   Section165A was not included in the Schedule to the West Bengal Act(W.  B. XXI of 1949).  Counsel for the State contended	thatthis section although not specifically mentioned was all thetime specified in and must be deemed to have been  specifiedin the Schedule to the West Bengal Act (W.  B. XXI of  1949)because	 item 8 specifically mentioned abetment of  offencesin items I to 7 and that s. 165A only prescribes  punishmentfor abetment of offences under ss. 161 or 165 and cannot  becalled	a new or a different offence.  Section 165A  is	 notmerely a restatement of the offence of abetment under s. 116of the Code. It1631284also  comprises	 abetment  under  s. 109  of  the  Code	 andprovides  an  enhanced penalty of three	 years	imprisonmentinstead of 1/4th of three years imposeable under s. 116.  Itfurther	 attracts  the	application  of	 s.  4	(2)  of	 thePrevention  of Corruption Act (11 of 1947)  as	subsequentlyamended.   It cannot be, said therefore that merely  becausethe abetment of an offence under s. 161 was specified in theSchedule  of the West Bengal Act of 1949, s. 165A which	 didnot  then  exist in the Penal Code, must be deemed  to	havebeen  specified	 therein.  It is significant that  the	WestBengal Act was further amended on May 9, 1953, by Act XV  of1953 in order to include s. 165A in the Schedule.It  appears therefore that under the notification  the	casedistributed  to the Special Court for the appellant's  trialwas  for  a non-existing offence because  when	the  SpecialJudge took cognizance of the case there was no such  offenceas  ss. 161/116 of the Indian Penal Code.  The	notificationdid not mention s. 165A of the Code and at the time when theSpecial	 Judge	purported  to  take  cognizance	 he  had  nojurisdiction  to  do so and to try the case as	the  offenceunder  s.  165A was not in the Schedule of the	West  BengalAct, 1949, as amended in 1952.The  crucial  date  for	 the  purpose  of  determining	 thejurisdiction  of the Court would be the date when the  Courtreceived the record and took cognizance of the case and tookany step in aid of the progress of the case and not when theevidence  of the witnesses began to be recorded. Under s.  4of West Bengal Act (W.B. XXI of 1949) as amended by the	 Actof  1952  the  jurisdiction of the  Court  arises  when	 thenotification is issued distributing the case to a particularSpecial Court giving the name of the accused and  mentioningthe charge or charges against him which must be under one ofthe  offences specified in the Schedule.  In the absence  ofany  of	 these	elements the Special  Court  would  have  noJurisdiction.The High Court held." that the offence under section 165A was always triable  bya Special Judge only from 28th July, 1952, to 9th May, 1953,under section 7 of the Central Act1285and from 9th May, 1953, under the W. B. Act XV of 1953 ".As  already  stated the case which was	distributed  to	 theSpecial Judge was one under s. 161/116, Indian Penal Code anoffence not then existing in the Code and as s. 165A was notin the Schedule as an offence triable by a Special Judge  itcould  not  be held that the Special Judge  was	 trying	 theappellant for an offence under s. 165A.	 There is nothing toindicate  that	the appellant was being tried  upto  May  9,1953, under s. 7 of the Central Act.  No notification of theState Government appointing any Special Judge under s. 6  ofthe  Central  Act  (Act XLVI of 1952)  was  brought  to	 ournotice.	 It was on the other hand stated by counsel for	 theState  that  there was no such notification.  Nor  is  thereanything  to  show  that the Special Judge  of	Burdwan	 wastrying the appellants' case under s. 7 of that Act.  We	 areof the opinion that the trial was not under the Central Act,1952.	Nor could the trial be under the provisions of	WestBengal	Act  XV	 of  1953 because  no  distribution  of	 theappellants'  case  was	made  to  the  Special	Judge  by  anotification  mentioning  the charge against him to  be	 oneunder s. 165A, Indian Penal Code.  The High Court also said:"  It  is  true that if the offence under  section  165A  beregarded as a distinct offence, the Special Judge  appointedunder the W. B. Act had no jurisdiction in December 1952  totake cognizance of the offence and cognizance could be takenonly  by a Special Judge appointed under the  provisions  ofthe  Central Act.  But since in such case the Special  Judgemust be deemed to have acted erroneously in good faith,	 theprovisions of section 529(e) of the Criminal Procedure	Codewould	 apply	 and   the   proceedings   would   not	  bevitiated.........  It  is trial	 without  jurisdiction	thatvitiates  a  proceeding	 (section 530 Cr.  P.  C.)  and	 nottaking of cognizance in good faith without jurisdiction".But that with respect, is an erroneous application of s.   529of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides:1286"  If any Magistrate not empowered by law to do any  of	 thefollowing things, namely:(e)  to take cognizance of an offence under section 190,sub-section (1), clause (a) or clause (b);erroneously  in good faith does that thing, his	 proceedingsshall not be set aside merely on ground of his not being  soempowered.  "This section applies to Magistrates and would not apply to aSpecial	 Judge whose jurisdiction arises not on	 his  takingcognizance  under s. 190 of the Code of Criminal  Procedure,but  on	 the case for an offence specified in  the  Schedulebeing  distributed  to	him  by	 the  State  Government	  bynotification.	The defect of jurisdiction therefore  cannotbe  cured  by s. 529(e) of the Code of	Criminal  Procedure.The Special Judge war, consequently not a Court of competentjurisdiction  and the proceedings before him were  null	 andineffectual.We  are	 of the opinion, therefore, that when the  case	 wasdistributed  to the Special Court which is the basis of	 thejurisdiction  of  that	Court, s. 165A was not	one  of	 theoffences  specified  in the Schedule  and  consequently	 theappellant  could  not  be tried for and	 convicted  of	thatoffence.   The conviction is therefore by a Court which	 hadno  jurisdiction to try the case against the  appellant	 andthe whole proceedings in this case are null and void.We  would  accordingly allow the appeal and  set  aside	 theconviction of the appellant under s. 165A,I.   P. C., and the sentence imposed thereunder.Appeal allowed.1287
