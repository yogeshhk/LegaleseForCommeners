The question referred by the Tribunal to the	HighCourt was whether at the relevant time the assessee  companycould  be  deemed to be a company in which the	public	weresubstantially  interested,  i.e.,  held 25%  of	 the  votingpower, was answered in the negative.Held,  that the test that no holding by the Directors  of  acompany	 could be regarded as one in which the	public	weresubstantially interested was not the correct test to  apply.The  test as laid down in Raghuvanshi Mills v.	Commissionerof  Income-tax,	 [1961] 2 S.C.R. 978, would  apply  to	thisCase.Held, further, that the paramount condition in applying	 theproviso and the explanation of S. 23A(1) was that the publicshould	be  beneficially  interested in 25%  of	 the  votingpower., The explanation to S. 23A required that shares	heldby  the company should be considered as held by the  public,only if S. 23A did not apply to it.  The concession order incl.  14 of the; Part B States (Taxation	 Concession)  Order,1950, did not seek to negative that test, it only  conferreda benefit on a company,991to  which cl. 14 applied, and the company could	 avail	thatconcession,  and  still might fall within s. 23A  for  otherpurposes.The  Raghuvanshi Mills Ltd. v.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH,  J.-This appeal, on a certificate by the	HighCourt,	has been filed by Shree Changdeo Sugar Mills,  Ltd.,to  which  s.  23A  of the  Income-tax	Act  (prior  to	 itsamendment  by the Finance Act, 1955) was applied in  respectof  the	 assessment year, 1948-49.  The question  which	 wasreferred to the High Court was whether at the relevant	timethe  assessee  Company could be deemed-to be a	Company,  inwhich  the  public  were  substantially	 interested.	Thisquestion was answered in the negative by the High Court.During the assessment year, the Company had not	 distributeddividends to the extent of 60 per cent. of its profits,	 andan  order under s. 23A(1) of the Indian Income-tax  Act	 waspassed	by the Income-tax Officer.  The Company appealed  tothe  Appellate	Assistant Commissioner,	 who  dismissed	 theappeal.	   It  next  appealed  to  the	Tribunal,  but	 wasunsuccessful.	The  Tribunal, however, referred  the  abovequestion  which,  as  already stated, was  answered  in	 thenegative by the High Court.The  issued, subscribed and paid-up capital of the  assesseeCompany	 consisted of 60,000 shares, which were	 distributedas follows:992(1) 11 Directors of the Company	    41,500 shares.(2) The Managing Agency Firm		 2,300 shares.(3) Mysore Merchants Ltd.	   11,880 shares.(4) Others.....				 4,320 shares.				   --------------------					 60,000 shares.				     ------------------The  question arose in determining whether the	public	weresubstantially  interested  in the Company, that is  to	say,held  25  per cent. of the voting power.   The	Bombay	HighCourt  in  determining this point followed its	decision  inRaghuvanshi  Mills V.  Commissioner of Income-tax  (1),	 andheld that no holding by the Directors of a company could  beregarded  as  one  in which the	 public	 were  substantiallyinterested.  We have heard Civil Appeal No. 30 of 1957	fromthe  decision  of the Bombay High Court in  the	 RaghuvanshiMills case (1), in which judgment has been pronounced today,and  have held that that is not the correct test  to  apply.We  have  remanded the said appeal, after  setting  out	 thecorrect	 test  to apply.  What we have	said  there  appliesequally here.There  is yet another question, which arose in	this  appealbut not in the appeal of the Raghuvanshi Mills.	 As we	havealready stated, Mysore Merchants Ltd., held 11,880 shares ofthe  assessee Company.	If these shares could be said to  beheld by the public along with 4,320 shares, the public wouldbe  holding 25 per cent of the voting power, whether or	 notthe  Directors of the Company held the rest of	the  shares.It was., therefore, necessary for the High Court to considerwhether the shares held by Mysore Merchants 'Ltd., could  besaid to be held by the public.	The High Court held  againstthe assessee Company that they could not be counted as	partof the holding by the public, and, in our judgment, the HighCourt has reached the correct conclusion.The  matter has to be judged under the third proviso  to  s.23A(1), which read as follows:"Provided  further that this sub-section shall not apply  toany company in which the public are(1)  [1953] 24 I.T.R. 338.993substantially interested or to a subsidiary company of	sucha  company  if	the  whole of  the  share  capital  of	suchsubsidiary  company is held by the parent company or by	 thenominees thereof.Explanation.-For the purpose of this sub-section, a  companyshall  be  deemed to be a company in which  the	 public	 aresubstantially interested if shares of the company (not beingshares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend, whether with orwithout a further right to participate in profits)  carryingnot less than twenty-five per cent of the voting power	havebeen  allotted unconditionally to, or  acquired	 unconditio-nally  by,  and	 are  at  the  end  of	the  previous	yearbeneficially held by, the public (not including a company towhich the provisions of this sub-section apply), and if	 anysuch  shares have in the course of such previous  year	beenthe  subject  of dealings in any stock exchange	 in  BritishIndia  or are in fact freely transferable by the holders  toother members of the public."In applying the proviso and the Explanation, we have to giveeffect	to the words "not including a company to  which	 theprovisions of this sub-section apply", and have to determinewhether	 Mysore Merchants Ltd., is a Company, to  which	 theprovisions of s. 23A can be said to be applicable.   Learnedcounsel	 for the assessee Company contends that in  decidingthis,  we  have to be satisfied on three  points,  which  hesummarises as follows:(a)The	public should not be substantially  interested	inthat Company;(b)It  must  have  assessable  profits	for  the  relevantassessment year; and(c)It  must  not have distributed 60 per cent of  its  netassessable profits.He contends that unless these three conditions are fulfiled,s. 23A will not apply to Mysore Merchants Ltd., and that theshares	held by it will be deemed to be held by the  public.He points out that Mysore Merchants Ltd., had no  assessableincome in the corresponding assessment year and had suffereda  loss,  that conditions (b) and (c)  did  not,  therefore,apply, and994that  s.  23A  is not applicable to that  Company.   In	 ouropinion,  the  paramount  condition is that  even  in	thatCompany	 the public should be beneficially interested in  25per cent. of the voting power, and it was admitted before usthat  it  was  not a public Company at	all  but  a  privateCompany, and that, therefore, the public were not interestedin that Company.  The shares held by Mysore Merchants  Ltd.,cannot	at all be counted as a holding in which	 the  publicare  beneficially  interested,	in  view  of  the  exclusioncontained   in	the  Explanation.   This  point	 will	not,therefore, be open for the determination of the High  Court,when  the question is reconsidered by the High Court in	 thelight  of our observations in The Raghuvanshi Mills.Ltd.  v.Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (1), decided today.Learned counsel for the assessee Company also contended thatin   view  of  cl.  14	of  the	 Part  B  States   (TaxationConcessions) Order, 1950, the provisions of s. 23A could notbe  applied to Mysore Merchants Ltd.  That clause  reads  asfollows:"  14.	 Requiring  distribution  of  dividends	 by  privatecompanies.-The  provisions	 of  section 23A of the	 Act  shall  not  beapplied in respect of the profits and gains of any  previousyear  ending before the appointed day unless the  State	 lawcontained a provision corresponding thereto."This  Concession would be open to Mysore Merchants Ltd.,  ifit  satisfied  the terms of Cl. 14.  That,  however,  cannotdetract from the application of s. 23A to determine  whetherthe shares hold by it can be described as those in which thepublic are beneficially interested in another company.	 TheExplanation  requires  that  the shares held  by  a  companyshould	be considered as held by the public, only if s.	 23Adoes  not apply to it.	The Concessions Order does not	seekto  negative  this  test; it only confers  a  benefit  on  acompany,  to which cl. 14 applies.  Mysore  Merchants  Ltd.,may  be	 able to avail of that concession,  and	 still	fallwithin(1)  [1961] 2 S.C.R. 978.995s.   23A for other purposes.  This contention has no force.The  appeal  is allowed, and the case is remitted to  s	 theHigh  Court  for deciding the question in the light  of	 theobservations  in our decision in the Raghuvanshi Mills	case(1).   As  the case is remanded, the costs  of	this  appealshall  be paid by the respondent, but the costs in the	HighCourt will abide the result.					 Appeal allowed.
