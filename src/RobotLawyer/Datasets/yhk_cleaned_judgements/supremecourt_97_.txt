He was to be the trustee of the institutionsand  was  to  get 15% of the net income of  those  lands  astrustee's  remuneration.  Before the income-tax	 authoritiesthe  appellant	claimed	 that as the  income  received	fromagricultural  properties of the trust by him as trustee	 wasagricultural  income  in his hands and was by virtue  of  s.4(3)(viii)  of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, exempt	fromliability to pay tax, the remuneration which by the covenantcontained  in the deed of trust he received was also  exemptunder that section because, when he appropriated a  fractionof  the	 rent or revenue of agricultural lands	towards	 hisremuneration,  the original character of the income was	 notaltered.Held,  that the source of the right in which a	fraction  ofthe  net income of the trust was to be appropriated  by	 theappellant  as  his  remuneration was not  in  the  right  toreceive rent or revenue of agricultural lands, but rested inthe  covenant  in  the	deed  to  receive  remuneration	 formanagement  of	the trust, and the character of	 the  incomeappropriated  as  remuneration	was  not  the  same  as	 thecharacter  in  which  it was received by  the  appellant  astrustee.  Consequently, the remuneration not being  receivedas  rent  or revenue of agricultural lands  under  a  title,legal  or beneficial in the property from which	 the  incomewas  received,	it was not agricultural	 income	 within	 themeaning	 of s. 2(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922,	 andwas not exempt from taxation under s. 4(3)(viii) of the Act.Nawab  Habibulla  v.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySHAH  J.-The  appellant executed a deed	 of  trust  settlingcertain	 lands described in schedule " A " and the rents  oflands  described  in schedule " C " for the  maintenance  ofcertain	 temples and Thakoorbaries.  The material  terms  ofthe deed of trust are:cl. 6:-" And whereas the declarant feels that a	 Declarationof Trust should be made whereby the income of a part of	 theRaj properties may be earmarked and specially devoted to themaintenance  of	 the  aforesaid	 institutions  as  also	 theDeclarant  may as hitherto treat himself and be	 treated  byothers	as a legal Trustee of the said institutions and	 theproperties  out of the income of which the said	 maintenanceis being and will be provided for."cl. 7:-" The declarant declares that henceforth he holds andwill  hold  the properties detailed at the foot	 thereof  inSchedule   "  A	 "  in	trust  for  religious  purposes	  ofmaintaining the religious institutions more fully  describedin Schedule " B " annexed here-to. " cl. 8 : "The declarant further declares that in all  landsnow  held  by him in the aforesaid properties as  Bakast  orproprietor's  private lands as in the schedule " C  "  whichare  in	 direct	 khas cultivation  of  the  Declarant  shallhenceforth be or continue to be his tenancy lands for  whichthe  Declarant	shall pay the rental as noted  against	suchlands, annually to the " trustee for the use and benefit  ofthe  aforesaid institutions and the rights of the  Declarantin them76shall be those of a rayat under the Bihar Tenancy Act."The  net  income of all the lands set out in  Schedule	A'.'after providing for the expenses of management and the taxespayable	 thereon was estimated at  Rs. 1,81,717 and  the netrental	of  the properties described in Schedule " C  "	 wasestimated at Rs. 10,208 and from the aggregate of these	 twoamounts	 after deducting 15% as trustee's remuneration,	 thebalance	 of the income estimated at Rs. 1,63,136-4-0 was  tobe utilised for the objects of the trust.In  the	 assessee's  income  determined	 by  the  Income-TaxOfficer	 for  the assessment year 1950-51,  Rs.	 6,000	wereincluded  as income from non-agricultural properties of	 thetrust.	In the view of the Income-tax Officer, the trust wasnot  a, public religious trust and the income  derived	fromproperties  not	 used for agriculture was  not	exempt	fromliability  to  pay tax in the hands of	the  appellant.	  Inappeal	against	 the  order  of	 assessment,  the  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner held that the income coming  to	 thehands  of  the appellant from the trust properties  was	 nottaxable as private income of the appellant, but in his view,the  remuneration  amounting to Rs. 21,274 computed  at	 therate of 15% on the net income of the trust properties in theyear  in  question  not being  agricultural  income  in	 theappellant's hands was liable to be taxed.  In appeal to	 theIncome-tax Appellate Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna, the orderpassed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in so far  asit  related  to remuneration received by the  appellant	 wasaffirmed.  The High Court of Judicature at Patna  thereafterat  the	 instance of the appellant directed  the  Income-taxAppellate Tribunal to submit a statement of the case on fivequestions  set out in the order.  The fifth question  (whichis  the	 only  question	 material in  this  appeal)  was  asfollows:"  Whether, in the facts and the circumstances of the  case,the  amount  of	 Rs. 21,274 being the  amount  paid  to	 theassessee  in  his  character  of  a  Shebait  of  the  Trustproperties  should  have  been	held  to  be  exempted	fromtaxation on the ground that it is agricultural income ?"77The   High   Court  agreed  with  the  Tribunal	  that	 theremuneration was received by the appellant under a contract,and  it	 was  not agricultural income,	merely	because	 thesource of the money was agricultural income.  The High Courtaccordingly  answered  the  fifth  question  "	against	 theassessee".  This appeal is filed by the appellant with leaveunder s. 66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act granted by	 theHigh  Court  limited  to the  question	whether	 the  amountreceived  by  the appellant from the trust property  in	 hischaracter as a shebait was exempt from liability to payThe material part of the definition of " Agricultural income" in s. 2(1) is as follows:	      " Agricultural income " means	      (a)   any	 rent or revenue derived  from	land	      which is used for agricultural purposes and is	      either assessed to land revenue in the taxable	      territories   or	subject	 to  a	local	rate	      assessed	and  collected by  officers  of	 the	      Government as such.	      (b)................................................................Agricultural  income falling under cl. (a) ought  manifestlyto be received as rent or revenue derived from land used foragricultural	purposes.    The   income   received	fromagricultural  properties  of the trust by the  appellant  astrustee	 was indisputably agricultural income in  his  handsand it was by virtue of s. 4(3)(viii) exempt from  liabilityto  pay	 tax.  The appellant claims  that  the	remunerationwhich by the convenant contained in the deed of trust he hasreceived is also exempt under s. 4(3)(viii) because, when heappropriated   a  fraction  of	the  rent  or	revenue	  ofagricultural  lands towards his remuneration,  the  originalcharacter of the income was not altered.The appellant has no beneficial interest in the lands  whichare the subject-matter of the trust : nor is he given  underthe trust a right to receive and appropriate to himself	 theincome	of the properties or a part thereof in lieu  of	 anybeneficial interest in that income.  The source of the rightin which a fraction of the net income of the trust is to  beappropriated by the appellant as his remuneration is not  inthe right78to receive rent or revenue of agricultural lands, but  restsin  the	 covenant in the deed to  receive  remuneration	 formanagement   of	 the  trust.   The  income  of	 the   trustappropriated  by  the  appellant  as  remuneration  is	 notreceived  by him as rent or revenue of land; the  'Characterof the income appropriated as remuneration due is again	 notthe  same as the character in which it was received  by	 theappellant as trustee.  Both the source and character of	 theincome	are therefore altered when a part of the  income  ofthe   trust  is	 appropriated  by  the	appellant   as	 hisremuneration,	and   that  is	so,   notwithstanding	thatcomputation  of remuneration is made as a percentage of	 theincome,	 a  substantial part whereof is derived	 from  landsused for agricultural purposes.	 The remuneration not  beingreceived  as rent or revenue of agricultural lands  under  atitle,	legal or beneficial in the property from  which	 theincome is received, it' is not income exempt under s.  4(3)(viii).We may briefly refer to the authorities which illustrate themeaning of " agricultural income " in s. 2(1) of the Income-tax Act.In   Nawab  Habibulla.	v.  Commissioner  of   Income	Tax,Bengal(1),  the	 Privy Council held  that  the	remunerationreceived  by a mutwalli of a wakf estate, not  depending  onthe nature of the properties or assets which constitute	 thewakf  nor  on  the amount of income derived  from  the	wakfestate, is not agricultural income within the meaning of  s.2(1)  of  the Indian Income-tax Act even though	 the  incomederived	 by  the  wakf estate is from  properties  used	 foragricultural purposes.In Premier Construction Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of  IncomeTax, Bombay City (2), it was held by the Privy Council	thatincome received by an assessee not itself of a character  tofall  within the definition of agricultural income does	 notassume the character of agricultural income by reason of thesource	from which it is derived, or the method by which  itis calculated.	But if the income received falls within(1) (1943) L.R. 70 I.A. 14.(2) (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 246.79the  definition of agricultural income, it earns  exemption,in  whatever  character the assessee receives it.   In	thatcase,  the  remuneration payable to a managing	agent  of  acompany	 in consideration of services to be rendered  was  aminimum annual salary of Rs. 10,000 payable irrespective  ofwhether	 the  company made. any profit; but if	10%  of	 theprofits	 made by the company exceeded Rs. 10,000  the  agentwas  to	 get  an additional  remuneration  calculated  as  apercentage upon the profits of the company without regard tothe  source from which those profits were derived.   One  ofthe  sources  of  income of  the  company  was	agriculturalincome.	 It was held by the Privy Council that the  assesseereceived  no agricultural income as defined by the  Act:  hereceived remuneration under a contract for personal  servicecalculated on the amount of profits earned by the employer.In Commissioner of Income Tax, Bihar and Orissa v. KameshwarSingh(1),  income  received  by a mortgagee  who  went	intopossession  of	properties mortgaged to him was held  to  beagricultural income; but that was because under the deed  ofmortgage,  the	mortgagee  was to be in	 possession  of	 theproperties  and	 in his relation to the cultivators  of	 thesoil, he stood in the position of landlord dealing  directlywith  them and collecting the rents.  The mortgagee  had  topay  Government revenue, cesses and taxes and his  name	 wasregistered  in the Land Registration Department.   He  alonewas able to sue for rent whether current or arrears, to	 suefor  enhancement  or for ejectment and was  able  to  settlelands  with  raiyats and tenants in all the  properties,  infact, he was in a position to take all proceedings which themortgagor  would  have	been able to take  in  the  ordinarycourse if the lands leased and mortgaged had remained in themortgagor's possession.	 The mortgagee received the  income,because	 of  the  legal ownership vested in  him  and  eventhough	under  the  covenant of the mortgage  deed,  he	 wasrequired  to  appropriate the income towards his  dues,	 theincome in his hands did not cease to be agricultural income.In Kameshwar Singh's case (1), the court was called upon  toconsider(1) (1935) L.R. 62 I.A. 215.80the  nature of the primary receipt by the mortgagee and	 notof  the appropriation made under the coven. ant of the	deedof mortgage.In  K. B. Syed Mohammad Isa and another v.  Commissioner  ofIncome	Tax, Central and United Provinces (1), the  assesseewas  a mutwalli appointed under two deeds.  Under  both	 thedeeds,	he was to receive agricultural and  non-agriculturalincome	and to utilise the same for purposes of	 the  trust.Under one of. the two deeds of trust, the balance was to  beretained  by the mutwalli for his personal expenses  and  inthe  other  in	lieu of his services.  It was  held  by	 theAllahabad  High	 Court	that  the  residue  of	the  amountsretained by the mutwalli under both the deeds of trust	was,as  agricultural income, exempt from liability to  pay	tax.In  the view of the court, though the language used  in	 thetwo  deeds  of	trust was different, the  intention  of	 thesettler	 was the same: the mutwalli was required to  performthe functions of his office and so long as he did so, he wasentitled in consideration of this service to appropriate theresidue of the profits.	 But in each case, the mutwalli	 wasa  beneficiary with an obligation attached to his  enjoymentof  the	 benefit, and had therefore two capacities,  one  asmutwalli  and the other as beneficiary.	 The court on  thosefacts held that the balance of the income from the zamindariwent" through the mutwalli " to the beneficiary by virtue ofan  obligation	imposed under the terms of  the	 trust	deeditself	upon the income of the property'.  The mutwalli	 wasthe channel through which the beneficiary received the moneyand  the  beneficiary was to all intents  and  purposes	 thedirect	recipient of the income, and there was no change  ofsource and no alteration in the character of the income.  Itremained  agricultural income after it had passed  into	 thehands  of  the	beneficiary.   In  the	present	 case,	 theappellant has no beneficial interest in the trust  property.The  appellant	so far as his remuneration is  concerned  isagain not the direct recipient of the income of the(1) I,L.R. [1942] All. 425.81both altered when agricultural income is appropriated  underthe  covenant  in  the deed of	trust  as  remuneration	 forservices rendered.In this view, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.
