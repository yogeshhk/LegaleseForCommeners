Ltd., New Delhi	(hereinafterreferred to as the Tropical).  He was also a director of thePunjab	 Central  Bank.	  He  had  also	 floated   and	 wascontrolling a company called the Delhi Swadesi	Co-operativeStores	(hereinafter referred to as the Delhi  Stores).	  Hewas also a leader of the Forward Bloc in the year 1948.Accused	 No. 1, Kaul, is a barrister and was in Lahore	tillthe partition of the country.  In December, 1948, he was  inDelhi.Accused	 No. 2 Mehta, at all material times was the  managerof the Bombay Office (General) of the Tropical.Mahajan,  at  all material times was the  secretary  of	 theTropical.

He was also the managing director  ofthe  New Hindustan Bank.  He was for some time a  member  ofthe  All  India Congress Committee.  He was also  a  leadingmember of the Forward Bloc.The case for the prosecution is that Lala Shankarlal who wasthe brain behind the conspiracy and who at the time was	 themanaging director and had the control of the Tropical, whichby  then was financially in a tottering	 condition,  plannedalong  with  his confederates to obtain the control  of	 theJupiter,  which	 at  the  time	was  in	 a  sound  financialposition,  by acquiring the controlling block of  shares  ofthe  Jupiter and utilising the funds of the  Jupiter  itselffor the acquisition of such shares.By the date of the conspiracy the Jupiter had investments ofthe face value of Rs. two crores.  It had165issued	1,24,966 ordinary shares of Rs. 100 -each  of  whichRs.  15	 per  share  was called	 up.   It  had	also  issuedcumulative preference shares.  Rai Bahadur Girdharilal Bajaj(hereinafter  referred to as Bajaj) and Tulsiprasad  Khaitan(hereinafter referred to as Khaitan) were at the time, i.e.,in  1948,  in control of the Jupiter.  These  persons  ownedthrough the New Prahlad Mills Ltd. the controlling block  ofshares	of  the	 Jupiter i.e., about 63,000  shares  of	 theJupiter,  between  themselves  and  their  nominees.   Afternegotiations, conducted first through certain persons calledMayadas	 and  Chopra  and then, through	 one  Naurangrai,  abargain	 was settled with Khaitan for the purchase  of	thiscontrolling block of shares at Rs. 53 per share for a sum ofRs. 33,39,000.	Out of this amount a sum of Rs. 5,39,000 wasto  be paid over to Bajaj and Khaitan directly in  cash	 andonly  Rs.  28,00,000  would be shown as the  price  for	 thepurchase of the shares.	 The arrangement was that on receiptof  the cash of Rs. 5,39,000 the management of	the  Jupiterwas  to be handed over to Lala Shankarlal and his group	 andthat the balance of the money due of Rs. 28 lakhs was to  bepaid  over  to Khaitan on or before January  20,  1949.	  Indefault	 of  such payment within the prescribed	 time,	LalaShankarlal, representing the Tropical, should pay to Khaitana sum of Rs. 5 lakhs as damages for breach.  In pursuance ofthis  agreement Rs. 4,85,000 were paid over to Bajaj  on  orabout  December	 29,  1948, and	 a  formal  agreement  datedDecember 29, 1948, was entered into, incorporating the aboveterms.	 On  that  very day Bajaj  and	other  directors  ofKhaitan	 group	held  a meeting and  allotted  1,250  sharesstraightaway  to  Lala Shankarlal and four of  his  nomineesviz.,  Kaul, Mehta, Jhaveri and Doshi, each 250	 shares,  asqualifying shares for each.  They confirmed the transfer  ofthese  shares by a resolution and co-opted Lala	 Shankarlal,Kaul,  Mehta, Jhaveri and Doshi as directors and  themselvesresigned their respective offices as directors.	  ThereafterKhaitan	 resignned his position as managing director of	 theJupiter	 and  at  the  same  meeting,  Lala  Shankarlal	 wasappointed  in  his  place as the managing  director  of	 theJupiter.166The. transfer of 61,750 shares for the sum of Rs.  28,15,000to be paid to Bajaj and Khaitan before January 20, 1949, wasbrought about in the following way.  At the meeting of	someof the new directors of the Jupiter dated January 11,  1949,it was decided to sell the Jupiter's securities of the	facevalue  -of Rs. 15 lakhs at the market rate and to obtain  anoverdraft  accommodation  for Rs. 14 lakhs with	 the  PunjabNational Bank on the pledge of the Government securities  ofthe  Jupiter.  At the same meeting a loan of  Rs.  25,15,000purported  to  have been granted to Caveeshar by way  of  anequitable  mortgage on an alleged application by  him  datedJanuary	 4,  1949, relating to his properties at  Delhi	 so-Light  to  be given as security on the basis of	 an  allegedvaluation report of a firm of surveyors.  There was  anotheralleged resolution authorising the director for purchase  ofplots of Delhi Stores for Rs. 2,60,000.	 It may be mentionedthat  this  Delhi  Stores  was under  the  control  of	LalaShankarlal and, according to the prosecution, was a  defunctOrganisation  at  the  time.  The plan	envisaged  by  theseresolutions  was  that	cash was to be taken  out  from	 theJupiter partly by sale of securities and partly by pledge ofsecurities  and that money was to be shown as having been  aloan  to Caveeshar on the security of his  Delhi  propertiesand  a	further	 amount	 as having  been  invested  for	 thepurchase of plots of the Delhi Stores.	Lala Shankarlal	 wasto  receive  these amounts on behalf of	 Caveeshar  and	 theDelhi  Stores,	and pay over the cash that would  thus	comeinto  his hands to Bajaj and Khaitan as per  the  agreement.This appears-accordina to the prosecution case-to have	beenactually  done	in  the following  way.	  The  safe  custodyaccount	 of  the entire holdings of the	 securities  of	 theJupiter with the Bank of India was closed by a resolution ofthe new directors of the Jupiter dated January 11, 1949, andthese  securities were taken over into the personal  custodyof  Mehta.   Thereafter securities of the value	 of  Rs.  30lakhs were offered for sale through a broker who  ultimatelycould  sell only shares of the value of Rs. 15	lakhs.	 Forthe remaining Rs. 15 lakhs an. overdraft was raised with thePunjab167National  Bank on the application of Lala Shankarlal and  onthe  pledge  of	 some of the Government	 securities  of	 theJupiter.  The sale of securities realised Rs. 13,99,768	 andon  the	 pledge of securities a sum of	Its.  14,21,812	 wasobtained, making up a total of Rs. 28,21,580.  Rs. 28,15,000out  of it was shown as having been received by the Bank  ofIndia  and  credited in the cash-credit account of  the	 NewPrahlad	 Mills	Ltd.  It is thus that Khaitan  received	 thebalance of the money due under the agreement of December 29,1948.To  prove  this	 case a	 considerable  body  of	 prosecutionevidence  was  given consisting of quite a large  number  ofdetails.   It is necessary to set out the  salient  featuresthereof in broad outline as alleged and sought to be  provedby  the	 prosecution.  This may be dealt  with	convenientlywith  reference to three periods, the first  comprising	 theperiod	of  conspiracy	as mentioned  in  the  charge  i.e.,December 1, 1948, to January 31, 1949, the second,  relatingto the period from February 1, 1949, to the end of December,1949, and the third, the period covering the year 1950.First period : December 1, 1948 to January 31, 1949.The  negotiations for the purchase of the controlling  blockof shares of the Jupiter were carried on from about December10,  1948.  From 10th to 20th the negotiations were  throughone  Mayadas, introduced to Lala Shankarlal by	one  Chopra.Mayadas	 was  given. a letter of authority on  December	 15,1948,  by Lala Shankarlal, as the managing director  of	 theTropical,  authorising	him  to buy  for  the  Tropical	 thecontrolling  block of shares of the Jupiter at	the  maximumrate  of Rs. 49 per share with the promise of  brokerage  ofRs.  40,000 on completion of the transaction.	Chopra	alsowas  acting  with  Mayadas as broker.	These  persons	weredropped	 and the further negotiations from the 20th  onwardswere  carried  on  through  one	 Naurangrai  known  to	LalaShankarlal for about 40 years.	Through him the purchase  ofthe controlling block. of shares numbering 63,000 was agreedto  be	purchased at Rs. 53 per share.	The  total  purchasevalue  was Rs. 33,39,000. Khaitra asked for advance  paymentof Rs. 5,39,000 in168cash  and intimated that agreement would be made  mentioningonly  Rs.28  lakhs as the purchase  price.   Naurangrai	 wasplaced	in  possession	of  funds of  Rs.  5,39,000  on	 hisexecuting a pro-note dated December 23, 1948, (Ex.  Z-4) forthe  said  amount in favour of the Tropical by	two  chequessigned by Lala Shankarlal, one for Rs. one lakh on  December22,  1948  (Ex.	 Z-1) and another for  Rs.  4,39,000,  datedDecember 23, 1948, (Ex.	 Z-3).	These amounts were depositedby  Naurangrai in his bank account with the Bikanir Bank  atDelhi.	 On December 26, Lala Shankarlal and Naurangrai	 andKhaitan met at Bombay and further details were discussed  onthe 26th and 27th.  Khaitan insisted on previous payment  ofRs.  5,39,000.	 Lala  Shankarlal  asked  for  the  list  ofsecurities and shares, the valuation report and the  balancesheet  of the Jupiter.	Naurangrai returned back  to  Delhi,drew  Rs. 5 lakhs by way of cash from his bank	account	 andpaid therefrom a sum of Rs. 4,85,000 to Bajaj at  Ghaziabad.He  came  back to Bombay and informed Khaitan of  the  same.Thereupon  the	agreement,  Ex.	  Z-171,  was  executed	  onDecember  29,  1948.   The agreement was  to  the  followingeffect.	  The  Tropical	 was  to  pay  the  balance  of	 Rs.28,54,000 on or before January 20, 1949, and on such paymentthe  Jupiter's shares numbering 63,000 were to be  deliveredover.	The shareholder directors belonging to	the  Khaitangroup  should resign and nominees of the Tropical should  beappointed  as  directors in their place.   If  the  Tropicalfailed	to  pay within the stipulated time, a sum of  Rs.  5lakhs by way of damages was to be paid to Khaitan group	 andif  the Khaitan group failed to carry out their	 obligationsdamages of Rs. 2 lakhs were to be paid.	 Subsequent to	thisagreement it was ascertained that Khaitan had agreed to	 payNaurangrai  a  commission of Rs.  39,000.   Lala  Shankarlalundertook  to  pay the same and to that	 extent	 the  amountpayable by January 20, was understood to be reduced.  There-fore,  the  sum payable under the agreement with  the  aboveadjustment was Rs. 28,15,000.  The agreement was signed bothby  Khaitan on behalf of the New prahlad Mills	Ltd.,  whichowned the controlling block169of  shares of the Jupiter and Lala Shankarlal on  behalf  ofthe  Tropical.	On the very same date a meeting of the	thenBoard  of  directors  of the Jupiter was  called.   At	thismeeting	 1,250 shares were transferred in the names of	LalaShankarlal,  Kaul, Mehta, Jhaveri and Doshi, 250 shares	 foreach,  in  order  to qualify them  for	becoming  directors.Transfer of these shares was confirmed by resolution.  It isthe  prosecution case that for these transfers no money	 waspaid  by  the transferees concerned.  At  that	meeting	 thevarious	 persons  who  constituted  the	 previous  directorstendered  their resignations in successive stages.  At	eachstage the resignations were accepted by thE rest of the pre-existing  directors and new directors of  Lala	Shankarlal'sgroup  were co-opted.  In the net result the entire  Khaitangroup  of  directors made way for the  new  Lala  Shankarlalgroup  of directors and Lala Shankarlal became the  managingdirector.  Thereafter there was the first meeting of the newdirectorate of the Jupiter on January 4, 1949.	On that dateKaul  was  appointed director-in-charge.  A  new  Life	sub-committee  consisting  of  Mehta,  Jhaveri  and	 Doshi	 wasappointed as also a new finance sub-committee consisting  ofLala  Shankarlal, Kaul and Mehta, to review  the  investmentposition  of the company and to invest the company's  moneysupon  such securities, shares and stocks, in such manner  asthe committee thought fit.  A power of attorney was  grantedto Lala Shankarlal as the managing director.  Kaul and Mehtawere  authorised  individually	to  operate  upon  %%II	 thebanking	 accounts  in the name of the company with  all	 thebanks.	 Three	policyholder directors as also	the  generalmanager,   Joel,  resigned  and	 their	 resignations	wereaccepted.   This was followed by another meeting of the	 newdirectorate on January 11.  At that meeting the Board passeda  number  of  resolutions  about some	of  which  there  isconsiderable  controversy and with reference to which  thereis the evidence of one Subramaniam for the prosecution.	 Oneof  the	 undisputed  resolutions  of  that  meeting  was  towithdraw  a letter written by the previous  general-manager,Joel,  dated January 3, 1949.  By that letter  (Ex.   Z-30),Joel had written to the Bank 22170of India, Safe Custody Department, instructing the bank thattill  further  advice, they should not transfer any  of	 thesecurities  held by the bank on behalf of the  company.	  OnJanuary ll, 1949, a copy of this resolution was sent to	 thebank under the signature of Mehta for their information.  Byanother letter of the same date sent by the sub-manager, oneBaxi, (Ex.  Z-32) the bank was instructed to close the	safecustody account and to hand over the entire holdings of	 thesecurities  of	the Jupiter to Mehta.  Accordingly  all	 thesecurities  were brought into the office of the Jupiter	 andkept  in a steel cupboard.  Two of the disputed	 resolutionsof  January II, were resolutions Nos. 7 and 8, one for	saleof  securities	of the Jupiter of the face value of  Rs.  15lakhs  at  the market rate, and the other for  an  overdraftaccount	 of  Rs. 14 lakhs with the Punjab National  Bank  onpledge	of the Government securities of the Jupiter.   Afterthe  entire  shares and securities were withdrawn  from	 thesafe  custody  of the bank, Kaul contacted one	Jagirdar,  asub-broker  working  in	 the firm  of  Messrs.	 HarkisondasLaxmidas, share brokers, and authorised them by letter	(Ex.Z-36)  dated  January  13, 1949, to  sell  three  per  cent.conversion  loan 1946 of the face value of Rs. 30  lakhs  atthe best market rate.  The brokers sold on the 13th and 14thsecurities  of the face value of Rs. 15 lakhs and told	Kaulthat the market was dropping and that further sale of  thosesecurities was not feasible.  The sale of securities of	 theface value of Rs. 15 lakhs realised a sum of Rs.  13,99,788.Kaul, on behalf of the Jupiter, opened a current account  onJanuary	 13,  in the Punjab National Bank, Bombay.   On	 the15th, Kaul, on behalf of the Jupiter, sent two letters,	 oneto  the	 Punjab	 National Bank and another to  the  Bank  ofIndia,	 stating  that	they  were  forwarding	per   bearerGovernment securities of the face value of Rs. 14 lakhs	 andRs.   I	 lakh  respectively and instructed  those  banks  todeliver	 them  to  Messrs.   Harkisondas  Laxmidas   againstpayment	 and the proceeds to be credited to the	 account  ofthe company.  The above sale proceeds were accordingly	paidinto the respective banks and the securities were  deliveredover to the respective parties on January 17,171It  is the prosecution case that meanwhile  Lala  Shankarlalapproached  the Punjab National Bank, Kashmere Gate  Branch,Delhi,	on  January 17, 1949, for the purpose of  raising  aloan  on  Government promissory notes.	He  opened  a  cash-credit account on the pledge of securities of the face valueof  Rs. 15 lakhs and passed a promissory note in  favour  ofthe  bank for the said amount.	A loan of Rs. 14  lakhs	 wasthen  granted and a demand draft dated January 17, for	thatamount in favour of the Jupiter on the Punjab National Bank,Currimjee  House  Branch,  Bombay, was issued.	 A  list  ofsecurities  pledged with the bank for the purpose  has	beenput in evidence.  The demand draft was brought to Bombay andcredited  into the account of the Jupiter in  the  CurrimjeeHouse  Branch  of  the Punjab National	Bank  at  Bombay  onJanuary 18. Thus by the sale and the pledge of the Jupiter'sown  securities, a sum of Rs. 27,99,768 was raised and	keptavailable for use.  On January 19, Mehta wrote to the PunjabNational Bank, Currimjee House Branch, Bombay, to pay a	 sumof Rs. 28,15,000 to the Bank of India where the New  PrahladMills  Ltd. (Khaitan) had got 61,394 Jupiter's shares  lyingin cash. credit account and to take delivery of those shareson  behalf of the Tropical and to debit Rs.  28,15,000	fromthe  Tropical account with them.  On the same  date,  Mehta,wrote  also to the Bank of India, requesting it	 to  deliver61,394	shares of the Jupiter to the Punjab  National  Bank,Currimjee House Branch, Bombay, with relevant transfer	deedagainst payment of Rs. 28,15,000 with reference to Khaitan'searlier instructions to the Bank by his letter dated January3, 1949 (Ex. Z-44).  On the 19th, Mehta issued a cheque	 forRs.  75,000  on	 the  Indian  Bank,  Tropical  account	 anddeposited  the same in the Punjab National  Bank,  CurrimjeeHouse  Branch,	Bombay, Jupiter account.   This	 cheque	 wascredited  into that account on the 20th.  On the  same	day,i.e.,  19th,  Mehta wrote a letter to  the  Punjab  NationalBank, Illaco House Branch, Bombay, in which the Jupiter	 hadits account to transfer the account into the Punjab NationalBank., Currimjee House Branch, where, on the 13th, Kaul172opened	a  current account for the Jupiter.  Now  with	thisdeposit the money to the credit of the Jupiter in the PunjabNational  Bank, Currimjee House Branch, was  Rs.  28,74,768.According  to the prosecution it was in reality out of	thisamount that Khaitan was ultimately paid on January 20, by  acheque	for  Rs. 28,15,000 as against the  transfer  of	 thestipulated  number  of shares.	It is the  prosecution	casethat this payment was camouflaged by certain apparent inter-mediate transactions.  The prosecution case relating to thismay now be stated.From January 18 to 20, 1949, five cheques were issued on theJupiter	 account in the Punjab National Bank which were	 alldeposited  into	 the account of the Tropical in	 the  PunjabNational Bank as follows:1.A cheque for Rs. 2,55,050, dated January 18, 1949,  signedby  Kaul  on behalf of the Jupiter in favour  of  the  DelhiStores	and  endorsed  in favour of the	 Tropical  by  Guha,purporting  to	be the director of the Delhi  Stores,  whichaccording  to the prosecution, he was not.  This  was  againendorsed by Mehta on behalf of the Tropical in order to	 putit into the Tropical account.2.Two cheques dated January 19, 1949, for Rs. 14,36,000	 andRs. 1,42,450, on the Jupiter account of the Punjab  NationalBank in favour of the Tropical or order.  These cheques	 arealleged	 to be written by Guha and signed by Kaul on  behalfof  the	 Jupiter, and endorsed on the reverse  by  Mehta  onbehalf	of the Tropical for deposit in the Tropical  accountof the Punjab National Bank.3.Two  cheques dated January 20, 1949, for Rs. 8,96,000	 andRs.  36,000, on the Jupiter account of the  Punjab  NationalBank in favour of the Tropical or bearer.  Both the  chequeswere  written  by Guha and signed by Kaul on behalf  of	 theJupiter.All  these  five cheques were deposited	 into  the  Tropicalaccount	 of the Punjab National Bank by a pay-in-slip  datedJanuary	 20, 1949, alleged to be in the handwriting of	Guhaand  signed by him on the 19th.	 The total of these  chequescomes to Rs. 27,65,700.	 As a result of173the previous instructions given on January 19, by Mehta,  tothe  Punjab National Bank, the Bank paid on January,  20,  asum of Rs. 28,15,000, from the Tropical account to the	Bankof  India and took delivery of 61,394 shares of the  Jupiterfrom  the  Bank of India and the Punjab National  Bank	thenheld  those shares for the Tropical in the Tropical  accountand Khaitan was paid on the last date stipulated.  It  wouldappear that including the 1,250 qualifying shares previouslytransferred, the shares transferred by Khaitan fell short ofthe 63,000 shares, by 356 shares, but the deficit appears tohave been made up very shortly thereafter.Now,  according	 to  the prosecution, this  payment  of	 theJupiter's money for the purchase of the Jupiter's shares wasby  means of ex facie payment from funds of the Tropical  inthe  Punjab  National  Bank which were	brought	 up  to	 therequisite level by the deposit of five cheques as  specifiedabove  in relation to a scheme of camouflaged payment to  begathered from certain resolutions of the new directorate  ofthe  Jupiter  as  they now appear from	its  resolutions  ofJanuary	 11 and 20, 1949 and later confirmed on January	 22.By  resolution	No.  5, as it now appears,  a  loan  of	 Rs.25,15,000 was granted to Caveeshar on his application  datedJanuary	 4,  and the valuation report of N.  C.	 Kothari  ofMessrs.	  Master Sathe and Bhuta, surveyors.  This loan	 wason  the	 equitable  mortgage of	 Caveeshar's  properties  inDelhi,	the conditions being, a marketable title, period  ofloan three years, and other usual clauses in mortgage deeds.The resolution authorised Kaul to advance the above loan  onthe said terms and get all necessary documents executed	 andregistered at Delhi during the course of next eleven months.Resolution No. 6 authorised the purchase of certain plots inDelhi  said  to	 belong to Delhi Stores for  a	sum  of	 Rs.2,60,000.   On January 20, there was another meeting of	 thenew  directorate of the Jupiter at which the minutes of	 themeeting	 of January 11, were read and  adopted.	  ResolutionNo.  10	 thereof confirmed the payment of Rs.  25,10,650  toCaveeshar on equitable174mortgage  of his properties as per the	previous  resolutionNo.  5 of January 11.  Resolution No. 11  thereof  confirmedthe purchase of plots from the Delhi Stores and the  paymentof  Rs. 2,55,050 therefor.  Resolution No. 9  confirmed	 thesale of the Jupiter's securities of the face value of Rs. 15lakhs'	and  resolution No. 12 confirmed the pledge  of	 theJupiter's  securities of the face value of Rs. 15 lakhs	 forcash credit account with the Punjab National Bank for Rs. 14lakhs.Now,  on January 22, 1949, there purported to be,  accordingto the prosecution case, a meeting of the Board of directorsof  the Tropical including Lala Shankarlal.  Resolution	 No.11  thereof confirmed the purchase of 63,000 shares  of	 theJupiter	 on  behalf  of	 the  Tropical	for  Rs.  28,15,000.Resolution  No. 12 thereof confirmed the transfer of  48,399shares out of the above 63,000 shares to the Delhi Stores asagreed to by then.  By resolution No. 13, sale of the  head-office	building of the Tropical and certain plots  of	landbelonging to the Tropical to Caveeshar at Rs. 23,50,000	 andRs. 6,50,000 respectively as per agreement with Caveeshar bythe  managing  director, Lala Shankarlal,  on  December	 23,1948,  was confirmed.  By resolution No. 14, plots  of	landand  building in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, sold by the  managingdirector, Lala Shankarlal, at a cost of Rs. 2,60,000 to	 theDelhi  Stores,	was approved and confirmed.  It	 is  allegedthat  the resolutions of the Jupiter at the  meetings  dated11th  and 20th above noticed and of the Tropical  dated	 the22nd  disclosed	 the scheme of camouflaging which  has	beenresorted  to  screen  the  fact that  the  payment  for	 thepurchase  of  the Jupiter's shares was directly out  of	 theJupiter's amount.This,  according to the prosecution, indicates in its  broadoutline	  the  manipulations  resorted	to  for	 the   abovepurposes.   There is also evidence let in on behalf  of	 theprosecution  of	 a number of relevant details  such  as	 thepresence  or absence of the requisite entries and papers  inthe  various  books  of account and  other  records  of	 theconcerned  organisations, the Jupiter, the Tropical and	 theDelhi Stores.  Evidence has also been given to show which ofthe accused was directly a175party  to  which of the various steps.	Direct	evidence  ofsome  of the ex-employees of the Jupiter, in  particular  ofone  Subramaniam and of another Rege, has, according to	 theprosecution,   considerable  bearing  on  the  events	thathappened during this period, which would, if accepted, go toindicate  the  devious	and dishonest  basis  of  the  abovealleged	 manipulations.	 In addition to the above  it  wouldappear that some of the	 shareholders who came to know aboutthese  transactions sent notices through solicitors  to	 thenew  directorate of the Jupiter and to some of	the  accusedpersons,   in	particular   Lala   Shankarlal	 and   Kaul,individually  warning them against the illegal and  improperdealings  with	the  funds of the company.  It	is  also  inevidence that two of the solicitors, Sethia and Joshi, fileda suit against the new directors on January 19, 1949, for aninjunction  restraining the directors from disposing of	 theJupiter's  securities so as to enable the Tropical  to	havethe  finances for the purchase of the controlling  block  ofthe  Jupiter's shares.	It is the suggestion of the  defencethat these notices were followed up by institution of a suitat  the	 instance of Khaitan himself,  and  that  ultimatelyafter  the money was paid on the 20th within the time,	theywere  dropped.	 Evidence  has	also  been  given  for	 theprosecution  about  the	 financial  condition  and  propertyholdings  of the Tropical, of the Delhi Stores, as  also  ofCaveeshar  to  show  that  none of them	 were  in  any	suchposition as to justify the various transactions put  throughin their names.	 In particular, evidence has been given thatCaveeshar  had no such property as could possibly justify  aloan  of  about Rs. 25 lakhs on his security  and  that	 thealleged	  valuation  report  was  non-existent	 or   bogus.Evidence was also given that the Delhi Stores was a  defunctcompany	 whose	only assets were (1) 39,750  shares  of	 theTropical of the book value of Rs. 10 per share which had  nomarket	quotation,  (2) other shares of book  value  of	 Rs.16,879,	 and (3) cash in the bank of Rs. 133-14-6,  and	 (4)book  debts of Rs. 93,40,414.  As against these debts it  issaid that the Delhi Stores had liability to sundry creditorsto the extent of Rs. 1,40,259-3-8.  The above,176in broad outline, is the nature of the evidence-relating  tothe first period.     Secondperiod : February 1, 1949, to the end of		      December, 1949.Now,  we  may take up the evidence relating  to	 the  secondperiod	commencing  from  February,  1949,  to	the  end  ofDecember,  1949.   The background relating to  this  period,according  to the prosecution is, that Lala  Shankarlal	 andhis other co-conspirators were fully aware of the  necessityof  showing the transactions of January, 1949, as no  longeroutstanding  as	 early as possible, so as to  escape  directscrutiny thereinto by the end of the calendar year and it issaid  that  therefore they made some  further  manipulationswith a view to show the moneys advanced to Caveeshar and theDelhi  Stores as having been returned before the end of	 theyear.	The events which led up to this may now be  noticed.On May 25, 1949, there was a meeting of the new	 directorateof  the	 Jupiter  at  which  Lala  Shankarlal  informed	 thedirectors  that	 Caveeshar was repaying his loan of  Rs.  25lakhs  and odd and out of that amount a sum of Rs. 14  lakhsmight  be  invested  in	 purchasing  40,000  shares  of	 theTropical and Rs.  II lakhs on the equitable mortgage of	 theTropical's  headoffice building.  Ultimately, however,	thiscontemplated  loan  of Rs. 11 lakhs to the Tropical  on	 theequitable  mortgage  of	 its head-office  building  did	 notmaterialise for one reason or other.  Thereafter,  accordingto the prosecution, there were brought into existence,	fivetransactions,  from May 25 to December 31, 1949, which	havebeen referred to in the evidence as follows:						 Rs.1.Raghavji  loan (5-11-1949) which resulted inrepayment of					 4,00,0002.Fresh	  Caveeshar  loan  (5-11-1949)	whichresulted in repayment of			 5,30,0003.Misri Devi loan (20-12-1949) which resultedin repayment  of				 1,00,0004. Purchase  of 54,000 Tropical shares(25-5-1949 to 20-12-1949) whichresulted in repayment of			14,00,0001775.Transfer of Caveeshar from the Tropical toJupiter	 account of balance (31-12-1949)which resulted in repayment of			   80,650 Total...					 25,10,650In  order to appreciate these transactions, it is  necessaryto set out a few more details.	Raghavji's son, Chandrakant,was  a member of the Forward Bloc, of which Lala  Shankarlalwas  one  of the leaders.  Chandrakant had  close  politicalassociations with Lala Shankarlal.  Raghavji was a gentlemanabout  80  years old and a resident of Cutch and had  a	 fewproperties  at	that place.  According to  the	prosecution,Chandrakant was persuaded to permit his father's name to  beused for the purpose of advancing some moneys on the footingof  an equitable mortgage by deposit of title deeds  of	 hisfather's  property in Cutch.  At a meeting of the  Jupiter'sdirectorate  dated November 5, 1949, a loan for Rs. 5  lakhson  the	 equitable  mortgage of	 Raghavji's  properties	 wassanctioned subject to valuation report and certain terms andconditions specified therein.  Notwithstanding that the loanwas  to	 be advanced on proper valuation  report  and  otherterms,	it is the prosecution case and evidence,  that	thissum of Rs. 5 lakhs was disbursed as follows: Rs. 3 lakhs  incash from the Jupiter's funds and Rs. 2 lakhs as having beenreceived  back	from  Caveeshar and paid  over	in  cash  toRaghavji.   The payment of these Rs. 2 lakhs was  really  bybook  adjustment showing Rs. 2 lakhs as having been paid  bythe  Tropical  to Caveeshar out of the moneys  of  Caveesharwith  the Tropical and this amount as having been paid	intothe Jupiter's account by Caveeshar and paid again out of  itto  Raghavji.	Out of the other Rs. 3 lakhs taken  in	cashfrom  the  Jupiter, Rs. 2 lakhs it is said was not  paid  toChandrakant  but was shown as having been paid by  Caveesharinto  the Jupiter's account in reduction of the	 debt  owingfrom   him  to	the  Jupiter.	The  net  result  of   theseadjustments  was that Rs. 4 lakhs out of the Caveeshar	loanwith the Jupiter was shown as reduced.	What23178became	of the other Rs. one lakh is not quite	clear.	 Thenext  transaction  is Caveeshar's fresh loan.  At  the	samemeeting	 of  the  Board of directors of	 the  Jupiter  datedNovember  5, 1949, whereat Raghavji's loan for Rs.  5  lakhswas   sanctioned,  a  further  loan  of	 Rs.  5,30,000	 wasauthorised  to	be advanced to Caveeshar against  pledge  ofshares	of  the	 People's  Insurance  Co.,  the	 period	  ofrepayment  being mentioned as two years.   This	 transactionmerely meant a book adjustment reducing the loan outstandingagainst	 Caveeshar  and	 a fresh loan to that  extent  on  adifferent  security.  This transaction further	reduced	 theoriginal  indebtedness of Caveeshar to the Jupiter  by	thisamount.	  The  third  item is the Misri	 Devi  loan.   At  ameeting	 of  the  Board of directors of	 the  Jupiter  datedDecember  20, 1949, an application for loan of Rs.  5  lakhsfrom  Misri Devi shown as the daughter of Lala	Dwaraka	 Das(though	 she was also the wife of Lala Shankarlal) was	saidto  have been considered and a loan in her favour for Rs.  5lakhs  on  the	security of her property in  New  Delhi	 wassanctioned  subject  to marketable title,  period  of  threeyears,	and other usual clauses.  In anticipation of  havingto  advance this loan a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs appears  to	havebeen sent on November 2 2, 1949, by Kaul, from the Jupiter'saccount in the Punjab National Bank, Bombay, to its  accountat Delhi.  Again on December 27, 1949, Kaul appears to	havesent a further sum of Rs. 2 lakhs from the Jupiter's accountin  the	 Punjab	 National Bank, Bombay, to  its	 account  atDelhi, by telegraphic transfer.	 Towards this loan a  chequeon  the Jupiter's account with the Punjab National  Bank  atDelhi  for Rs. 4 lakhs payable to self or bearer  was  givenand a sum of Rs. one lakh was shown as having been  receivedby  the Jupiter from Caveeshar through his Tropical  accountand shown as paid to Misri Devi.  This reduced the Caveesharloan  due  to the Jupiter by another Rs. one lakh.   At	 thesame  meeting  of December 20, a resolution  was  placed  onrecord	showing that at the instance of Lala  Shankarlal,  abargain	 was arranged on behalf of the Jupiter for  purchaseof 54,000 shares of the Tropical instead of 40,000 shares aspreviously contemplated in the resolution of the179directors  dated May 25, 1949, for the sum of Rs.  14  lakhsand purchase on this footing was confirmed.  The payment  ofRs. 14 lakhs by the Jupiter to the Tropical was adjusted  byshowing	 the  Tropical	as  having  paid  Rs.  14  lakhs  toCaveeshar and Caveeshar as having paid back to the Jupiter asum of Rs. 14 lakhs out of the original loan of Rs. 25 lakhsand  odd.,,,,  Thus in all, by these four  transactions	 theoriginal'  Caveeshar's loan on the security of	the  allegedproperties of Caveeshar was reduced by Rs. 24,30,000 leavinga  balance of Rs. 80,650.  This amount was adjusted by	bookentries	 on  December  31, showing a transfer  of  the	saidamount	from  his  Tropical account towards  credit  of	 theJupiter	 account.   Thus, by December 31, 1949,	 the  entireamount	of  Rs. 25 lakhs and odd advanced  to  Caveeshar  inJanuary,  1949, on the security of his properties  in  Delhiwas  shown  as having been wiped out leaving  a	 fresh	loanagainst	 him on November 5, 1949, for a sum of Rs.  5,30,000on the security of the shares of the Peoples Insurance Co.It  may	 be  recalled  here that  for  the  payment  of	 Rs.28,15,000  to  Khaitan	on January 20,	1949,  the  originalsource	of cash, according to the prosecution case, was	 thesum of Rs. 25,15,000 granted by way of loan to Caveeshar andRs. 2,60,000 paid to the Delhi Stores for purchase of  plotsof  the	 Delhi Stores.	Out of this the	 original  Caveesharloan  was,  by	the  end  of  1949,  shown  as	having	beencompletely  wiped  out	as  above stated.   So	far  as	 thepurchase of plots of the Delhi Stores is concerned, it wouldappear	that  though in fact the Delhi Stores  had  no	suchplots to sell, this transaction was shown as put through  inthe following way.  The resolution of the Board of directorsof the Tropical dated January 22, 1949, showed certain plotsof land and the building 'in Chandni Chowk, Delhi, belongingto the Tropical, as having been sold to the Delhi Stores forthe  price of Rs. 2,60,000.  Putting these  two	 resolutionstogether,  it  would  appear that the drawing'	out  of	 Rs.2,60,000 from the Jupiter's funds by virtue of the  relevantresolution  dated  January 11, 1949, was  substantially	 thepayment180of  Rs. 2,60,000 by the Jupiter for the alleged purchase  ofplots  of land and building in Chandni Chowk which  belongedto  the Tropical.  It does not appear that in  its  ultimateeffect this transaction invited serious scrutiny and commentand there is nothing on the record to show that any  furtherattempt	 was made to  camouflage this transaction  by  freshtransactions.Now  in	 addition to these transactions during	this  secondperiod	there is the evidence given by the prosecution of  anumber	of other details during this period.  Of  these	 themost important is that which relates to a notice sent on May13,  1949, by an ex-employee of the Jupiter,  Rege,  throughsolicitors  to Lala Shankarlal and Kaul, alleging  fraud  inrespect of purchase of 63,000 Jupiter's shares from Khaitan.This was followed up by him by a misfeasance petition  datedAugust 10, 1949, in the High Court of Bombay against all thedirectors  of  the  Jupiter,  and  this	 in  its  turn	led,according  to  the  prosecution,  to  certain	intimidatingactions	 against  Rege	said  to have  been  taken  by	LalaShankarlal, Kaul and Mehta, as a result of which Rege, it issaid, was coerced into withdrawing his petition followed  bythe  ultimate  dismissal of that petition  by,	order  datedSeptember  15,	1949.  During this period  there  were	alsoacute differences between the directors on one side and	 thebrokers, Chopra and Mayadas, on the other for the  brokerageof  Rs.	 40,000	 to  which, according  to  them,  they	wereentitled  for the original negotiations carried out  throughthem with the Khaitan group for purchase of the	 controllingblock of the Jupiter's shares.	It is also said that  duringthis  period various ante-dated entries, vouchers and  otherdocuments  were brought into existence in order to  show  anappearance of regularity with reference to the	transactionsduring	the  period  of conspiracy in  December,  1948,	 andJanuary,  1949.	  There	 are also certain  letters  of	thisperiod	found or seized from the office of the	Tropical  ofthe dates of August 10, December 21 and 22, 1949, purportingto  have been written, the first by Kaul to Lala  Shankarlaland the second and third by Guha to Lala Shankarlal.   Theseletters, if true,181are  revealing,	 but  are of course  evidence  only  againstthemselves.   It is of some importance for  the	 prosecutioncase  against  Caveeshar to notice that there are  also	 twoletters	 of  this  period alleged to be	 from  Caveeshar  toChopra	dated  March 17 and 30,1949, the  first	 authorisingChopra	 to  arrange  for  negotiations	 to   purchase	 thecontrolling  block  of shares of the Empire  of	 India	LifeAssurance Co. Ltd. and the second offering to bring about  asettlement  in	connection  with the  claim  by	 Chopra	 andMayadas	 for  commission  relating to the  purchase  of	 theJupiter's shares.	 Third period: During the year 1950.The events of the third period as alleged by the prosecutionand  in respect of which the prosecution has given  evidencemay  now  be  stated.  The main argument on  behalf  of	 theappellants  before  us relates to the admissibility  of	 theevidence  relating to this period.  The background  for	 theevents	of this period was-according to the  prosecution-thesituation  that arose from the strong attitude taken by	 theauditors in the course of their audit of the affairs of	 theJupiter	 for the year 1949, which was taken up at  the	com-mencement  of 1950.  The transactions of the Jupiter  duringthe  year 1949 which came under their scrutiny are  said  tohave  aroused their concern and this led them to probe	intothe circumstances relating to the original Caveeshar loan inJanuary, 1949, to the tune of Rs. 25,10,650.  On January  6,1950,  the auditors sent a letter to the  Jupiter  demandinginspection  of	the documents relating to the said  loan  ofCaveeshar.   This was followed up by a further letter  datedFebruary  6, from the auditors requesting for production  ofthe  copy  of the mortgage deed, valuation  report  and	 allother  documents and papers relating to this Caveeshar	loanas also for the inspection of papers and documents  relatingto  (1) Raghavji loan, (2) Fresh Caveeshar loan,  (3)  MisriDevi  loan, and (4) purchase of 54,000 Tropical	 shares	 forRs.  14 lakhs.	In that letter of February 6,  the  auditorsstated as follows:182"We  consider the above transactions  mostly  unconscionableand  we	 fail to understand how any  responsible  managementcould sell Government securities and invest the proceeds  ina  huge	 lot of shares in Tropical Insurance  Co.  Ltd.	 andlarge  advances	 on shares of Peoples  Insurance  Co.  Ltd.,loans  on properties in Cutch etc.  We do not see the  basison  which  nearly Rs. 26 per share of Rs. 10  was  paid	 forpurchase   of  Tropical	 Insurance  Company's  shares.	  Weconsider the position extremely serious and shall  thereforethank  you to immediately send a copy of this report to	 theSuperintendent	 of   Insurance	 and   also   appraise	 theshareholders of the contents of this report forthwith."No  reply thereto having been received, the auditors sent  acopy of their letter of February 6, to each of the directorsof  the	 Jupiter individually with a  forwarding  letter  onFebruary  14,  1950.  The next five months  were  taken	 up-according  to  the  prosecution	 -in  the  attempt  of	 thedirectors of the Jupiter to put off or to evade the auditorsby  involving  them in a good deal of  correspondence,	oralexplanation, personal meetings, and so forth but without theproduction  of	the various documents called  for  exceptingonly a few.  This resulted in a letter from the auditors  tothe  Jupiter  dated  July 24, 1950,  enclosing	their  draftreport	to the shareholders setting out their criticisms  ofthe  transactions  of the directors for the year  1949,	 andstating	 that  only a cancelled pronote of Caveeshar  and  areceipt by him were shown to them in respect of the mortgageloan of Rs. 25,10,650 to Caveeshar.  This, according to	 theprosecution,  was followed up by feverish activities of	 thedirectors to bring about the screening by repayment, of	 thetransactions from May to December, 1949, viz., (1) Caveesharfresh  loan, (2) Raghavji loan, (3) Misri Devi loan and	 (4)purchase of the Tropical shares.Repayment  of  Caveeshar fresh loan of Rs. 5,30,000  to	 theJupiter,  was done by raising money by sale of the  Tropicalsecurities and paying that money to the Jupiter in dischargeof  Caveeshar's	 fresh loan.  It appears that  the  Tropicalsecurities of the face value of183Rs. 6 lakhs were pledged with the Grindlays Bank, New Delhi,for  an overdraft account of the Tropical.  It is said	thatthese  Tropical	 securities  were  got	released  from	 theGrindlays  Bank	 by  substituting  for	them  the  Jupiter'ssecurities   of	 the  face  value  of  Rs.  5,30,000.	 Theprosecution  case  is  that  Kaul,  lifted  these  Jupiter'ssecurities  and	 gave them to Mehta and that Mehta  flew  toDelhi,	handed over these securities to the  Grindlays	Bank(presumably  as belonging to the Tropical) and got  releasedthe  previously pledged Tropical securities.   The  Tropicalsecurities so released appear to have been sold on September12,  1950,  and	 to have realised  Rs.	5,01,592-1-2.	Thatamount	is  said to have been deposited	 in  the  Tropical'saccount	 with  the Indian Bank.	 On September 14,  Mehta  issaid  to have drawn a cheque for Rs. 5,30,000 on the  IndianBank  in favour of the Jupiter and sent it with	 a  coveringletter	to  the	 Jupiter stating that it  was  repayment  byCaveeshar  of his loan of Rs. 5,30,000 which had been  givento him by the Jupiter as per the Jupiter's resolution  datedNovember  5, 1949.  The necessary book entries are  said  tohave  been made, and a receipt for Rs. 5,30,000 is  said  tohave been sent to Caveeshar.  On October 27, 1950, Mehta  issaid to have brought a sum of Rs. 17,158-12-0 in cash to theroom  of  Kaul in the Jupiter's office and to have  paid  incash  to  the accountant of the Jupiter in the	presence  ofKaul and Guha.	This amount was credited on that date in theJupiter's  account  as payment of interest due	on  the	 twoloans  to  the	Jupiter	 by  Caveeshar.	  Thus	the  furtherCaveeshar's  loan was shown to have been  completely  repaidwith  interest	by  entries in	the  Jupiter's	books  datedSeptember 14 and October 27, 1950.  This was followed up  bythe inclusion of narration in the report of the Jupiter	 forthe  year  1949 that the loans advanced	 to  Caveeshar	withinterest  thereon  were fully paid back to the	Jupiter	 andthat  all  documents  pertaining  to  the  said	 loans	werereturned to Caveeshar.The  further adjustments for repayment of Raghavji loan	 andMisri  Devi  loan and in respect of the purchase  of  54,000Tropical  shares by the Jupiter in December, 1949, are	saidto be connected with the attempts184of the accused to acquire the controlling block of shares ofthe  Empire  of India Life Assurance Co.  Ltd.	(hereinafterreferred to as the Empire of India) in order to utilise	 thefunds thereof for these adjustments.  The details of how thecontrolling block of shares of that Company were  negotiatedfor and acquired are not necessary to be gone into in detailfor the purposes of this case and the same may be  mentionedin broad outline.It  is	part of the prosecution case that  anticipating	 thetrouble	 that was likely to arise from the  transactions  of1948  and 1949 with the auditors, Lala Shankarlal and  otherdirectors  conceived an idea as early as in March  and	May,1949,  to  purchase the controlling block of shares  of	 theEmpire	of India from one Ramratan Gupta.  There  appear  tohave  been some unfruitful negotiations in this	 behalf	 fornearly a year.	But finally by October 5, 1950, an agreementwas  executed  under which a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs was  to  bepaid in advance to Ramratan Gupta and another sum of Rs.  33lakhs  and  odd	 within	 thirty	 days  thereafter  and	 thecontrolling block of shares of the Empire of India of  2,618were to be handed over to one Damodar Swarup Seth, a nomineeof Lala Shankarlal.  This amount of Rs. 43 lakhs and odd  issaid to have been paid up by means of a number of cheques asfollows:					       Rs.1.On October 5, 1950-(i)  Cheque by Damodar Swarup Seth(Ex.  Z-10) for....			       8,00,000(ii) Cheque by Bhudev Sanghi in favourof Damodar Swarup Seth (Ex. Z-11) for...       2,00,000     Total of I				      10,00,00011. On October 16,1950, six chequesby Damodar     Swarup Seth in favour of-						Rs.(i) Reyer Mills Ltd. for....		       10,55,844(ii) Laxmi Ratan Cotton Mills for....		8,06,895     185(iii) Premkumar Gupta for......	       6,71,787(iv) Stores India Ltd. for....	 36,799(v) Gulabchand Jain for..     97,500(vi) Biharilal Ramcharan for5,04,072III. On October 27, 1950-(i)  Cheque by Damodar Swarup Seth(Ex.  Z-13) for				    2,08,650	     Total of II & III		   33,81,547The total of the first two cheques is Rs. 10 lakhs which waspaid  as advance.  Tee total of the remaining seven  chequescomes to Rs. 33,81,547 which was shown as consideration	 forthe purchase of 2,618 shares of the Empire of India.   Thus,on  the	 payment of Rs. 31,72,897 on October  16,  1950,  bymeans  of the six cheques above mentioned,  the	 controllingblock of 2,618 shares of the Empire of India was handed overto  Damodar Swarup Seth.  It is the case of the	 prosecutionthat  Damodar  Swarup Seth was able to	draw  these  variouscheques of the total value of over Rs. 43 1/2 lakhs  becausecertain	 securities of the Jupiter set out in Ex.   Z-47  ofthe  face  value of Rs. 48,75,000 were	withdrawn  from	 theJupiter in pursuance of letters written by Kaul and Guha andlifted away and handed over without due authority to DamodarSwarup Seth who opened a cash credit account with the PunjabNational Bank on the strength of those securities.Having	thus secured the controlling block of shares of	 theEmpire	of  India in October, 1950, it	is  the	 prosecutioncase,  that  hurried  steps were taken	to  show,  that	 theRaghavji  loan and Misri Devi loan advanced by	the  Jupitertowards the end of 1949 were paid back with interest to	 theJupiter	 in  cash, and that the Tropical shares	 Which	wereshown  as having been purchased by the Jupiter in 1949	weresold  away  and	 realised  the	cash  for  which  they	werepurchased.   On	 October 17, 1950, the day  next  after	 thepurchase of the controlling block of shares of the Empire ofIndia,	one  Roshanlal	Kohli, a broker,  is  said  to	haveoffered to the Empire of India to sell from the24186Jupiter	 its securities of the face value of Rs.  20  lakhs.On October 19, 1950, Roshanlal Kohli, purporting to act	 forthe  Jupiter  wrote  to the Empire of  India  that  for	 thepurchase  an advance payment of Rs. 20 lakhs is to be  made.This  was  followed  by a reply from  the  Empire  of  Indiaagreeing to the same and an actual payment of the amount  bytwo  bearer cheques issued by the Empire of India,  one	 forRs. 15 lakhs dated October 26, 1950, and the other for Rs. 5lakhs dated October 27, 1950.  No entry is said to have beenmade  in  the Jupiter's records as to the  receipt  of	thisamount	though	an  entry of such payment was  made  in	 therecords	 of the Empire of India.  But it is said  that	thisamount	of  Rs.	 20 lakhs was  utilised	 for  adjusting	 theRaghavji loan as well as the purchase of the Tropical sharesby the Jupiter.	 It is the prosecution evidence that Rs.  14lakhs out, of Rs. 15 lakhs obtained on the bearer cheque  ofOctober	 26 was paid in cash into the Jupiter  account	withthe  Punjab  National  Bank, Bombay, on	 October  26  itselfshowing	 the  same as the sale proceeds of  54,000  Tropicalshares which the auditors had objected to as being an uncon-scionable investment.  The actual payment was made into	 theJupiter account of the Punjab National Bank, Bombay, by	 oneBhagwan	 Swarup	 and another Bhudev Sanghi.   A	 letter	 wasobtained,  signed  by  Bhudev  Sanghi  (a  nephew  of	LalaShankarlal)   (Ex.   Z-152)  that  54,000  Tropical   sharesbelonging  to the Jupiter were sold by him as a broker,	 andthat  the sale proceeds thereof were credited that day	intothe  account of the Jupiter in the Punjab National  Bank  atBombay	and  the  corresponding entries	 were  made  in	 theinvestment  register  of  the  Jupiter.	  It  is  said	thatnotwithstanding	  this	transaction  the   Tropical   sharesremained  in the safe custody account of the Jupiter in	 theBank  of India right up to January 2, 1951, when on  receiptof a letter dated January 2,1951 (Ex.  Z-293) by Kaul to theBank  of  India,  they	delivered  all	his  shares.   TheseTropical  shares  appear to have been delivered	 over  to  aclerk of the Jupiter and handed over by him to Guha.  It  issaid  that  these shares are now no longer  traceable.	 Theother187bearer	cheque for Rs. 5 lakhs drawn from the funds  of	 theEmpire	of India, it is said, came into the Jupiter  accountas  follows and purported to be repayment of Raghavji  loan.A  sum of Rs. 5,18,388-14-3 was put in cash on	October	 27,1950, into the Comilla Bank purporting to show it as sent byRaghavji in repayment of the mortgage loan taken by him fromthe  Jupiter  with  interest thereon.  There  is  a  receiptissued by Kaul to Chandrakant, son of Raghavji, showing thatRs.  5,18,388-14-3  was received in full  repayment  of	 themortgage loan.	An entry was also made in the Jupiter's cashbook that interest was paid up-to-date.With regard to the repayment of Misri Devi loan in the booksof  the	 Jupiter there is an entry dated  October  7,  1950,showing a sum of Rs. 1,25,000 as withdrawn from the ImperialBank.  On the same date there is another entry showing a sumof Rs. 4,25,000 as withdrawn from the Bank of India, Bombay.On that very day, i.e., October 7, two cheques totalling Rs.5,50,000  were	deposited  with the  Punjab  National  Bank,Bombay.	 Kaul purported to send a letter to Lala  Shankarlalinforming him that the amount of Rs. 5,50,000 was being sentfor the purchase of land and building belonging to Sir SobhaSingh.	The Punjab National Bank, Bombay, was instructed  totransfer the above mentioned sum to their branch at TropicalBuilding  at  Delhi  to the credit of  the  account  of	 theJupiter.   All this was done between October 7 and  10.	  OnOctober	 10,  a memo was received from the  Punjab  NationalBank,  Tropical Building, Delhi, informing that the  sum  ofRs. 5,50,000 had been received by them.	 The next day, i.e.,on  October 11, a cheque for Rs. 5,50,000 was drawn on	thatBank  by Lala Shankarlal in his capacity as the	 managing  ,director  of the Jupiter.  On the reverse of this cheque  anendorsement  was  made	by  Lala  Shankarlal.	It  is	 thesuggestion  of the prosecution that cash was obtained on  itand  that  a demand draft for the said amount  was  obtainedfrom  the Grindlays Bank in favour of the Jupiter on  behalfof Misri Devi (wife of Lala Shankarlal) on October 12.	Thisdraft was signed on the reverse by Kaul.  It was188received  in  Bombay  and was  deposited  in  the  Jupiter'saccount in the Bank of India.  Misri Devi loan was for Rs. 5lakhs  and  a  sum  of Rs. 18,062-8-0 was  by  then  due  asinterest thereupon.  On October 16, entries were made in thecash book of the Jupiter showing that the loan of Misri Devifor  Rs.  5 lakhs with interest was recovered.	 The  excesspayment of Rs. 31,937-8-0 was shown in the first instance ascredited  to suspense account and thereafter as having	beenrefunded  to Misri Devi on October 18.	Thus the Misri	Deviloan  was shown in the books as having been also  completelyrepaid.Thus  by  these various adjustments and	 manipulations,	 thefour  transactions,  viz., (1) Caveeshar fresh loan  on	 thesecurity of the Peoples Insurance Company's securities,	 (2)Raghavji's loan on the security of his properties in  Cutch,(3) Misri Devi's loan on the security of her building in NewDelhi,	and  (4) purchase of 54,000 Tropical shares  by	 theJupiter, which were all strongly objected to along with	 theoriginal Caveeshar loan of Rs. 25 lakhs and odd, were  shownas  realised  back in actual cash by October  27,  1950.   Aletter	was  then written by the solicitors of	the  Jupiterunder  instructions  of Kaul to the auditors  to  attend  onOctober 28, 1950, at the office of the Jupiter and to verifythe accounts and moneys received from the repayments of	 theloans and from the sale of the Tropical shares.	 On  October29,  the  auditors  went to the office of  the	Jupiter	 andverified  the same and were satisfied that the	moneys	werereceived.  The repayment of these various loans and the saleof  the	 Tropical shares shown as having  been	realised  inactual	cash  would of course also clear up  the  objectionswhich the auditors raised as regards the original  Caveesharloan on account of the requisite papers relating thereto notbeing	forthcoming.	The  auditors,	having	 thus	beensatisfied,  signed the audit certificate and the  report  ofthe  Jupiter for the year ending 1949, and appended  a	notethat  they had objected to certain loans and  purchases	 andthat these loans had been recovered and that the shares	 hadbeen sold and the moneys received.			    189On  October  23,  1950,	 a.  general  body  meeting  of	 theshareholders   of  the	Jupiter	 was  held  at	which	LalaShankarlal,  Kaul, Mehta, Guha and Caveeshar,  were  presentand  the final report of the auditors and the reply  of	 thedirectors  to the original objections of the  auditors	wereread.  The directors asserted at the meeting that  imaginarymistakes and nervous suspicion was all that the auditors hadfound  in respect of their management for the year and	thatthe events of the last 12 months were a complete  refutationof the fear, suspicion and bias of the auditors.It is now necessary to trace the distribution of the lot  of63,000	shares of the Jupiter which were purchased  by	LalaShankarlal  and his group from Khaitan.	 It may be  recalledthat on January 20, 1949, only 61,061 shares which stood  inthe  name  of the New Prahlad Mills were handed	 over.	 Theremaining  1,939 shares which stood in the names  of  others(presumably  also  belonging to the group of  Khaitan)	weretransferred partly before and partly after, making up 63,000shares.	  Out of these, 250 shares each were transferred  atthe  outset  as	 qualifying shares, in	the  names  of	LalaShankarlal, Kaul, Mehta, Jhaveri and Doshi, totalling 1,250.These  transfers  were confirmed by the	 resolution  of	 thedirectors  of the Jupiter dated December 29, 1948.   Another250  shares  were transferred in the name of  Sarat  ChandraBose  on January 20, 1949, but it would appear that  he	 didnot  accept the same then and intimated	 his  non-acceptancesome  time  much later.	 On August 31, 1949,  37,949  shareswere  transferred  to the name of Delhi	 Stores	 and  14,601shares were transferred in the name of the Tropical and	 twofurther lots of 4,475 each were transferred in the names  ofLala  Shankarlal and Caveeshar.	 On September 13, 1950,	 outof  the	 lot of 37,949 shares standing in the  name  of	 theDelhi Stores, 4,000 shares were kept standing in the name ofthe Delhi Stores and the balance of 33,949 were	 distributedas follows:3025 shares in the name of Lala Shankarlal3025 shares in the name of Caveeshar50 shares in the name of Kaul7075 shares in the name of Mehta1907500 shares  in	 the name of Chandulal Ratanchand  Shah,  anemployee of the Tropical7500 shares  in the name of Himatlal F. Parikh, an  employeeof the Tropical5774 shares in the name of Himatlal Harilal Shah.Out  of	 the lot of 14,601 shares kept in the  name  of	 theTropical  7,500 shares were transferred to the name  of	 oneBaburam	 and  7,101 shares were transferred to the  name  ofKaul.	Out  of	 another  lot  of  409	shares	which	werepurchased, 339 shares were transferred to the name of  Kaul.Thus  the  position  of the distribution  of  the  purchasedJupiter's shares as on September 13, 1950, was as follows:7750 shares in the name of Lala Shankarlal7740 shares in the name of Kaul7325 shares in the name of Mehta7500 shares in the name of Caveeshar4000 shares in the name of the Delhi Stores7500 shares in the name of Chandulal Ratanchand7500 shares in the name of Himatlal F. Parikh5774 shares in the name of Himatlal Harilal Shah7500 shares in the name of Baburam250 shares in the name of Jhaveri250 shares in the name of Doshi250 shares in the name of Sarat Chandra Bose70 shares in the name of the Tropical.63,409 Total.This makes a total of 63,409 shares comprising 63,000 sharesof  the	 controlling block which were  originally  purchasedfrom  Khaitan  group and 409 shares  subsequently  purchasedwhich  has nothing to do with the present case.	 It  may  benoticed that no shares were transferred in the name of	Guhaand that very substantial number of shares were	 transferredin  the names of the various other accused.  It may also  benoticed that three persons who are not accused in the  case,viz.,  Chandulal  Ratanchand, Himatlal F.  Parikh,  HimatlalHarilal	 Shah,	had also very substantial number  of  sharestransferred to them.191The case of the prosecution is that for the transfer of	 allthese  shares in the names of the various accused  no  moneywas  paid by them and that it was the  distribution  amongstthemselves of the major portion of the original	 acquisitionof  63,000 shares which, according to the prosecution  case,were  in fact purchased by utilising the very funds  of	 theJupiter	 over  which  they  obtained  the  control.    This,according  to  the  pro. secution, completes  the  chain  ofmisappropriation by the various accused.Since  the appeals before the High Court and before  us	 areagainst	  the  convictions  and	 sentences  based   on	 theacceptance  of the verdict of the jury against each  of	 theaccused, scope for interference on appeal either by the HighCourt or by this Court is very limited.	 Hence Mr. Chari forthe  appellant	has  pressed  before  us  only	some   legalcontentions.  His main argument relates to the admissibilityof   certain  portions	of  the	 evidence  given   for	 theprosecution.   Mr. Chari has taken strong exception  to	 theprosecution having led evidence relating to the	 acquisitionof  the controlling block of shares of the Empire  of  Indiafollowed up by the various steps said to have been taken  bythe  several alleged conspirators or by Lala  Shankarlal  in1950  to screen the transactions of the later part of  1949.Mr.  Chari  contends  that  on	the  substantive  charge  ofconspiracy all these steps or actings are not admissible  inlaw.Now  the conspiracy as charged is in substance a  conspiracyto  commit criminal breach of trust in respect of the  fundsof  the	 Jupiter  by  utilising the  same  to  purchase	 thecontrolling  block of shares of the Jupiter itself for	:thebenefit	 of  the  Tropical  (or	 for  the  benefit  of	 theconspirators).	 This  conspiracy is alleged  to  have	beenentered into between the dates December 1, 1948, and January31,  1949.   Mr. Chari says that primarily it  is  only	 theevents	of  that period comprising the	acts,  writings	 andstatements of the various conspirators of that period  whichwould be admissible as against each other under s. 10 of theIndian	Evidence  Act, 1872 (I of 1872).  According  to	 theprosecution case the modus operandi was to screen192the  utilisation  of these funds by showing them  as  havingbeen advanced for legitimate purposes and invested on propersecurity, but in fact utilising the same for payment to	 theowners	of the controlling block of shares of  the  Jupiter.Mr.  Chari  says  that strictly speaking,  though  for	thispurpose,  only	the  acts, writings and	 statements  of	 theconspirators  during the period December, 1948, to  January,1949,  would  be admissible, he conceded that  the  evidencerelating  to  the  steps taken and the	acts,  writings	 andstatements of the conspirators beyond January 31, 1949,	 andduring the year 1949, i.e., towards the later part  thereof,by  way	 of creating further  transactions  (viz.,  Raghavjiloan, Caveeshar fresh loan, Misri Devi loan and purchase  ofshares	 from	the  Tropical)	in  order  to	screen	 thetransactions  of January, 1949, may be admissible, as  beingdirectly connected, and that he does not object to the same.But his point is that the transactions of the year 1950	 andthe  steps taken then are only for the purpose of  screeningthe second set of transactions of the later part of 1949 andnot  the  first set of transactions of	January,  1949.	  Hecontends that evidence relating thereto, which falls  whollyoutside the conspiracy period, is not admissible under s. 10of  the Evidence Act being too remote and having  no  directbearing	 on the original transactions which are the  subjectmatter	of the conspiracy.  He points out that	the  allegedcriminal breach of trust was committed on January 20,  1949,when the Jupiter's moneys were paid to Khaitan, and that theobject of the conspiracy must be taken to have been achievedwhen the camouflage through the first Caveeshar loan and theadvance	 said  to  have been made to the  Delhi	 Stores	 forpurchase of plots was effectuated.  He points out that	thisis a case with numerous details even as regards the  events,statements  and	 actings from December 1, 1948,	 to  end  ofDecember,  1949.  He urges that the events of the year	1950are  equally, if not more, voluminous and have	overburdenedthe  legitimate material in the case.  This, he	 urges,	 hasoperated  to create confusion and prejudice in the minds  ofthe jury.  We have been told that on account193of   this  large  volume  of,  what  is	 contended  to	 be,inadmissible  evidence	the trial has got  unduly  prolongedextending  over	 a year.  It is pointed out  that  the	verynarration of the outline of the prosecution case and of	 theevidence let in on behalf of the prosecution has taken about100  pages of typed matter in the charge to the jury by	 thelearned trial Judge and in the judgment of the High Court onappeal.	 There can be no doubt that in a case of this  kind,having regard to the nature thereof and to the ramificationsof the various transactions on which the prosecution  reliesto  make out its case, and having regard to the,  fact	thatthis  was a jury trial, every attempt should have been	madeto exclude material which is strictly not admissible in law.Otherwise it would have the effect of confusing the jury andprejudicing  its  mind.	  But if  the  evidence	 is  clearlyadmissible  in	law,  the Court would not  be  justified  indeclining  to receive it.  All that can be said is  that  itwould have to take every care in charging the jury to  placefairly	before it the effect and implications of such  itemsof evidence in an adequate measure.The  limits of the admissibility of evidence  in  conspiracycases	under	s.  10	of  the	 Evidence  Act	 have	beenauthoritatively	 laid  down by the Privy  Council  in  MirzaAkbar v. The King-Emperor (1).	In that case their Lordshipsof  the	 Privy Council held that s. 10 of the  Evidence	 Actmust be construed in accordance with the principle that	 thething  done,  written,	or spoken,  was	 something  done  incarrying out the conspiracy and was receivable as a step  inthe  proof  of the conspiracy.	They  notice  that  evidencereceivable  under  s. 10 of the Evidence  Act  of  "anythingsaid,  done, or written, by any one of such  persons"  (i.e.conspirators)	must  be  "in  reference  to  their   commonintention."  But  their Lordships held that in	the  context(notwithstanding  the  amplitude of the	 above	phrase)	 thewords  therein	are not capable of  being  widely  construedhaving regard to the well-known principle above	 enunciated.It  would  seem to follow that where, as in this  case,	 thecharge specifies the period(1)  (1940) L.R. 67 I.A. 336.25194of  conspiracy, evidence of acts of co-conspirators  outsidethe  period  is not receivable in  evidence.   Indeed,	thisposition  is  fairly conceded by Mr. Khandalawala,  for	 theprosecution.   But  his	 contention  is	 that  the  evidenceobjected  to,  viz., the acts and events of the	 year  1950,would  be relevant under the other sections of the  EvidenceAct such as ss. 6, 8, 9, 11 and 14.  This would no doubt  beso.  But it has to be remembered that some of these sectionsare  widely  worded  and must  receive	a  somewhat  limitedconstruction  as  pointed  out by West J.  in  his  judgmentreported in Reg. v. Prabhudas (1) when considering the scopeof s. 1 1 of the Evidence Act.Now,  there  can be no doubt that one of the  main  relevantissues	in the case is whether the loan of Rs. 25 lakhs	 andodd advanced on January 20, 1949, to Caveeshar, as also	 themoneys said to have been paid to the Delhi Stores by way  ofadvance for purchase of certain plots said to belong to	 it,were  genuine  transactions or bogus and  make-believe.	  Ifthey were genuine transactions, by virtue of which money didpass  to them on the basis of good security,  showing  theseamounts to be genuine business investments, then it would bedifficult to make out that there was any criminal breach  oftrust.	Hence all evidence which would go to show that thesetransactions are bogus, is certainly admissible.  That wouldbe  so	notwithstanding that such evidence  may	 necessitatereference  to and narration of the acts of the	conspiratorsbeyond	the  period  of	 conspiracy  but  within  reasonablelimits.	 While it may be true that the manipulations by	 wayof  the four fresh transactions from May to  December,	1949(apart	from other features of these transactions  of  whichevidence  has been given) would be cogent evidence  to	showthat  the  original transactions were  bogus,  the  evidencerelating  to  the  further  transactions  to  screen   thesetransactions  of  the second half of 1949 by  utilising	 themoney  of  the Empire of India after obtaining	the  controlthereof,   and	 by  wrongfully	 utilising   the   Jupiter'ssecurities, would also be relevant to make out and emphasisethe bogus character of the(1)(I 874) 1 1 Bom.  H.C.R. 90.195original debts.	 It cannot be said to be too remote  becauseit  is	to  be remembered, as has been pointed	out  by	 Mr.Khandalawala,  that the urgent necessity for  acquiring	 thecontrol of the Empire of India in 1950, and for utilising itfor  showing the alleged investments of the second  half  of1949 as having been realised back in cash in 1950, arose  onaccount	 of the firm attitude of the auditors who  suspectedthe  bona' fides of the original Caveeshar loan and  of	 theconnected transactions of the second half of 1949 when	theyscrutinised in 1950 the affairs of the Jupiter for the	year1949.	The  1950 transactions appear clearly to  have	beenbrought	 about not merely to screen the transactions of	 thesecond	half of 1949, but equally, if not mainly, to  dispelany  suspicion, and to obviate the scrutiny, in	 respect  ofthe earlier transactions of January, 1949, which related  tothe  period  of conspiracy.  Thus in relation  to  the	mainpurpose	 of  the  prosecution,	viz.,  proof  of  the  boguscharacter  of  these  transactions  of	January,  1949,	 thetransactions of the second half of 1949 and of 1950 must, inthe  circumstances  of this case and having  regard  to	 theramifications,	be  taken  to be  integrally  connected	 andrelevant  to  make  out	 their	bogus  character.   We	are,therefore,  unable to agree with the general  objection	 putforward	 that  the  entire evidence  relating  to  the	1950transactions was inadmissible in evidence.It  is also reasonably clear that the conduct in general  ofeach individual co-conspirator including his acts,  writingsand statements is evidence against himself.  There can be nodoubt that such conduct irrespective of the time to which itrelates	 can  be relied on by the prosecution  to  show	 thecriminality of the intention of the individual accused	withreference  to  his  proved  participation  in  the   allegedconspiracy,  that is, to rebut a probable defence which	 maynormally arise in such a case, viz., that the participation,though proved, was innocent.  It has been pointed out to  usthat in this case each one of the accused has put forward inhis defence that he was an unconscious tool in the hands  ofa   towering  personality  and	a  master-mind	 like	LalaShankarlal about whose criminal intentions he was196not  aware.   It was, therefore, quite	legitimate  for	 theprosecution to anticipate such defence and to give rebuttingevidence.   Such  evidence  would come under s.	 14  of	 theEvidence  Act.	 It  is well settled that  the	evidence  inrebuttal  of  a	 very likely and  probable  defence  on	 thequestion of intention can be led by the prosecution as	partof  its	 case.	This is laid down by the  Privy	 Council  inMakin  v. The Attorney-General for New South  Wales(1).	  Toanticipate  a  likely  defence in such a case  and  to	giveevidence in rebuttal of such defence is in substance nothingmore  than the letting in of evidence by the prosecution  ofthe requisite criminal intention beyond reasonable doubt.Now  Mr.  Khandalawala for the prosecution  urges  that	 theentire	evidence  for the prosecution relating to  the	year1950  falls  within  these  two	 categories  of	  admissibleevidence, viz., (1) evidence to make out the bogus characterof  the original transactions of January, 1949, which is  anessential   issue   in	the  case  relating   to   all	 theconspirators, and (2) evidence of the criminal intention  ofeach  of the accused which is admissible as against  himselfMr.  Chari for the appellants contests this  assumption	 andurges  that the evidence that has been admitted of the	year1950 is much wider than what is covered by the above two andthat  it was in fact and in substance evidence of the  acts,writings  and  statements of individual	 conspirators  of  aperiod	outside	 the period of conspiracy,  and	 treated  asadmissible  against  other co-conspirators, on	the  centralissues in the case, viz., whether a conspiracy has been madeout and whether the individual accused were participants  inthat  conspiracy.  Mr. Chari very strenuously contends	thatsuch  evidence was inadmissible and that its  admission	 hasseriously  prejudiced  the case of the	appellants  and	 hasrendered any fair and rational consideration of the case  bythe  jury  extremely  difficult,  if  not  impossible.	  Inparticular his strong objection was to the evidence relatingto  the acts, writings and statements of Lala Shankarlal  ofthe year 1950, more particularly because he died before	 thetrial and was 'not before the Court on(1)  L.R. [1894] A.C. 57,65.197trial	as  a  conspirator.   His  contention	raises	 forconsideration two questions, viz.,(1)whether  such  evidence is admissible in proof  of  theconspiracy  and in proof of the participation of  individualaccused in the conspiracy, and(2)whether  in	fact  at  the  trial,  such  evidence  wasadmitted and made use of on these issues.Now  it would be convenient to take up the  latter  questionfor consideration in the first instance.To substantiate his contention that the evidence of  conductof  individual	conspirators  of  the  year  1950  has	beenadmitted and used against the other coconspirators in  proofof  the two main issues, Mr. Chari, in his  argument  beforethe  High  Court relied on the following paragraphs  of	 thelearned	 trial Judge's charge to the jury, viz.,  paras	 II,55,  65, 73, 74, 75, 94, 101, 102, 136, 146, 388, 453,	541,557,  588,  602, 657, 676, 678 and 689.	 We  have  carefullygone through these paragraphs.	It appears to us  reasonablyclear  that what have been referred to by the learned  trialJudge  in these paragraphs are various items of evidence  inthe  prosecution, case whose primary object is to  make	 outthe  bogus character of the transactions in question  thoughthey   necessarily  bring  in  either  the   deceased	LalaShankarlal or some other co-conspirator as being a party  tothese  various acts.  Such evidence, as already	 stated,  isobviously admissible for that purpose as being links in	 thechain  of  evidence relating to the bogus character  of	 theoriginal  transactions	and  not  as  being  in	  themselvesrelevant  to prove the conspiracy.  That the  learned  trialJudge  was  alive  to this distinction and  would  not	haveadmitted  such evidence in proof of the issue of  conspiracyis  quite clear from his ruling (interlocutory judgment	 No.6)  dated August 22, 1955, relating to the admissibility  ofthe  document which was marked as Ex. Z-71 in the  committalcourt.	 The learned Judge in that order  has  categoricallyruled  out  the	 admissibility of  that	 document  with	 thefollowing conclusion after a good deal of discussion of	 thelegal point:"  I come to the conclusion that the statements and  actionsof any one of the persons mentioned in the198charge	are not admissible beyond the period  of  conspiracyunless they are authorised by any of the accused persons; inthat  event  they are really the actions and  statements  ofthat accused person himself who has authorised the same.  I,therefore,  do	not  admit  the	 document  (Ex.	  Z-71)	  inevidence.  "We have not got before us the document (Ex.  Z-71) itself toenable us to see for ourselves what it relates to, since  itwas  exhibited only in the committal court and ruled out  atthe trial.  But there is no difficulty in appreciating	whatthe  learned  trial Judge actually held.  That	the  learnedtrial Judge acted on this view is reasonably clear also fromthe  fact that in quite a number of places in his charge  tothe  jury  he  has  repeatedly	emphasised  that  subsequentconduct	 of  a conspirator would not be	 admissible  againstanybody	 else  but himself. (See paras 453, 541,  557,	588,602,  657,  676, 685 and 689 of the  learned  trial  Judge'scharge	to  the jury).	No doubt in some of  the  paragraphspreviously noticed as having been objected to by Mr.  Chari,the  very reference to acts and conduct of  Lala  Shankarlalduring	the  year  1950	 which	is  beyond  the	 period	  ofconspiracy,  may  conceivably be capable  of  being  wronglyrelied on by the jury in respect of issues on which they arenot  admissible	 and  might be	capable	 of  producing	someprejudice.  But this is a possibility inherent in such casesas  has	 been  pointed out by the  Privy  Council  in  WalliMuhammad  v. King (1).	Therein their Lordships pointed	 outthe difficulty in all cases where two persons are accused ofa  crime and where the evidence against one is	inadmissibleagainst the other.  Their Lordships recognised that  howevercarefully  assessors  or  a jury are  directed	and  howeverfirmly	a Judge may steel his mind against being  influencedagainst	 one  by the evidence admissible  only	against	 theother,	nevertheless the mind may inadvertently be  affectedby  the	 disclosures  made  by one of  the  accused  to	 thedetriment  of the other.  Undoubtedly this  weighty  cautionhas  to be always kept in mind when Judges and juries.	haveto  deal  with such complicated cases.	But that  by  itselfwithout showing that serious(1)  (1948) 53 C.W.N. 318, 321.199prejudice  would,  in all likelihood, have occurred  in	 theparticular  case,  would  not  be  enough  to  vitiate	 theconvictions.   In this case that there has in fact been	 anysuch  prejudice	 has  not been shown  to  our  satisfaction.Indeed	the  fact  that accused No.  3,	 Jhaveri,  has	beenacquitted  by the unanimous verdict of the jury	 appears  toindicate that the jury has shown itself capable of observingthe caution given to them and making careful discrimination.In this view probably the larger question raised by  counselon  both sides as to the admissibility of the conduct  of  aco-conspirator	 outside  the  period  of   conspiracy	 andespecially of deceased co-conspirators like Lala  Shankarlaland  Doshi and a living conspirator like Mahajan who is	 noton  trial before the Court, in proof of the two main  issuesin  such a case (viz., the existence of the  conspiracy	 andthe   participation  of	 the  individual  accused  in	thatconspiracy)  may not require to be dealt with.	But as	willappear	presently the learned Judges of the High Court	haveheld  such evidence admissible and have over-ruled, on	thatground also, the contention of Mr. Chari as to the prejudicelikely	to have been caused because of their view as to	 itsadmissibility.	 Hence	it is only fair	 that  the  questionshould be considered and a conclusion arrived at.   Besides,counsel	  on  both  sides  have	 argued	 the   matter	veryelaborately  and  have	pressed us to  express	our  opinionthereupon.  It is to be noticed that the learned trial Judgeand  the High Court appear to have taken differing views  onthis  matter.	The learned Judges of the High	Court  afterelaborate discussion have definitely held that such evidenceis admissible, as shown by their conclusion on this part  ofthe case in the following terms:"  In  this manner, all the observations which	the  learnedJudge made in paragraphs 11, 73, 74, 75, 94, 101 and 388, towhich	Mr.   Chari   has  objected   on   the	 ground	  ofinadmissibility, would be relevant to show that there was  aconspiracy in this case and that Lala Shankarlal was a partyto it."That  the  learned  trial Judge appears to  have  taken	 theopposite view is reasonably clear from his ruling200(interlocutory	judgment  No.  6)  dated  August  22,  1955,already	 referred to, relating to the admissibility  of	 thedocument, Ex.  Z-71, in the committal court.  In that  orderhe sets out the arguments of both sides as follows:" It is common ground that the action of any of the  accusedperson subsequent to the period of conspiracy is  admissiblein  evidence  against that particular accused  person  only.Mr. Khandalawala, therefore, argues that the actions of LalaShankarlal, of Doshi and of Mahajan subsequent to the periodof conspiracy are admissible in evidence to prove that	theywere  party  to the conspiracy alleged in the  case  and  toprove  their  guilt  individually  along  with	the  accusedpersons	  He  further  submits	that s.	 10  of	 the  IndianEvidence Act is permissive and not an exception as contendedby  Mr.	 Chari	He says that he does not want  to  lead	 anyevidence  of the statements and actions of  Lala  Shankarlalagainst	 these accused persons, but he wants them  in  orderthat  he may prove before the jury that Lala Shankarlal	 wasalso  one  of  the conspirators	 with  the  accused  personsChari's submission is that no evidence in this case could beadmitted which is not admissible against the accused personsHe submits that the question whether Shankarlal (or Doshi orMahajan)  was  guilty of the offence of	 conspiracy  or	 notcannot arise in this trial.  Proof of conspiracy, apart fromthe  accused persons, is irrelevant.  He submits that  what-ever  Shankarlal  did  during the period  of  conspiracy  isbinding	 on  these  accused persons and	 the  Court  has  todetermine  (with reference to that evidence) whether  anyoneof  these accused persons was a conspirator with  Shankarlalor with Mahajan or with Doshi.	All the evidence that  couldbe led in a trial must be against accused persons and no oneelse.	He,  therefore, submits that the  evidence  that  issought	to  be	led by the prosecution	is  inadmissible  inevidence."Having thus set out the arguments of both sides, the learnedtrial Judge stated his conclusion as follows:"I think that the evidence in a criminal trial that could beled must be admissible against the accused(1)  (1948) 53 C.W.N. 318, 321,201persons	 only  and, therefore, the evidence of	actions	 andstatements of another person, apart from the question of  itbeing  of  the	agent of the  accused,	is  not	 admissible.Section	 10 (of the Evidence Act) as explained by the  PrivyCouncil in Mirza Akbar v. The King-Emperor (1), clearly laysdown  that the statements and actions of the  co-conspiratorwould only be evidence against the accused persons, providedthey	   are	     within	  the	    period	  ofconspiracy.....................	 I do not think,  therefore,that Lala Shankarlal or Mahajan or Doshi are accused personsbefore	me and, therefore, the subsequent conduct  of  thesepersons	 beyond the period of conspiracy unconnected by	 anyauthority from the accused persons is not admissible."     It is necessary, therefore, to appreciate clearly	whatexactly	 the  Privy Council in Mirza Akbar's  case  (1)	 hasdecided	 and  whether the learned trial Judge was  right  incoming	to  the conclusion he did on the authority  of	thatdecision.   In	the said case their Lordships of  the  PrivyCouncil	  elucidated  the  principle  of  admissibility	  ofevidence in cases of conspiracy by reference to the  Englishleading case of The Queen v. Blake (2 ). That was a case  inwhich two persons, T. and B., were charged for conspiracy tocause  certain	imported goods to be carried away  from	 theport  of London and delivered to the owners without  paymentof the full customs duty payable thereon.  T. did not appearand  defend.   B. pleaded not guilty.  At the trial  it	 wasproved	that T. was agent for the importer of the goods,  B.was a landing waiter at the Custom House.  It was T.'s	dutyto  make an entry describing the quantity etc. of goods.   Acopy  of such entry was delivered to B. who was	 to  comparethis  copy  with the goods, and, if  they  corresponded,  towrite  'correct' on T.'s entry, whereupon T.  would  receivethe goods on payment of the duty according to his entry.  Itwas  proved that T.'s entry was marked 'correct' by  B.	 andcorresponded  with  B.'s  copy and  that  payment  was	madeaccording  to  the quantity there described,  and  that	 thegoods were delivered to T. Evidence was then offered of an(1)  (1940)L.R.671.A.336.  (2) (1844) 6 Q.B. 126;  115	E.R.49.26202entry  by T. in his day book, of the charge made by  him  onthe importer, showing that T. charged as for duty paid on  alarger	quantity than appeared by the entry and copy  beforementioned.    It  was  held  that  all	this  evidence	 wasadmissible  against  B.	 But the question arose	 as  to	 theadmissibility of a further item of evidence.  It was  provedthat B. received the proceeds of a cheque drawn by T.  afterthe  goods were passed.	 The counterfoil of this cheque	 wasoffered	 in evidence, on which an account was written by  T.showing,  as  was suggested, that the cheque was  drawn	 forhalf the aggregate proceeds of several transactions, one  ofwhich corresponded in amount with the difference between theduty  paid and the duty really due on the above	 goods.	  Itwas ruled that item was not evidence against B. Referring tothis  case  their Lordships of the Privy Council  stated  asfollows in Mirza Akbar's case (1) :       "The  English  rule on this matter (i.e., as  to	 theadmissibility  of  evidence relating to a  charge  of  cons-piracy)	 is, in general, well settled.	It is a	 common	 lawrule  not based on, or limited by, express statutory  words.The  leading  case of R. v. Blake (2)  illustrates  the	 twoaspects	 of  it, because that authority shows both  what  isadmissible  and what is inadmissible.  What, in	 that  case,was  held to be admissible against the conspirator  was	 theevidence of entries made by his fellow conspirator containedin  various  documents actually used for  carrying  out	 thefraud.	But a document not created in the course of carryingout  the  transaction, but made by one of  the	conspiratorsafter  the fraud was completed, was held to be	inadmissibleagainst	 the  other............ It had nothing	to  do	withcarrying the conspiracy into effect."Their Lordships in that case also referred with approval  totwo cases of the Indian High Courts, viz., Emperor v.  AbaniBhushan	  Chuckerbutty	 (3)   and   Emperor   v.   G.	  V.Vaishampayana(4).   In the case in Emperor v. Abani  BhushanChuckerbutty  (3), one of the documents sought to be put  inevidence is a statement(1)  (1940) L. R. 67 I.A. 336.(2)  (1844) 6 Q.B. 126; 115 E.R. 49.(3)  (1910) I.L.R. 38 Cal. 169.(4)  (1931) I.L.R. 55 Bom. 839.203of  one of the co-conspirators, Abani, before  a  Magistrateafter  he  was arrested.  In that  statement  he  implicatedhimself	 and  a large number of persons in  the	 conspiracy.The  question  that arose was how far it could	be  used  asevidence  of the conspiracy and of the fact that the  otherswere co-conspirators.  Their Lordships held as follows:    "We	 have come to the conclusion that the  statement  ofAbani  cannot properly be treated as evidence under  section10  of	the  Evidence Act.  That section, in  our  view,  isintended  to make evidence communications between  differentconspirators,  while  the  conspiracy  is  going  on,	withreference to the carrying out of the conspiracy."      It may be added that this statement was merely treatedas  a confessional statement failing within the scope of  s.30  of the Evidence Act and usable only as such against	 theco-accused.  The case in Emperor v. G. V. Vaishampayana	 (1)was  also a case of conspiracy in which an approver  as	 co-conspirator gave evidence.  He gave evidence of	 statements,made  to him by another co-conspirator by name Swamirao	 whowas not an accused before the Court, which had reference  tothe  alleged  attack on the Lamington  Road  police  stationwhich  was the object of the conspiracy.   These  statementswere  alleged  to  have been made after the  return  of	 theattacking party to the approver at his residence.  Objectionwas taken to the admissibility of such statements made afterthe completion of the attack as evidence under s. 10 of	 theEvidence Act.  This objection was upheld on the ground	thatsuch  statements  made after the completion  of	 the  attackcould  not be said to have been made "in reference to  theircommon	intention  ".  It  was pointed	out  that  the	word'intention' implies that the act intended is in the  future.It  is	noteworthy that in this case  the  statements  underconsideration  were made by a coconspirator who was  not  anaccused	 at  the  trial and it was not	suggested  that	 hisevidence  would	 be  admissible	 on  the  ground  that	suchstatement  would be admissible against himself to show	thathe was a(1)  (1931) I.L.R. 55 Bom. 839.204co-conspirator	with the accused on trial and that it  wouldbecome relevant on that basis, an argument of the kind whichappears to have found favour with the learned Judges of	 theHigh  Court  in this case, as will be  presently  seen.	  InMirza Akbar's case(1) itself the question at issue was aboutthe admissibility on the charge of conspiracy of a statementmade by one of the co-conspirators before a Magistrate afterarrest.	 That was held to be not admissible.     The point to be noticed in all these cases is that	 thestatements  which have been ruled out as inadmissible  undersection	 10 of the Evidence Act were not sought to  be	madeadmissible under some other section of the Evidence Act.  Itis  further  to be noticed that in the leading case  of	 TheQueen v. Blake (2), the question of admissibility was  dealtwith  as  being one under the general law and yet  the	onlycriterion of admissibility was that which was special to thecases  of  conspiracy.	There was no  suggestion  that	suchevidence  could	 be brought in under any other	category  ofadmissibility  of evidence.  It was ruled in that case	thatthe statement in question was totally inadmissible to  proveconspiracy.  It appears, therefore, that Mirza Akbar's	case(1)  is a clear authority for the position that in  criminaltrials,	 on a charge of conspiracy evidence  not  admissibleunder  s. 10 of the Evidence Act as proof of the two  issuesto  which it relates, viz., of the existence  of  conspiracyand  of the fact of any particular person being a  party  tothat  conspiracy,  is  not admissible at  all.	 But  it  isnecessary  to appreciate clearly that what is sought  to  beadmitted  in  such a case is, something said,  or  done,  orwritten	 by any one of the co-conspirators behind the  backsof the others as being in law attributable to the others andwhat is sought to be proved by such evidence taken by itselfis  the existence of the conspiracy as between	the  allegedconspirators  and  the fact that a particular person  was  aparty  to  the	conspiracy.  It is  such  evidence  that  isinadmissible otherwise than under s. 10 of the Evidence Act.Quite  clearly, in the normal class of cases, such  evidenceis admissible as against himself and not against others,(1) (1940) L.R. 67 I.A. 336.(2) (1844) 6 Q.B. 126; 115 E.R, 49,205excepting   where  there  is  relationship  of	 agency	  orrepresentative	character or joint interest. (See s.  18  ofthe Evidence Act).  In civil cases it is well settled that aprincipal  is bound by the acts of his agent if	 the  latterhas an express or implied authority from the former and	 theacts are within the scope of his authority.  Therefore	actsof  an	agent  are admissible in  evidence  as	against	 theprincipal.  An analogous principle is recognised in criminalmatters in so far as it can be brought in under s. 10 of theEvidence   Act.	  It  is  recognised  on  well	 establishedauthority  that	 the principle underlying the  reception  ofevidence under s. 10 of the Evidence Act of the	 statements,acts and writings of one co-conspirator as against the otheris oil the theory of agency.  This is recognised in  Emperorv.  Shafi  Ahmed  (1)  and also in Emperor  v.	G.  V.	Vai-shampayana  (2),  the  case  already  mentioned	 above	 andreferred  to  with approval by the Privy  Council  in  MirzaAkbar's	 case  (3).   In Roscoe's  Criminal  Evidence  (16thEdition),  at p. 482 bottom, when dealing with the  evidencerelating to criminal conspiracy, it is stated as follows:       "  An overt act committed by any one of	the  conspi-rators	is sufficient, on the general principles of  agency,to make it the act of all."      Now  both the English rule as recognised in The  Queenv.  Blake (4) as well as the rule in s. 10 of  the  EvidenceAct, confine that principle of agency in criminal matters tothe  acts  of the co-conspirator within	 the  period  duringwhich  it  can be said that the acts were "in  reference  totheir  common  intention " that is to say, as  held  by	 thePrivy  Council in Mirza Akbar's case (3) "things said,	doneor  written,  while the conspiracy was on foot "  and  "  incarrying   out	the  conspiracy."  The	Privy  Council	 hasexplained the basic principle in the following terms:"  Where  the  evidence	 is  admissible	 it  is,  in   theirLordships'  judgment, on the principle that the thing  done,written or spoken, was something done in(1)  (1925) 31 Bom.  L.R. 515, 519.(2)  (1931) I.L.R, 55 Bom. 839.(3)  (1940) L.R. 67 I.A. 336.(4) (1844) 6 Q. B. 126; 115 E.R. 49.206carrying out the conspiracy, and was receivable as a step inthe proof of the conspiracy."	It appears, therefore, that the learned trial  Judgewas right in his view that the admissibility of evidence  ofthe  kind which is now under consideration is ruled  out  onthe  authority of Mirza Akbar's case(1).  The argument thatsuch  evidence	even if it is of the conduct of	 a  deceasedconspirator, is admissible under s. 8 of the Evidence Act asbeing evidence of conduct on a relevant issue, would  appearto  be untenable on the very terms of s. 8, apart  from	 theauthority  of  Mirza Akbar's case (1).	Section 8  in  termssays as follows:     " The conduct of any person, an offence against whom isthe subject of any proceeding, is relevant, if such  conductinfluences or is influenced by any fact in issue or relevantfact.  "   This	 appears  clearly to rule out the  conduct  of	LalaShankarlal,  Doshi, and Mahajan behind the backs of  others,as  inadmissible.  Such conduct would be admissible only  tothe  extent  that  it  is permissible under  s.	 10  of	 theEvidence  Act,	if  it is the conduct  of  a  co-conspiratorwhether he is alive or dead and whether on trial before	 thecourt  or  not.	 Mr. Khandalawala in his  arguments  againstthis view has suggested some hypothetical cases to show	 thedifficulties  that  may arise on such a view.  But  a  closeconsideration of these suggested hypothetical cases does notshow  that  they  raise any  serious  difficulties.   It  isunnecessary to notice them at any length.     The  learned Judges of the High Court (in	reliance  oncertain English decisions which, with respect, do not appearto have any direct bearing on the question at issue) were ofthe  opinion  that since a person's  conduct  is  admissibleagainst	 himself  without the limitations of s.	 10  of	 theEvidence  Act,	the  conduct of	 Lala  Shankarlal  would  beadmissible  to show that there was a conspiracy and that  hewas  a	conspirator in it. it appears, with  great  respect,that  this reasoning is fallacious.  The admission  of	suchevidence, in proof of conspiracy or of the fact that he	 wasa co-conspirator, is, in its essence,(1)  (1940) L.R. 67 I.A. 336.207admission  not as against himself but as against the  otherswho  are on trial.  To the extent that such an issue,  i.e.,of  there  being  a  conspiracy	 and  of  his  being  a	 co-conspirator,  is  relevant at the trial, it must  be  provedonly  by evidence under s. 10 of the Evidence Act, which  isan  exceptional	 section  limited  in  its  application	  toconspiracies to commit an offence or to commit an actionablewrong.	 The learned Judges have also failed to notice	thatthe  evidence  of  conduct  admissible under  s.  8  of	 theEvidence Act is of conduct of a person who is a party to theaction.	 It is thus reasonably clear that evidence of  acts,statements  or	writings of a  co-conspirator  either  undertrial or not on trial but outside the period of	 conspiracy,would  not be admissible in proof of the specific  issue  ofthe  existence	of the conspiracy.  It is necessary  to	 addthat my learned brothers prefer to reserve their opinion  onthis legal question on the ground that it does not call	 fordecision in this case.      In  any  case and as already explained above,  in	 theearlier	 portion  of  this  judgment,  it  may	happen	withreference  to the facts of a particular case, that  evidencewould  be admissible of various facts outside the period  ofconspiracy, if they are relevant on any substantial issue inthe case, as for instance (in this case) the bogus characterof  the loans and the criminal intention of each  individualaccused.  In respect of such issues, the statement, act	 andwriting	 of an individual co-conspirator outside the  periodof  conspiracy may be nothing more than a link in the  chainof  evidence  relating	to  such  matters  or  prefatory  orexplanatory matter within reasonable limits.  It would	thenbe admissible in that context but not as affecting the otherco-conspirators	 by  its  being	 treated  as  their  act  orstatement  on  the  theory of agency  (though  behind  theirback).	It has also been seen above that in the present caseevidence,  if any, of the acts, statements and	writings  ofLala  Shankarlal and other co-conspirators was	admitted  bythe learned trial Judge only on that footing.  Therefore thecontention of Mr. Chari for the appellants that a good	dealof  inadmissible  evidence  has	 been  let  in,	 cannot	  besustained.208The  next point that is urged is that a number of  documentsput  in evidence which are said to be in the handwriting  ofone  or	 other	of the accused were sent  to  a	 handwritingexpert for his opinion and that the expert was not called asa  witness  on	the prosecution side,  nor  was	 his  reportexhibited,   but   the	jury  was  asked  to   compare	 thehandwritings  in  the disputed documents with  the  admittedhandwritings and to form their own conclusions.	 It is urgedthat this was not fair and that the prosecution was bound toexamine	 the handwriting expert and exhibit his report.	  Itis  well  settled, however, that the Court  cannot  normallycompel	the prosecution to examine a witness which  it	doesnot chose to and that the duty of a fair prosecutor  extendsonly to examine such of the witnesses who are necessary	 forthe  purpose  of  unfolding the	 prosecution  story  in	 itsessentials.  (See Habeeb Mohamed v. The State  of  Hyderabad(1) ). Mr. Khandalawala appearing for the prosecution statesthat  the examination of the handwriting expert was  not  inany   sense  necessary	in  this  case	for  unfolding	 theprosecution  case  and we are inclined to  agree  with	him.Even  if a different view is to be taken as to the  duty  ofthe Prosecution, to examine such a witness, all that can  besaid normally in such a case is that the defence is entitledto  comment upon it and to ask the jury to draw	 an  adverseinference  in respect of that portion of the case  to  whichthe  evidence  of  the	handwriting  expert  relates.	 Mr.Khandalawala  for  the prosecution points out that  in	factthis has been done by Mr. Chari when addressing the jury forthe defence.  He states also that he himself in his  addresstold  the  jury	 that it was open to them  to  do  so.	 Mr.Chari's	 grievance  however  is that the Court	has  not  interms, directed the jury to this effect in its charge to thejury.	That no doubt appears to be so.	 But in a case	likethis  dealing  with so many details-, we see  no  reason  tothink  that  this omission of the learned trial	 Judge,	 waslikely in this case, to have caused any serious prejudice inthe circumstances above stated.(1)  (1954) S.C.R. 475, 489, 490.209There  is  next	 a similar point sought to be  made  out  inrespect	 of  the  non-examination of  three  persons,  viz.,Chandulal Ratanchand Shah, Himatlal F. Parikh, and  HimatlalHarilal	  Shah.	  It  is  pointed  out	that   shares	weredistributed  to	 these	three persons also  along  with	 thedistribution  of shares to the various conspirators.  It  issuggested that if they were examined as witnesses they wouldhave  been  able  to show the  circumstances  in  which	 thedistribution of the shares had been made and this would haveenabled the accused to show that such distribution was inno-cent   and  not	 by  way  of  dishonest	 gain.	  The	sameconsiderations	as with reference to the non-examination  ofthe handwriting expert apply also to the non-examination  ofthese  three  persons.	It has also been pointed out  to  usthat  these transfers of shares to these three persons	tookplace  before the amendment of s. 6A of the  Insurance	Act,1938  (IV  of  1938),  and  that  consequently	their	non-examination   would  not  have	resulted  in   any   seriousprejudice.   However that may be, we are unable to find	 anyadequate  reason  to  think that the trial  is	in  any	 wayvitiated by the non-examination of these witnesses or of thehandwriting expert.     The  next	argument  advanced  by	Mr.  Chari  for	 theappellants  is that the prosecution was enabled to  ask	 thejury   to  convict  the	 accused  on  a	  consideration	  ofprosecution  evidence tending to prove alternative  sets  offacts  in relation to one of the important questions in	 thecase and that this is not permissible in law.  This argumenthas  a	bearing	 both on the general case  against  all	 theaccused	 and also on the case against  appellant  Caveeshar.It has reference to the following portion of the prosecutioncase.  It is to be recalled that the original loan of Rs. 25lakhs and odd from the funds of the Jupiter to Caveeshar  onthe  alleged  security of his supposed properties  in  Delhiwas,  according	 to  the  prosecution  case,  sought  to  besupported by the conspirators by certain appearances,  viz.,an application for such a loan, a valuation statement of thealleged	 properties and other necessary papers and  also  bycertain resolutions Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the27210directorate of the Jupiter at its meeting dated January	 11,1949,  sanctioning  such loan on the basis of  such  papers.The  prosecution  case appears to be that as  a	 fact  thesepapers	were non-existent and the resolutions Nos. 5,  6,  7and  8 were not in fact passed, on the date when,  accordingto  the present appearances in the minutes book, the  matterwas taken up for consideration by the Board of directors  atits meeting of January 11, 1949.  For this purpose they relyamongst other things on the evidence of one Subramaniam, thesecretary  of the directorate, whose duty generally  was  toattend all meetings and to keep a note of the minutes of thebusiness  done	at each meeting.  The  prosecution  evidenceappears also to be that the necessary papers and resolutionswere  brought into existence on a later date and  ante-datedand  interpolated.  With reference to this case of the	pro-secution the learned trial Judge in para. 545 of his  chargeto the jury stated as follows:     " The question whether the resolutions Nos. 5, 6, 7 and8  were passed or not (on January 11, 1949) is an  importantquestion  to  consider	so far	as  the	 criminal  intentionalleged	 on the part of the accused Nos. 1, 2, 3 and  4	 areconcerned.   In	 this  case what you  have  to	consider  iswhether	 you  are  prepared  to	 believe  the  evidence	  ofSubramaniam  or not that no such resolutions were passed  atthe  said meeting.  If you disbelieve his evidence  on	thispoint, then consider whether apart from his evidence,  thereis  sufficient	evidence  on  record  to  lead	you  to	 theconclusion  that  no such resolutions were passed.   If	 youcome  to  the conclusion that there is no  other  convincingevidence to show that the resolutions were not passed,	thenyou will come to the conclusion that they were passed in thesaid  meeting  as it was in the minutes.  In that  case	 theresolutions having been passed, you have to consider whetherthe accused bona fide believed that they were authorized  todeal  with  the funds of the company and pay the  amount  ofTropical Insurance Co. on behalf of Caveeshar."     We do not see anything in this portion of the charge tothe jury to justify the contention that the prosecution211was permitted to rely on alternative sets of facts.  It	 wascertainly  open	 to the prosecution to rely in a  matter  ofthis  kind,  both on direct evidence and  on  circumstantialevidence and to maintain that even if the direct evidence ofSubramaniam  is not acceptable, the circumstantial  evidenceis  enough for the proof of its version.   The	alternativeswhich  the learned trial Judge in his charge to the jury  asextracted  above  referred to were, in the  first  instance,alternatives which arose on the reliance of the	 prosecutionboth  on the direct and on the circumstantial evidence,	 andthen  the  alternatives	 which arose  for  consideration  infavour of the accused if both the direct and  circumstantialevidence   of  the  prosecution	 in  this  behalf  are	 notacceptable.  The alternatives presented for the	 prosecutionare  not in any sense the presentation of  any	inconsistentcases.	 Doubtless tile prosecution cannot be  permitted  tolead evidence relating to inconsistent cases.  But so far aswe  have  been able to apprehend that is not what  has	beendone  in  this case.  We are, therefore, unable to  see	 anysubstance  in  this contention.	 It may be noticed  in	thiscontext	 that  none  of the documents  connected  with	thisCaveeshar  transaction are now available.  Indeed  that	 wasthe position also even by the time when the-auditors  wantedto  see those documents in the year 1950 the explanation  ofthe  directors	at the time being that since  that  loan  toCaveeshar was discharged by him by complete payment all	 therelevant documents had been returned to him.  Of course, thecase of Caveeshar himself is that he was not a party to	 thealleged loan and that he was not aware of any such documentsand that the manipulations, if any, were behind his back.    Mr. Chari next complains about what he says is a seriousmis-direction  to  the jury inasmuch as	 the  learned  Judgeasked  the  jury  to ignore the fact that by  the  time	 thecomplaint  was filed in 1951, the money allegedly taken	 outof the Jupiter by means of the two impugned transactions  ofJanuary	 20,  1949, had been put back in cash and  that	 theauditors  themselves were ultimately satisfied about it	 andthat the shareholders at their general meeting in 1950	alsoaccepted212Lala Shankarlal's explanation in respect thereof.  But we donot  think  that,  in view of the  evidence  given  for	 theprosecution  in the case to the effect that  this  situationwas  hurriedly brought about in the month of October,  1950,by  utilizing  the  securities of  the	Jupiter	 itself	 forpurchasing the controlling block of shares of the Empire  ofIndia  and by getting money out of the Empire of  India,  itwould  have been fair to the prosecution to direct the	juryto  take  the  apparent return back of	the  moneys  of	 theJupiter shown as given on the various investments, as a trueindication  of	the  alleged  misappropriation	having	beenproved	to  be	merely an  unwarranted	suspicion.   In	 thecircumstances, the learned Judge appears to have been  rightin  directing  the jury to ignore that portion of  the	caseeither for or against the accused.    The	 next argument which requires notice is	 about	whatare   said  to	be  certain  irrational	 features   of	 theprosecution  case.   It would appear that in  the  argumentsaddressed  by the defence counsel to the jury in  the  trialcourt  a  number of circumstances relating  to	the  variousalleged	 manipulations have been pointed out which,  on	 theassumption  that the accused were parties to the  conspiracyas  charged,  could  only  be  characterised  as  irrationalconduct	  of  the  various  accused  concerned	 and   whichcircumstances,	it was urged, must therefore be taken to  beprima  facie  in their favour as supporting  their  defence,viz.,  that they had no knowledge of the criminality of	 thetransactions  which  might have actuated the  mind  of	LalaShankarlal,  but  that so far as they  were  concerned	theyacted in perfect good faith.  The complaint of Mr. Chari forthe  defence,  both in the High Court and here is  that	 thelearned	 trial Judge has not adequately dealt with  them  inhis  charge  to the jury and that the appellants  have	beenprejudiced thereby.  The learned trial Judge has dealt	withthis  aspect  of the case in para 556 of his charge  to	 thejury and the learned Judges of the High Court have  somewhatmore  elaborately dealt with this at pp. 159 to 162  of	 thetyped paper-book containing the judgment of the High  Court.Mr. Khandalawala appearing for the prosecution points out tous that these213alleged	 irrational  features have been dealt  with  by	 thelearned trial Judge in his charge to the jury then and therewith  reference to each particular item of evidence when  ithad  to	 be  referred  to in  the  context  of	the  generalnarrative  or  the  narrative  as  against  each  individualaccused.   All	that can be said is that the  learned  trialJudge has not once again repeated the same when drawing	 theattention  of  the  jury to this specific  argument  of	 Mr.Chari, who appears to have stressed them in a general  sweepby  clubbing  these  together  as  being  thirty  irrationalfeatures.   We	agree with the High Court that there  is  noreason	to think that the somewhat summary way in which	 thelearned	 trial	Judge  dealt with this in para	556  of	 hischarge	to  the	 jury  can be  taken  exception	 to  in	 thecircumstances  of  the	case  as  being	 any  material	non-direction.      A special argument has been advanced on behalf of	 theappellant  Caveeshar  that  he was not	a  director  of	 theJupiter	 and was not present at any of the meetings  of	 theconspirators  as  directors  of the  Jupiter  and  that	 theevidence against him was more or less on the same footing asthat against Jhaveri, accused 3, who has been acquitted,  atleast  in so far as it relates to the period  of  conspiracyand  that his case has been affected by the prejudice  whichmay  have  been engendered in the minds of the jury  by	 theevidence relating to the acts of Lala Shankarlal beyond	 theperiod of conspiracy.  On behalf of the prosecution we	havebeen  shown by Mr. Khandalawala enough	admissible  evidenceagainst	 him  which,  if the jury choose  to  accept,  couldreasonably be the basis for conviction.Having	given  our best consideration to all  the  argumentsaddressed on both the sides, we have come to the  conclusionthat  there  is	 no sufficient reason  for  interference  inspecial leave with the convictions, based on the  acceptanceby  the	 trial Judge of the verdict of the  jury.   All	 theappeals are accordingly dismissed.Appeals dismissed.214
