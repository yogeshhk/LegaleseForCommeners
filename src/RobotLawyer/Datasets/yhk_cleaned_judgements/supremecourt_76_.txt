The appellants challenged the	 acquisitionproceedings  under  Art.  226 of  the  Constitution  on	 theground,	 inter alia, that the procedure prescribed  by	PartVII  of the said Act had not been admittedly complied  with.The  Division  Bench  in affirming the	order  of  dismissalpassed by the trial judge held that although Art. 31 of	 theConstitution   by  prohibiting	compulsory  acquisition	  ofproperty  except for a public purpose had made Part  VII  ofthe Act redundant, the present proceedings were saved  sincethe acquisition was for a public purpose.Held,  that the High Court was in error in holding that	 theConstitution  had rendered Part VII of the Land	 AcquisitionAct, 1894, redundant or null and void, although it was rightin dismissing the appeal.  That Act, as an existing Act, wassaved by Art. 31(5)(a) from being affected by Art. 31(2)  ofthe Constitution.Acquisition  of	 building sites for residential	 houses	 forindustrial labour is for a public purpose even apart from s.17(2)460(b)of  the Act as amended by ':the Land Acquisition  (PunjabAmendment) Act of 1953.Babu  Barkava Thakur v. The State of Bombay [1961] 1  S.C.R.128, referred to.Although  in  the  case	 of an	acquisition  for  a  companysimpliciter,  no  declaration under s. 6 of the Act  can  bemade  without complying with the provisions of Part  VII  ofthe Act, it is not correct to say that no acquisition for  acompany	 for a public purpose can be made except under	PartVII  of	 the Act.  If the cost of the acquisition  is  borneeither	wholly or partially by the Government,	the  purposewould  be  a public purpose within the meaning of  the	Act.But if the cost is entirely borne by the company it would bean  acquisition	 for the company simpliciter  and  Part	 VIIwould apply.Since in the instant case a part of the compensation was  tobe  borne by the Government, it was not necessary to  complywith the provisions of Part VII of the Act.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 4 of 1960.Appeal	by special leave from the Judgment and	Order  datedJanuary 28, 1959 of the Punjab High Court in Letters  PatentAppeal No. 52 of 1958 arising out of the Judgment and  Orderdated February 17, 1958 of the said High Court in Civil WritApplication No. 124 of 1957.C.

November 16.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbySINHA,	C.  J.-This appeal, by special leave granted on	 May29,  1959, is directed against the decision of	the  LettersPatent	Bench  (G.  D. Khosla, C. J., and Dulat,  J.)  datedJanuary 28, 1959, affirming that of the learned single Judge(Bishan	 Narain,  J.) dated February 17,  1958,	 whereby  hedismissed the461appellants'   Writ   Petition	under  Art.   226   of	 theConstitution.It  appears that the appellants are the owners of,  what  issaid  to  be, agricultural land, measuring about  86  bighasodd,  in  village  Munda Majra,	 Tehsil	 Jagadhari,  in	 thedistrict  of  Ambala.  On October 27, 1954,  the  AdditionalDistrict Magistrate of Ambala ordered the land aforesaid  tobe   requisitioned   under  the	 Punjab	  Requisitioning   &Acquisition of Immoveable Property Act (XI of 1953) for	 theconstruction  of houses by members of the Thapar  IndustriesCo-operative Housing Society Ltd., Yamuna Nagar.  Possessionof the land was taken on November 5, 1954.  The	 appellants,at  once,  instituted a suit on November 14,  1954,  in	 theCourt  of the Subordinate Judge, Jagadhari, challenging	 therequisition proceedings.  The suit was ultimately decreed bythe  Court  on	June 21, 1955, and  the	 possession  of	 theproperty  in question was restored to the  petitioners.	  OnMay  27,  1955, the first respondent, i. e.,  the  State  ofPunjab,	 through the Secretary, Labour Department, issued  anotification  under s. 4 of the Land Acquisition Act  (1  of1894)  (which hereinafter will be referred to as  the  Act).The notification, under s. 4 is in these terms."No. 4850-S-LP-55/14144.  Whereas it appears to the Governorof  Punjab that land in the locality hereunder specified  islikely to be needed by the Government for a public  purpose,namely,	 for the construction of a Labour Colony  under	 theGovernment  sponsored  Housing	Scheme	for  the  IndustrialWorkers	 of  the  Thapar  Industrial  Workers'	Co-operativeHousing	 Society Limited, Jamna Nagar (District Ambala),  itis  hereby notified that the land described in the  specifi-cations	 below	is  likely  to be  required  for  the  abovepurpose.This notification is made under the provisions of Section  4read  with section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894,  asamended	 by  the Land Acquisition  (Punjab  Amendment)	Act,1953, to all to whom it may concern and the Collector  shallcause public notice of the substance of this notification tobe given at convenient places in the said locality;462In  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  the  aforesaidsections, the Governor of the Punjab is pleased to authorisethe President of the above said Society with the members andservants  to enter upon and survey any land in the  localityand do all other acts required or permitted by that section.Further	 in exercise of the powers conferred by	 sub-section(4) of Section 17 of the said Act the Governor of Punjab  ispleased	 to  direct  that, on the grounds  of  urgency,	 theprovisions of Section 5(a) of the said Act, shall not  applyin regard to this Acquisition".Later, the same day, another notification, under s. 6 of theAct, was issued.  This notification, under s. 6, states thatit  appeared  to  the Governor of Punjab that  the  land  isrequired  to  be taken by Government for a  public  purpose,namely,	 for the construction of a Labour Colony  under	 theGovernment  sponsored  Housing Scheme  for  the'  IndustrialWorkers	 of  the  Thapar  Industrial  Workers'	Co-operativeHousing	 Society Limited (which is the second respondent  inthis case).  It also says that under the provisions of s.  7of the Act, the Collector, Ambala, is directed to take orderfor  the  acquisition  of the land.   The  Patwari  effecteddelivery  of  possession  of the lands in  question  to	 thesecond	respondent  on	August 21, 1955.   Even	 before	 thedelivery  of  possession had been effected,  the  appellantspromptly  instituted their suit on August 20, 1955,  in	 theCourt  of  the Subordinate Judge Class 1, Jagadhari,  for  aperpetual injunction restraining the second respondent	fromentering upon or taking possession of the land in  question,or  making  any	 construction  thereon.	  The  trial   Courtdismissed  the	suit on June 25, 1956,	on  the	 preliminaryground	that the suit was not competent in the absence of  aprevious  notice  under	 s. 59 of  the	Punjab	Co-operativeSocieties Act, 1955 (XIV of 1955).  The appellants  appealedto the Senior Sub-Judge, Ambala, who dismissed their appeal,upholding  the decision of the trial Court that	 the  noticewas  a condition precedent to the institution of  the  suit.Their  second appeal was dismissed by the Punjab High  Courton  February  6,1957.	During the  pendency  of  the  civillitigation  aforesaid, in spite of the fact that the  secondrespondent had463obtained  delivery of possession through Government  agency,by an Order of Injunction issued by the Court,	constructionhad been stayed.  As soon as the High Court decided the suitin favour of the respondents, the second respondent "startedmaking	huge constructions on the land in dispute in a	veryspeedy	manner",  as  alleged by  the  appellants  in  theirpetition  under	 Art. 226 of the  Constitution,	 which	theyfiled on February 13, 1957.  From the High Court also,	theyobtained  similar  Stay Orders whereby	building  operationswere  stopped.	In their Writ Petition, the  appellants,  aspetitioners  in the High Court, challenged  the	 acquisitionproceedings  on	 a number of grounds, of which	it  is	onlynecessary  to  notice the one which has formed	the  subjectmatter	of  decision  in the High Court,  namely,  that	 theproceedings  were  void	 for want  of  compliance  with	 theprocedure laid down in Chapter VII (mistake for Part VII) ofthe  Act.   It	is  not necessary  to  refer  to  the  othercontentions  raised  in	 the Writ Petition,  because  it  iscommon	ground before us that the whole controversy must  bedetermined  by the answer to the question, 'whether  or	 notthe proceedings were vitiated by reason of the admitted factthat no proceedings under Part VII of the Act had been takenin making the acquisition'.The  matter  was  heard, in the first  instance,  by  BishanNarain, J. The learned Judge dismissed the petition, holdingthat  the  acquisition was by the Government  for  a  publicpurpose, namely, of construction of tenements for industrialworkers, under a schempeal   against the order to the Collector of the district or such   other officer as may, by notification, be authorised in   this behalf by the State Government.   629    Section 6 imposes a restriction on the transport of   agricultural cattle for slaughter and reads:    "S. 6. No person shall transport or offer for trans   port or cause to be transported any agricultural cattle   from any place within the State to any place outside   the State, for the purpose of its slaughter in contra.   vention of the provisions of this Act or with the   knowledge that it will be or is likely to be, so slaugh-   tered."    Section 7 prohibits the sale, purchase or disposal   otherwise of certain kinds of animals.  It reads-.    "S. 7. No person shall purchase, sell or otherwise   dispose of or offer to purchase, sell or otherwise dis-   pose of or cause to be purchased, sold or otherwise   disposed of cows, calves of cows or calves of she-   buffaloes for slaughter or knowing or having reason   to believe that such cattle shall be slaughtered."    Section 8 relates to possession of flesh of agricultu-   ral cattle and is in these terms:    "S. 8. Notwithstanding anything contained in   any other law for the time being in force, no person   shall have in his possession flesh of any agricultural   cattle slaughtered in contravention of the provisions   of this Act."    Section 10 imposes apenalty for a contravention of   s. 4(l)(a) and s. 11 imposes penalty for a contraven-   tion of any of the other provisions of the Act.    On behalf of the petitioners it has been pointed out,   and rightly in our opinion, that cl. (a) of sub-s. (2) of   s. 4 of the Act imposes an unreasonable restriction on   the right of the petitioners.  That clause in its first   part lays down that the cattle (other than cows and   calves) must be over 20 years of age and must also be   unfit for work or breeding; and in the second part it   says, "or has become permanently incapacitated from   work or breeding due to age, injury, deformity or an   incurable disease." It is a little difficult to understand   why the two parts are juxtaposed in the section.  In   any view the restriction that the animal must be over   20 years of age and also unfit for work or breeding is   an excessive or unreasonable restriction as we have   80   630   pointed out with regard to a similar provision in the   Uttar Pradesh Act.  The second part of the clause   would not be open to any objection, if it stood by it-   self.  If, however, it has to be combined with the age-   limit mentioned in the first part of the clause, it will   again be open to the same objection; if the animal is   to be over 20 years of age and also permanently in-   capacitated from work or breeding etc.,then the age-   limit is really meaningless.	 Then, the expression 'due   to age' in the second part of the clause also loses its   meaning.  It seems to us that cl. (a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 4   of the Act as drafted is bad because it imposes a dis-   proportionate restriction on the slaughter of bulls,   bullocks and buffaloes it is a restriction excessive in   nature and not in the interests of the general public.   The test laid down is not merely permanent incapa-   city or unfitness for work or breeding but the test is   something more than that, a combination of age and   unfitness' Learned Counsel for the petitioners has plac-   ed before us an observation contained in a reply made   by the Deputy Minister in the course of the debate   on the Bill in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly (see   Madhya Pradesh Assembly Proceedings, Vol. 5 Serial   no. 34 dated April 14, 1959, page 3201).  He said that   the age fixed was very much higher than the one to   which any animal survived.  This observation has   been placed before us not with a view to an interpre-   tation of the section, but to show what opinion was   held by the Deputy Minister as to the proper age-   limit.  On behalf of the respondent State our atten-   tion has been drawn to a book called The Miracle of   Life (Home Library Club) in which there is a state-   ment that oxen, given good conditions, live about 40   years.  Our attention has also been drawn to certain   extracts from a Hindi book called Godhan by Girish   Chandra Chakravarti in which there are statements   to the effect that cows and bullocks may live up to 20   or 25 years.	 This is an aspect of the case with which   we have already dealt.  The question before us is not   the maximum age upto which bulls, bullocks and   buffaloes may live in rare cases.  The question before   us is what is their average longevity and at what age   631    they become useless.  On this question we think that   the opinion is almost unanimous, and the opinion   which the Deputy Minister expressed was not wrong.    Section 5 in so far as it imposes a restriction as to   the time for slaughter is again open to the same ob-   jection as has been discussed by us with regard to a   similar provision in the Uttar Pradesh Act.	A right   of appeal is given to any person aggrieved by the   order.  In other words, a member of the public, if   he feels aggrieved by the order granting a certificate   for slaughter, may prefer an appeal and hold up for   a long time the slaughter of the animal.  We have   pointed out that for all practical purposes such a   restriction will really put an end to the trade of the   petitioners and we are unable to accept a restriction   of this kind as a reasonable restriction within the   meaning of cl. (6) of Art. 19 of the Constitution.    Section 6 standing by itself, we think, is not open   to any serious objection.  It is ancillary in nature   and tries to give effect to the provision of the Act   prohibiting slaughter of cattle in contravention of the   Act.    Section 7 relates to the prohibition of sale, purchase   etc., of cows and calves and inasmuch as a total ban   on the slaughter of cows and calves is valid, no ob-   jection can be taken to s. 7 of the Act.  It merely   seeks to effectuate the total ban on the slaughter of   cows and calves (both of cows and she-buffaloes).  Sec-   tion 8 is also ancillary in character and if the other   provisions are valid no objection can be taken to the   provisions of s. 8. Sections 10 and 11 impose penal-	e subsidised by the Government out  ofpublic funds; that Part VII of the Act had no application tothe  present  proceedings, and that,  therefore,  the  noti-fication  under	 s.  6	was  not  invalid.   The  appellantspreferred an appeal, under the Letters Patent.	The  LettersPatent	Bench  dismissed  the  appeal,	but  for   differentreasons.   After  an examination of the	 precedents  of	 thedifferent  High Courts, bearing on the controversy  in	thiscase, the Bench came to the conclusion, which may better  beexpressed in its own words:-"There is thus considerable authority for the464view advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants thatcompliance with the provisions of Part VII is obligatory  inthe case of all acquisitions for a company.  In the  presentcase  the acquisition was undoubtedly for the benefit  of  acompany.    I  have  given  this  matter  my  most   anxiousconsideration,	and,  with  great  respect  to	the  learnedJudges, whose decisions have been noted above, I find myselfunable	to  subscribe to the views expressed  by  them.	  Itseems to me that their views were coloured by the backgroundof  the provisions of the Constitution.	 Article 31  of	 theConstitution  prohibits compulsory acquisition	of  propertyfor   anything	 except	 a   public   purpose.	  Therefore,acquisition  for  anything  which is not  a  public  purposecannot	now  be	 done compulsorily, but it  has	 never	beendisputed  that before the Constitution came into force	landcould  have been acquired compulsorily by Government  for  apurpose which was not public.  There is nothing in the	LandAcquisition  Act to warrant the assumption that the  embargoplaced by Article 31 of the Constitution found place in	 theAct.   It seems to me that the Land Acquisition Act  contem-plates two categories of acquisitions".After an examination of the provisions of the Act, the	HighCourt observed that the Land Acquisition Act came into forcewhen there was no bar to compulsory acquisition for  privatepurposes.  Such a bar was only imposed, for the first  time,by Art. 31 of the Constitution.	 After the Constitution cameinto force, Part VII of the Act became redundant or null andvoid.  But, in its view, the present acquisition proceedingswere saved from all attack based on non-compliance with	 theprovisions  of	Part VII of the Act.  The  reason  for	thisconclusion,  according	to the High Court, was that  as	 theland was acquired for a public purpose, there was no need tocomply	with  the provisions of Part VII,  even	 though	 theCompany is to bear all the expenses for the acquisition.It is manifest that the main point for determination in thisappeal	is: Whether or not the acquisition  proceedings	 hadbeen vitiated by reason of the admitted fact that there	 wasno attempt made by the465Government  to comply with the requirements of Part  VII  ofthe Act.  It is equally clear that the Letters Patent  Benchof the High Court was misled in its conclusions, because allthe  provisions of Art. 31 of the Constitution had not	beenbrought to their notice.  It is not correct to say that PartVII  of	 the Act had become redundant or null and  void,  assuggested by the High Court, because that Part provided	 foracquisition for a private purpose.  As held by this Court ina recent decision, in the case of Babu Barkaya Thakur v. TheState  of  Bombay  (1),	 the Act deals	with  two  kinds  ofacquisitions:  (1) for a public purpose, at the cost of	 theGovernment, and (2) for a purpose akin to such a purpose, atthe  cost  of  a  Company,  and	 to  the  latter  class	  ofacquisition,  the provisions of Part VII are attracted.	  Itwas further held in that case that acquisition of a site forbuilding  residential  houses for industrial  labour  was  apublic purpose, and that the Land Acquisition Act was immunefrom  attack  based on the provisions of Art. 31(2)  of	 theConstitution, in view of the provisions of cl. 5(a) of	thatArticle,  which saved an existing law of the nature  of	 theAct  in question.  As will presently appear, the  conclusionof  the High Court is entirely correct, but the	 process  ofreasoning  by  which  it  has  reached	that  conclusion  iserroneous.   That  process suffers from	 the  initial  errorarising	 from the fact that the provisions of Art. 31(5)  ofthe Constitution had not been brought to the notice of	thatBench.	 If  the  Bench were cognizant	of  the	 true  legalposition  that	the Land Acquisition Act, in  its  entirety,including Part VII dealing with the acquisition of Land	 forCompanies, was not subject to any attack under Art. 31(2) ofthe Constitution, it would not have based that conclusion onthat  ratio.   Otherwise, there would be no  answer  to	 thecontention in which the appellants had persisted  throughoutthe long course of litigation in which they have indulged intheir  vain effort to save the land from being used for	 thepublic purpose aforesaid.  The Letters Patent Bench has alsofallen(1)  [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128.59466into  another error in assuming that "the  compensation	 waspaid in its entirety by the Company".  It is better to clearthe  ground  by showing that this assumption  is  not  well-founded in fact.In  their  Writ Petition, as originally filed  in  the	HighCourt,	it  was not categorically stated by  the  appellantsthat the compensation in respect of the land in question waspaid,  or was to be paid, by the Company.  It may be  statedhere,  by the way, that it is common ground that the  secondrespondent is a Company within the meaning of the Act, beinga  registered society under the Co-operative Societies	Act.It is also common ground that the purpose for which the landwas being acquired was for erecting residential quarters forindustrial  labour, which had organised itself into the	 Co-operative  Housing Society, the second respondent.   It	 wasonly at a later stage of the proceedings in the High  Court,that  is to say, in the replication filed on behalf  of	 theappellants to the Written Statement filed by the Government,in  answer to the appellant's Writ Petition, that,  for	 thefirst  time,  it  was alleged by the  appellants  that	"theentire	amount	of compensation has been borne by  the	res-pondent	 society".   This  allegation has  not	been  eithersupported  or countered by evidence on either side.  But  ithas been pointed out by the learned single Judge that it wasclear from the Government Housing Scheme that a	 substantialamount	to  be	expended on this Scheme	 comes	out  of	 theRevenues, in the form of subsidies and loans.  It was statedat  the Bar, with reference to the terms and  conditions  ofthe  Government Housing Scheme, that 25% to 50% of the	costof  land and structures to be built upon the land was to  beadvanced by Government out of public funds, in the shape  ofsubsidy	 and  loan.  It would, thus, appear  that  the	HighCourt was not right in the assumption made as aforesaid.It  is clear from the statement of facts on record that	 therespondent  No. 2 is a 'Company', within the meaning of	 theAct;  that  the	 land is acquired for the.  benefit  of	 theCompany, and at its instance, and that a large proportion ofthe compensation money was to467come  out of public funds, the other portion being  suppliedby the Company or its members.	There is also no doubt	thatthe  structures	 to be made on the land	 would	benefit	 themembers	 of  the  Co-operative Society.	  But,	the  privatebenefit	 of  a large number of	industrial  workers  becomespublic	benefit within the meaning of the  Land	 AcquisitionAct.  In this connection, it may be mentioned that s. 17  ofthe  Act  was  amended	by  the	 Land  Acquisition   (PunjabAmendment) Act (11 of 1954) in these terms-"17(2)(b).   Whenever  in the opinion of  the  Collector  itbecomes necessary to acquire the immediate possession of anyland   for  the	 purpose  of  any  library  or	 educationalinstitution   or  for  the  construction,  ex.	tension	  orimprovement  of	 any  building or  other  structure  in	 anyvillage	 for  the  common use of  the  inhabitants  of	suchvillage, or any godown for any society registered under	 theCo-operative  Societies	 Act,  1912 (II	 of  1912),  or	 anydwelling-house	for the poor, or the construction of  labourcolonies under a Government-sponsored Housing Scheme, or anyirrigation  tank,  irrigation or drainage  channel,  or	 anywell, or any public road,the Collector may, immediately after the publication of	 thenotice	mentioned in sub-section (1), and with the  previoussanction  of the appropriate Government enter upon and	takepossession   of	 such  land,  which  shall  thereupon	vestabsolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances".It will appear from the (amended) s. 17(2)(b), quoted above,that   the   construction  of  labour  colonies,   under   aGovernment-sponsored  Housing Scheme, has been	included  inthe  category  of  'works of public  utility'.	 As  alreadyindicated,  even  apart	 from the indication  given  by	 the(amended) section 17, quoted above, this Court has held,  inthe  recent  decision  (1)  that  building  of	 residentialquarters  for industrial labour is public  purpose.   Hence,even apart from the amended provisions of s. 17, it is clearon  the authorities that the purpose for which the land	 wasbeing acquired was a public purpose.(1)  [1961] 1 S.C.R. 128.468Having	cleared the ground, it now remains to  consider	 theterms of s. 6, on which great reliance was placed on  behalfof  the appellants.  There is no doubt that, as pointed	 outin   the  recent  decision  of	this  Court  (1),  the	 Actcontemplates  acquisition  for a public purpose	 and  for  aCompany,  thus	conveying the idea that	 acquisition  for  aCompany	 is not for a public purpose.  It has been  held  bythis  Court, in that decision, that the purposes  of  publicutility,  referred to in ss. 40-41 of the Act, are  akin  topublic purpose.	 Hence, acquisition for a public purpose  asalso   acquisitions   for   a  Company	 are   governed	  byconsiderations of public utility.  But the procedure for thetwo  kinds of acquisitions is different, in so far  as	PartVII has made substantive provisions for acquisitions of landfor  Companies.	  Where	 acquisition is made  for  a  publicpurpose, the cost of acquisition for payment of compensationhas  to be paid wholly or partly out of Public Revenues,  orsome  fund controlled or managed by a local  authority.	  Onthe other hand, in the case of an acquisition for a Company,the  compensation  has to be paid by the Company.   But,  insuch a case, there has to be an agreement, under s. 41,	 forthe  transfer of the land acquired by the Government to	 theCompany on payment of the cost of acquisition, as also othermatters not material to our present purpose.  The  agreementcontemplated  by  s. 41 is to be entered  into	between	 theCompany and the Appropriate Government only after the latteris satisfied about the purpose of the proposed	acquisition,and  subject  to the condition precedent that  the  previousconsent of the Appropriate Government has been given to	 theacquisition.	The  `	previous  consent'  itself  of	 theAppropriate   Government   is  made  to	 depend	  upon	 thesatisfaction  of  that Government that the  purpose  of	 theacquisition  was as laid down in s. 40.	 It is, thus,  clearthat  the  provisions  of  ss.	39-41  lay  down  conditionsprecedent  to the application of the machinery of  the	LandAcquisition Act, if the acquisition is meant for a  Company.Now,  s. 6 itself contains the prohibition to the making  ofthe necessary declaration under that section in these terms-(1)  (1961] 1 S.C.R. 128.469"Provided that no such declaration shall be made unless	 thecompensation  to be awarded for such property is to be	paidby a Company, or wholly or partly out of public revenues  orsome fund controlled or managed by a local authority".Section	 6 is, in terms, made subject to the  provisions  ofPart VII of the Act.  The provisions of Part VII, read	withs.  6 of the Act, lead to this result that  the	 declarationfor  the acquisition for a Company shall not be made  unlessthe  compensation  to be awarded for the property is  to  bepaid by a company.  The declaration for the acquisition	 fora  public  purpose,  similarly, cannot be  made	 unless	 thecompensation, wholly or partly, is to be paid out of  publicfunds.	 Therefore,  in	 the case of an	 acquisition  for  aCompany simpliciter, the declaration cannot be made  withoutsatisfying the requirements of Part VII.  But, that does notnecessarily  mean  that an acquisition for a Company  for  apublic	purpose	 cannot	 be made otherwise  than  under	 theprovisions of Part VII, if the cost or a portion of the costof the acquisition is to come out of public funds.  In otherwords, the essential condition for acquisition for a  publicpurpose is that the cost of the acquisition should be borne,wholly	or  in	part,  out  of	public	funds.	 Hence,	  anacquisition  for  a Company may also be made  for  a  publicpurpose,  within  the meaning of the Act, if a part  or	 thewhole  of  the cost of acquisition is met by  public  funds.If,  on the other hand, the acquisition for a Company is  tobe made at the cost entirely of the Company itself, such  anacquisition  comes under the provisions of Part VII.  As  inthe  present instance, it appears that part at any  rate  ofthe  compensation  to be awarded for the acquisition  is  tocome eventually from out of public revenues, it must be heldthat  the acquisition is not for a Company simpliciter.	  Itwas  not, therefore, necessary to go through  the  procedureprescribed  by	Part  VII.  We, therefore,  agree  with	 theconclusion  of	the  High Court, though	 not  for  the	samereasons.The appeal, accordingly, is dismissed with costs.				      Appeal dismissed.470
