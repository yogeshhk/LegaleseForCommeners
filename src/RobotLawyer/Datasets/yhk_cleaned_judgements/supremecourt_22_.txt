On  aparticular festival day both the groups went to a temple forworship	 and  cultivators  who	reached	 the  temple   firstoccupied  a  place  therein which was  usually	occupied  byRajputs.   Subsequently	 Rajputs arrived  and  resented	 theoccupation  of the sitting place by the	 cultivators.	Theyshifted	 to  a	short distance and  after  holding  a  briefconference  came  back	to  the	 temple	 and  attacked	 thecultivators  with  guns, swords and lathis as  a  result  ofwhich  several persons were injured and two were killed.  43persons	 alleged to have taken part in the rioting were	 putup for trial before the Sessions judge for having  committedoffences  under	 s. 302 read with s. 149 and s. 148  of	 theIndian	Penal Code.  The Sessions judge held that  a  commonobject	on the part of the accused to kill  the	 cultivatorshad  not  been	established and that it had  also  not	beenproved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were  guiltyof  a  particular offence.  On these findings  the  Sessionsjudge  acquitted all the accused.  On appeal the High  Courtafter  examining  the  entire evidence	found  some  of	 theaccused guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to  murderunder S. 304 read with s. 149 and s. 148 of the Indian PenalCode  and sentenced them to various terms  of  imprisonment.The appeal in respect of some other accused was dismissed asno case had been made out against them beyond any reasonabledoubt On appeal by special leave against the conviction	 andsentence by the High Court,Held,  that the words "substantial and	compelling  reasons"for  setting aside an order of acquittal used by this  Courtin  its decisions were intended to convey the idea  that  anappellate  court shall not only bear in mind the  principleslaid  down  by the Privy Council in Sheo Swarup's  case	 butmust  also  give  its  clear  reasons  for  coming  to	 theconclusion that the order of acquittal was wrong.The following results emanate from a discussion of the	caselaw on appeals against acquittal:-(1)an  appellate  court	 has  full  power  to  review  theevidence  upon which the order of acquittal is founded;	 (2)the principles121laid  down in Sheo Swarup's case afford a correct guide	 forthe  appellate court's approach to a case disposing of	suchan  appeal;  (3)  the  different  phraseology  used  in	 thejudgments  of  this  Court, such  as  (1)  "substantial	 andcompelling  reasons",  (II) "good  and	sufficiently  cogentreasons",  and (III) "strong reasons", are not	intended  tocurtail	 the  undoubted power of an appellate Court    in anappeal	against acquittal to review the entire evidence	 andto come to its own conclusion, but in doing so it should notonly consider every matter on record having a bearing on thequestions  of fact and the reasons given by the Court  belowin  support  of	 its order of acquittal	 in  arriving  at  aconclusion on those facts, but should express the reasons inits  judgment, which led it to hold that the  acquittal	 wasnot justified.Sheo Swarup v.

L.	 Kohli and C. L. Sareen, for the appellants.S.   K. Kapur and D. Gupta, for the respondent.1960.	December  9.  The Judgment of  the  Court	 wasdelivered bySUBBA RAO, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against theconviction and sentence by the High Court of Judicature	 forRajasthan at Jodhpur of the 9 appellants under s. 304,	readwith s. 149, and s. 148 of the Indian Penal Code.The 9 appellants, along with 34 other persons, were  accusedbefore	the Sessions Judge, Merta.  Briefly stated the	caseof  the prosecution was as follows: There were two  factionsin  village Harnawa-one consisting of Rajputs and  other  ofthe  cultivators  of  the village.   Admittedly	 there	weredisputes  between these two factions in respect	 of  certainfields.	  At  about 3-30 p.m. on October 31, 1951,  the	 dayafter  Diwali,	popularly  known as Ram Ram  day,  both	 thegroups	 went	to  a  temple  called	Baiji-kathan.	 Thecultivators  went first to the temple and sat in  the  placewhich  was  usually occupied by the  Rajputs.	Subsequentlywhen the Rajputs went there, they found their usual  sittingplace occupied by the cultivators and took that as an insultto  them.  Though they were invited by the pujari to sit  insome other place, they refused to do so and went to a banyantree  which was at a short distance from the temple.   Therethey held a brief conference and then returned to the templearmed  with guns, swords and lathies.  The Rajputs  fired  afew shots at the cultivators and also beat them with  swordsand  lathies.  As a result, 16 of the  cultivators  receivedinjuries and of these 6 received gun-shot injuries, of whichtwo  persons,  namely,	Deena and  Deva,  succumbed  to	 theinjuries.   Out	 of  the remaining  14	injured	 persons,  3received grievous injuries and the rest simple ones.  Forty-three  persons, alleged to have taken part in  the  rioting,were put up for trial before the Sessions Judge,, Merta, forhaving	committed offences under s. 302, read with  s.	149,and  s. 148 of the Indian Penal Code.  Five of	the  accusedadmitted their presence at the scene of			    123occurrence  but	 pleaded  that after  they  had	 made  theircustomary  offerings  at  the  temple  and  when  they	werereturning  they	 were attacked by the  cultivators.   Otherspleaded alibi.The  learned  Sessions	Judge  held that  it  had  not	beenestablished that the accused had a common object to kill thecultivators and that it had also not been proved beyond	 anyreasonable  doubt  that any of the accused was guilty  of  aparticular offence.  On these findings, he acquitted all theaccused.On  appeal the learned Judges of the High Court	 found	thatthe accused were members of an unlawful assembly, that	theywere animated by a common object of beating the	 cultivatorsand  that further out of the 43 accused it had been  clearlyestablished  that the appellants, who are 9 in number,	tookpart  in the activities of the unlawful assembly.   On	thatfinding	 they held that the accused were guilty of  culpablehomicide not amounting to murder under s. 304, read with  s.149, Indian Penal Code; they also held that appellants 1, 2,3  and 4 were also guilty under s. 148 of the  Indian  PenalCode,  as they were armed with deadly weapons, and the	restunder  s. 147, Indian Penal Code.  For the offence under  s.304, read with s. 149, the appellants were sentenced to	 tenyears'	rigorous imprisonment, and for the offence under  s.148, appellants 1 to 4 were further sentenced to one  year'srigorous  imprisonment	and the rest under s.  147,  to	 sixmonths'	 rigorous imprisonment.	 Having examined the  entireevidence,  they agreed with the learned Sessions Judge	thatno  case had been made out against the other accused  beyondany reasonable doubt.  The appeal was, therefore, allowed inrespect	 of the nine appellants and dismissed in respect  ofthe othersLearned	 counsel  for  the  appellants	contended  that	 theSessions  Judge	 came  to a  reasonable	 conclusion  on	 theevidence  and that the.	 High Court had no  substantial	 andcompelling reasons to take a different view.In  recent years the words "compelling reasons" have  becomewords of magic incantation in every124appeal	against	 acquittal.  The words are so  elastic	thatthey  are not capable of easy definition; with	the  result,their  interpretation varied between two  extreme  views-oneholding	 that  if  a trial court acquitted  an	accused,  anappellate  court shall not take a different view unless	 thefinding is such that no reasonable person will come to	thatconclusion,  and the other accepting only the conscience  ofthe  appellate court as the yardstick to  ascertain  whetherthere  are  reasons  to compel	its  interference.   In	 thecircumstances we think it necessary to clarify the point.The  scope of the powers of an appellate court in an  appealagainst	 acquittal has been elucidated by the Privy  Councilin  Sheo Swarup v. King-Emperor There Lord Russell  observedat p. 404 thus:	      "........	 the  High  Court  should  and	will	      always give proper weight and consideration to	      such  matters  as (1) the views of  the  trial	      Judge as to the credibility of the  witnesses,	      (2) the presumption of innocence in favour  of	      the  accused,  a	presumption  certainly	 not	      weakened by the fact that he has been  acquit-	      ted at his trial, (3) the right of the accused	      to  the  benefit	of any doubt,  and  (4)	 the	      slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a	      finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who	 had	      the advantage of seeing the witnessesAdverting  to  the  facts of the  case,	 the  Privy  Councilproceeded to state,	      "........	 They have no reason to	 think	that	      the  High	 Court	failed to  take	 all  proper	      matters  into  consideration  in	arriving  at	      their conclusions of fact."These two passages indicate the principles to be followed byan  appellate  court  in  disposing  of	 an  appeal  againstacquittal  and	also the proper care it should take  in	 re-evaluating  the evidence.  The Privy Council  explained	 itsearlier observations in Nur Mohammad v. Emperor (2) thus  atp. 152:	      "Their Lordships do not think it necessary  to	      read  it all again, but would like to  observe	      that  there really is only one  principle,  in	      the  strict use of the word, laid down  there;	      that is that the High	      (1) (1934) L.R. 61 I.A. 398.	      (2) A.I.R. 1945 P.C. 151.	      125	      Court  has full power to review at  large	 all	      the evidence upon which the order of acquittal	      was founded, and to reach the conclusion	that	      upon  that  evidence the	order  of  acquittal	      should be reversed."These two decisions establish that the power of an appellatecourt  in an appeal against acquittal is not different	fromthat it has in an appeal against conviction; the  differencelies  more in the manner of approach and perspective  ratherthan in the content of the power.  These decisions  definingthe  scope  of	the power of an	 appellate  court  had	beenfollowed by all the courts in India till the year 1951 when,it  is said, this Court in Surajpal Singh v. The  State	 (1)laid  down  a different principle.  But a  perusal  of	thatjudgment  does not bear out the construction which  is	veryoften  placed thereon.	The passage relied upon is found  atp. 201 and it reads thus:	      "It  is  well-established that  in  an  appeal	      under  section 417 of the	 Criminal  Procedure	      Code, the High Court has full power to  review	      the evidence upon which the order of acquittal	      was  founded, but it is equally  well  settled	      that  the	 presumption  of  innocence  of	 the	      accused is further reinforced by his acquittal	      by  the trial court, and the findings  of	 the	      trial court which had the advantage of  seeing	      the  witnesses and hearing their evidence	 can	      be  reversed  only for  very  substantial	 and	      compelling reasons."On the facts of that case this Court held, "we are  inclinedto hold that the Sessions Judge had taken a reasonable	viewof  the facts of the case, and in our opinion there were  nogood reasons for reversing that view".	We think that  theseobservations are nothing more than a restatement of the	 lawlaid  down by the Privy Council and the application  of	 thesame  to the facts of the case before the Court.  Though  inone paragraph the learned Judges used the words "substantialand compelling reasons" and in the next paragraph the  words"good  reasons",  these observations were  not	intended  torecord any disagreement(1)[1952] S.C.R. 193.126with the observations of Lord Russell in Sheo Swarup's	case(1)  as	 to  matters a High Court would keep  in  view	whenexercising its power under s. 417 of the Criminal  ProcedureCode.  If it had been so intended, this Court would have  atleast referred to Sheo Swarup's case (1), which it did	not.The  same words were again repeated by this Court  in  AjmerSingh  v.  The	State  of Punjab  (2).	 In  that  case	 theappellate  court  set  aside an order of  acquittal  on	 theground	 that  the  accused  had  failed  to   explain	 thecircumstances  appearing against him.  This court held	thatas the presumption of innocence of an accused is  reinforcedby  the order of acquittal, the appellate court	 could	haveinterfered only for substantial and compelling reasons.	 Theobservations  made  in	respect	 of  the  earlier  decisionsapplied	 to  this case also.  Mahajan, J., as he  then	was,delivering  the judgment of the court in Puran v.  State  ofPunjab	(3)  again  used the  words  "very  substantial	 andcompelling reasons", but immediately thereafter the  learnedJudge referred to the decision of Sheo Swarup's case(1)	 andnarrated  the circumstances which an appellate court  shouldbear  in  mind in interfering with an  order  of  acquittal.This   juxtaposition  of  the  so-called  formula  and	 thecircumstances  narrated in Sheo Swarup's case  (1)  indicatethat  the learned Judge used those words only to  comprehendthe statement of law made by the Privy Council.	  Mukherjea,J., as he then was, in C. M. Narayan v.State of Travancore-Cochin (4) again referred to thePrivy  Council	 decisionand affirmed the wide powerof an appellate court and alsothe  proper  approach in an appeal against  acquittal.	 Thelearned	 Judge did not introduce any further  limitation  onthe power of the appellate court.  But it was observed	thatthe  High  Court  had not clearly kept before  it  the	wellsettled	 principles and reversed the decision of  the  trialcourt	'without   noticing  or	 giving	  due	weight	 andconsideration  to  important  matters relied  upon  by	thatcourt'.	 In Tulsiram Kanu v. The State (5) this(1)  (1934) L.R. 61 I.A. 398.(2)  [1953] S.C.R. 418.(3)  A I.R. 1933 S.C. 459.(4)  A.I.R. 1953 S.C. 478.(5) A.I.R. 1954 8.C. I.127Court used a different phraseology to describe the  approachof an appellate court against an order of acquittal.   Therethe   Sessions	Court  expressed  that	there  was   clearlyreasonable  doubt in respect of the guilt of the accused  onthe  evidence put before it. Kania, C. J., observed that  itrequired  good and sufficiently cogent reasons	to  overcomesuch  reasonable doubt before the appellate court came to  adifferent   conclusion.	  This	observation  was   made	  inconnection with a High Court's judgment which had not  takeninto  consideration the different detailed reasons given  bythe  Sessions  Judge.  In Madan Mohan Singh's case  (1),  onappeal by special leave, this Court said that the High Court'had not kept the rules and principles of administration  ofcriminal  justice clearly before it and that  therefore	 thejudgment    was	  vitiated   by	  non-advertence   to	 andmisapprehension	 of  various material facts  transpiring  inevidence and the consequent failure to give true weight	 andconsideration  to  the findings upon which the	trial  courtbased  its decision'.  In Zwinglee Ariel v. State of  M.  P.(2) this Court again cited the passage from the decision  ofthe  Privy  Council extracted above and applied	 it  to	 thefacts  of that case.  In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State  ofVindhya	 Pradesh(1), Bhagwati, J., speaking for	 the  Court,after  referring  to  an earlier  decision  of	this  Court,accepted  the principle laid down by the Privy Council	and,indeed,	 restated the observations of the Privy	 Council  infour propositions.  It may be noticed that the learned Judgedid  not  use  the  words  cc  substantial  and	  compellingreasons".  In S. A. A. Biyabani v. The State of Madras	(4),Jagannadhadas, J., after referring to the earlier decisions,observed at p. 647 thus:	      "While  no  doubt on such an appeal  the	High	      Court  was entitled to go into the  facts	 and	      arrive  at its own estimate of the  evidence,	      it  is also settled law that, where  the	case	      turns  on	 oral  evidence	 of  witnesses,	 the	      estimate	of such evidence by the trial  court	      is not to be lightly set aside."(1) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 637.	(2) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 15.(3) A I.R. 1954 S.C. 322.	(4) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 645.128The  learned Judge did not repeat the so-called formula	 butin  effect accepted the approach of the Privy Council.	 Thequestion  was again raised prominently in the Supreme  Courtin Aher Raja Khima ,"v.	 The State of Saurashtra(1).   Bose,J., expressing the majority view, stated at p. 1287 thus:	      "It  is, in our opinion, well settled that  it	      is  not  enough for the High Court to  take  a	      different	 view  of the evidence;	 there	must	      also be substantial and compelling reasons for	      holding that the trial court was wrong:  Ajmer	      Singh v. State of Punjab (2); and if the trial	      Court takes a reasonable view of the facts  of	      the  case, interference under section  417  is	      not justifiable unless there are really strong	      reasons for reversing that view."It   may   be  noticed	that  the  learned   Judge   equated"substantial and compelling reasons" with "strong  reasons".Kapur, J., in bhagwan Das V. State of Rajasthan(1)  referredto  the earlier decisions and observed that the	 High  Courtshould	not  set  aside	 an acquittal  unless  there  are  "substantial and compelling reasons" for doing so.  In BalbirSingh  v. State of Punjab (4), this Court observed  much  tothe same effect thus at p. 222:	      "It  is now well settled that though the	High	      Court  has full power to review  the  evidence	      upon  which an order of acquittal is  founded,	      it   is	equally	 well	settled	  that	 the	      presumption of innocence of the accused person	      is further reinforced by his acquittal by	 the	      trial  Court and the views of the trial  Judge	      as to the credibility of the witnesses must be	      given proper weight and consideration; and the	      slowness of an appellate Court in disturbing a	      finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who	 had	      the  advantage  of seeing the  witnesses	must	      also  be	kept  in  mind	and  there  must  be	      substantial  and	compelling reasons  for	 the	      appellate	 Court	to  come  to  a	  conclusion	      different from that of the trial Judge."These observations only restate the principles laid  down bythis Court in earlier decisions.  There are(1)  [1955] 2 S.C.R. 1285.(2)  [1953] S.C.P. 418, 423.(3)  A.I. R. 1957 S.C. 689.(4)  A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 216.129other  decisions  of this Court where,	without	 discussion,this  Court affirmed the judgments of the High Courts  wherethey interfered with an order of acquittal without violatingthe principles laid down by the Privy Council.There is no difficulty in applying the principles laid	downby  the	 Privy Council, and accepted by this Court,  to	 thefacts  of  each	 case.	But  appellate	courts	are  findingconsiderable  difficulty in understanding the scope  of	 thewords  "substantial  and compelling reasons"  used  by	thisCourt  in the decisions cited above.  This  Court  obviouslydid  not  and  could not add a condition to s.	417  of	 theCriminal Procedure Code.  The words were intended to  conveythe idea that an appellate court not only shall bear in mindthe principles laid down by the Privy Council but also	mustgive its clear reasons for coming to the conclusion that theorder of acquittal was wrong.The  foregoing discussion yields the following results:	 (1)an  appellate  court has full power to review  the  evidenceupon  which  the  order of acquittal  is  founded;  (2)	 theprinciples  laid  down	in Sheo Swarup's  case(1)  afford  acorrect	 guide for the appellate court's approach to a	casein  disposing  of  such an appeal;  and	 (3)  the  differentphraseology  used in the judgments of this Court,  such	 as,(i)  "substantial  and compelling reasons", (ii)  "good	 andsufficiently cogent reasons", and (iii) "strong reasons" arenot intended to curtail the undoubted power of an  appellatecourt  in an appeal against acquittal to review	 the  entireevidence and to come to its own conclusion; but in doing  soit should not only consider every matter on record having  abearing	 on the questions of fact and the reasons  given  bythe court below in support of its order of acquittal in	 itsarriving  at  a conclusion on those facts, but	should	alsoexpress those reasons in its judgment, which lead it to holdthat the acquittal was not justified.With  this background we shall now look at the	judgment  ofthe Sessions Judge and that of the High(1)  (1934) L.R. 61 I.A. 398.17130Court to ascertain whether the High Court anywhere  departedfrom the principles laid down by the Privy Council.The framework of the judgment of the learned Sessions  Judgemay  be shortly stated thus: The first question was  whetherthe  case of the prosecution that the Rajputs  met. under  abanyan tree, conspired to beat the Jats and came back to thetemple armed with weapons was true.  This fact was spoken toby  several eve-witnesses, including Goga (P.W. 1),  Chandra(P.W.  2) and Doongar Singh (P.W. 21).	This fact  was	alsomentioned in the First Information Report lodged by  DoongarSingh (P.W. 21).  There were 20 eyewitnesses who spoke aboutthe conspiracy; and, out of them, P.Ws. 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15,16, 17, 18. 19. 24 and 25 received injuries during the riot.The learned Sessions Judge considered the evidence of  P.Ws.1 and 2 and rejected it on unsubstantial grounds and on	 thebasis of insignificant discrepancies.  Therefter, he noticedthat   all   the  other	 eye-witnesses,	 with	slight	 andinconsequential	 variations,  spoke  to the  fact  of  theirreturning  from	 the banyan tree with  lathies,	 swords	 andguns'  but  he did not give a definite	finding	 whether  heaccepted that evidence or not, though at the fag end of	 thejudgment  he found that he could not hold that the  assemblyof  Rajputs had any common object of killing anybody.	Thenthe learned Sessions Judge proceeded to consider whether anyof the Rajputs were recognized by any of the witnesses.	  Hedivided	 the  accused into three groups, namely,  (i)  thoseaccused who were amongst the Rajputs when they had come	 fordarshan	 of Baiji, (ii) those accused who were	amongst	 theRajputs when they returned from the banyan tree but for whomthe  evidence  of  taking  part in  the	 actual	 rioting  isdivided,  and (iii) those accused for whom most of the	eye-witnesses  have stated that they had committed	rioting	 andinflicted  injuries on the assembly of cultivators.   Takingthe first group, the learned Sessions Judge, for the reasonsgiven  by  him earlier, rejected the evidence  of  Goga	 andChandra,  pointed  out that 28 accused had  not	 been  namedunanimously by all the eye-witnesses,			    131noticed	 that  there was long standing	enmity	between	 theRajputs and the cultivators, and laid down a criterion that,for  determining  the presence of  any	particular  accused,there  should be an allegation against him about  doing	 anyovert  act in the unlawful, assembly.  By applying the	saidyardstick  he held that none of the accused falling  in	 thefirst  group,  which  included appellants 7, 8	and  9,	 wasguilty of the offences with which they were charged.  Comingto  the second category, with which we are not concerned  inthis  appeal, the learned Sessions Judge again	applied	 thetest that an overt act should be proved against each of	 theaccused	 and  held that no case had been  made	out  againstthem.  Adverting to the third group, after noticing that  12of  the eye-witnesses were those who received injuries,	 thelearned	 Sessions Judge applied another test  for  acceptingtheir evidence.	 In effect and substance the test adopted byhim  was that an accused identified only by one witness	 andnot proved to have done any overt act should be acquitted bygiving him the benefit of doubt.  Applying this test to	 thesaid  witnesses	 he  held that the  said  accused  were	 notguilty.	  After	 considering the evidence in  the  aforesaidmanner, he came to the following final conclusion:	      "I  cannot hold that the assembly	 of  Rajputs	      had any common object of killing anybody.	 All	      happened	at  the spur of the  moment.   Those	      Rajputs who took part in the rioting have	 not	      been truthfully named.  Innocent persons	have	      been implicated and the cases of those persons	      who  are alleged to have committed  any  overt	      acts are also full of doubts."On  appeal the learned Judges of the High Court, as  alreadystated,	 allowed the appeal in respect of the  9  appellantsand  dismissed	it  in regard to the  others.	The  learnedJudges	of  the	 High Court observed that  it  had  not	 theslightest hesitation in holding that the case put forward bythe  prosecution, by and large, represented the	 substantialtruth  and that the incidents at the banyan tree were  true.They  pointed  out that the reasons given  by  the  SessionsJudge for not believing the evidence of the main  witnesses,Goga132and  Chandra,  who spoke as to what happened at	 the  banyantree,	could  not  be	sustained  and	that   the   allegeddiscrepancies and contradictions in their evidence were	 notsuch  as  to detract from truthfulness.	 We have  also	gonethrough	 the  evidence of Goga and Chandra and	we  entirelyagree  with  the observations of the learned Judges  of	 theHigh  Court that their evidence was natural  and  consistentand  that the alleged discrepancies pointed out by the	Ses-sions  Judge were not either contradictions at all or,	evenif  they were so, they were so trivial as to affect  in	 anyway their veracity.  The learned Judges further pointed	 outthat  the evidence of Goga and Chandra was supported by	 theevidence  of Doongar Singh (P.	W. 21), a police  constable,who gave the First Information Report at the earliest  pointof  time.   The	 recitals in the  First	 Information  Reportcorroborate his evidence.  The learned Judges then indicatedthat  this version was practically supported by	 other	eve-witnesses and that they did not see any reason why it shouldhave  been invented, if it was not true.  Having  regard  tothe said evidence, they found themselves entirely unable  toaccept	the conclusion of the learned trial Judge that	thiswas  a	case  where  a	stray  beating	was  given  by	someindividuals  on the side of the Rajputs to some	 individualson  the Bide of the Jats.  They found that the Rajputs	weremembers	 of  an	 unlawful assembly and that  they  were	 allanimated  by  a common object of  beating  the	cultivators.Having	held  that the learned Sessions	 Judge	was  clearlywrong  on  the question of unlawful  assembly,	the  learnedJudges proceeded  to consider the case	of  each  accused.They  adopted  the  following  principle,  based  upon	 thedecision of this Court in Abdul Gani v. State of M. P. (1):	      "We quite recognise that in a case of  rioting	      where  two  inimical  factions  are  involved,	      exaggerations  are bound to be made, and	some	      innocent	persons	 are likely  to	 be  falsely	      implicated;  but all the same, it is the	duty	      of the courts not to throw out the whole	case	      by following the easy method of	      (1)   A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 31.	      133	      relying on discrepancies, and, where the	case	      for the prosecution is substantially true,  to	      find  out if any of the accused  participated,	      in  the  offence,	 and if	 their	presence  is	      established   beyond  all	 reasonable   doubt,	      punish  them  for the  offences  committed  by	      them."They found, on the evidence, that appellant 1, Sanwat Singh,who  was  present on the spot was a member of  the  unlawfulassembly and had actually struck Sheonath with his sword  asa  result  of  which  his  three  fingers  were	 cut; thatappellant  2, Dhan Singh, was one of the persons who took  aleading part in the beating; that appellant 3, Mangej Singh,was  undoubtedly  one of the participants  in  the  unlawfulassembly;  that	 appellant 4, Kalu Singh, was armed  with  asword and attacked the Jats and that his version that he hadbeen first attacked by the Jats was not true; that appellant5,  Narain  Singh, was one of the members  of  the  unlawfulassembly  and  that he had given beatings to P.W.  25;	thatappellant 6, Gulab Singh, struck Sheokaran Jat with lathies;and that appellant 7, Sabal Singh, appellant 8, Baney Singh,and appellant 9, Inder Singh, who admitted their presence atthe  spot  but stated that they were attacked by  the  Jats,were  clearly participators in the beating.  As regards	 theother  accused,	 the  learned Judges,  having  examined	 theentire	evidence, agreed with the Sessions Judge in  holdingthat no case had been made out against those accused  beyondall reasonable doubt.  So far as these accused are concernedthere  is no evidence to show that any of them had a  weaponor that they had taken any active part in assaulting one  orother of the Jats.  In the result, the learned Judges of theHigh  Court  found that the appellants	formed	an  unlawfulassembly to beat the Jats and that they must have known thatmurders	 were likely to be committed in prosecution of	thatcommon object.	On that finding, they convicted and  senten-ced the appellants as stated earlier in the judgment.Now,  can  it  be  said that, as  learned  counsel  for	 theappellants argues, the Judges of the High Court had  ignoredany of the principles laid down by the Privy134Council and subsequently accepted by this Court?  Wethink not.The  foregoing	analysis of the findings of the	 two  courtsdiscloses  the following facts: The Sessions judge,  on	 thegeneral case of the prosecution that the Rajputs,  chagrinedby  the attitude of the Jats in occupying their usual  placein  the	 temple, went to the banyan tree,  conferred  for  ashort  time and came back to the temple to attack the  Jats,rejected  the  evidence	 of  the  main	witnesses  for	 theprosecution,  namely,  Goga, Chandra and Doongar  Singh,  ongrounds	 which do not stand a moment's scrutiny and  ignoredthe voluminous evidence, which corroborated the evidence  ofthe said three witnesses, without giving valid or acceptablereasons	 for the same.	The learned Sessions Judge  did	 noteven  give  a  definite	 finding  on  this  version  of	 theprosecution case, though impliedly he must be deemed to haverejected  it.  In regard to the individual cases he  dividedthe   witnesses	  into	three  categories,   and,   applyingmechanical  tests, refused to act upon their evidence.	 TheHigh Court rightly pointed out that there was no reason	 whythe  voluminous evidence in support of the general case	 andwhy  the evidence of the three witnesses, Goga, Chandra	 andDoongar	 Singh, should be rejected.  The learned  Judges  ofthe  High Court accepted their evidence, which	conclusivelyestablished  that  the general case was true  and  that	 theappellants  actually took active part in attacking the	Jatswith  swords and lathies.  In doing so, the  learned  Judgesdid  not depart from any of the principles laid down by	 thePrivy Council.	Indeed, they interfered with the judgment ofthe Sessions Judge, as they came to the conclusion that, thesaid  judgment, in so far as the appellants were  concerned,was  clearly  wrong  and contrary to  the  overwhelming	 andreliable  evidence adduced in the case.	 The learned  Judgesof the High Court, in our opinion, approached the case	froma  correct  perspective	 and gave  definite  findings  on  aconsideration of the entire evidence.The  question now is, whether the appellants have  made	 outany  case  for interference with the judgment  of  the	HighCourt under Art. 136 of the Constitution.135Article 136 of the Constitution confers a wide discretionarypower  on this Court to entertain appeals in suitable  casesnot  otherwise	provided  for by the  Constitution.   It  isimplicit in the reserve power that it cannot be exhaustivelydefined,  but  decided cases-, do  not	permit	interferenceunless	"by disregard to the forms of legal process or	someviolation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise,substantial and grave injustice has been done".	 Though Art.136  is couched in widest terms, the practice of this  Courtis  not to interfere on questions of fact except  in  excep-tional	cases  when the finding is such that it	 shocks	 theconscience  of	the court.  In the present  case,  the	HighCourt has not contravened any of the principles laid down inSheo Swarup's case (1) and has also given reasons which	 ledit  to	hold that the acquittal was not justified.   In	 thecircumstances,	no  case  has  been made  out  for  our	 notaccepting the said findings.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.
