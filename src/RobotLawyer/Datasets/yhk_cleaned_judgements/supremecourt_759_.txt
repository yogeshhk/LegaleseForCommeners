Mohan	Lal was the karta of the  aforesaid  family,which  consisted of himself and his two brothers,  Chhotelaland  Bansilal.	The firm made profits during the  accountingyears  ending  1943  and 1944 on which it  was	assessed  toexcess	profits tax respectively of Rs. 10,023/5/-  and	 Rs.13,005/5/-.  During the year 19441945 it sustained a loss ofRs.  15,771  and  adding thereto  Rs.  37,800  the  standardprofits	 for  the business, the Excess Profits	Tax  Officerdetermined  the	 deficiency of profits for the year  at	 Rs.53,571 . Acting under s. 7 of the Excess Profits Tax Act theExcess	Profits	 Tax Officer passed an order  on  23-12-1946whereby	 after setting off the profits of the firm  for	 theyears ending 1943 and 1944 against the deficiency of profitsduring	the  year ending 1945, he directed a refund  of	 Rs.23,028/10/-  which had been paid by the appellant as  excessprofits tax for those years.  At the commencement of the assessment year 1944-1945 therewas  a partition in the joint family of which Mohan Lal	 waserstwhile karta, he and his two brothers becoming divided instatus.	  As  a	 result	 thereof  the  appellant  firm	 wasreconstituted  under  an  agreement  dated  17-10-1944,	 thepartners  of  the firm being five in number.   There  was  areconstitution of the firm with respect to persons144and  their  shares.   According to s.  8(1)  of	 the  ExcessProfits Tax Act the change in the persons is deemed to bringabout  a  discontinuation  of  the  old	 business  and	 thecommencement  of  a new one and if that section	 applied  norelief	could have been granted to the appellant under s.  7of the Act.The  facts as to the reconstitution of the firm having	cometo  the knowledge of the Commissioner of Excess Profits	 Taxhe issued a notice under s. 20 of the Excess Profits Tax Actcalling	 upon the appellant why the order of Excess  ProfitsTax Officer dated 23-12-1946 should not be set aside on	 theground	 of   mistake  as  he  had  failed  to	 take	intoconsideration  the  change in the constitution of  the	firmwhich took place on 17-10-1944.	 After hearing the appellantthe  Commissioner held by his order dated 15-3-1950 that  onthe  facts disclosed there was a change in the	persons	 andthat the award of relief under s. 7 of the Act by the ExcessProfits Tax Officer was a mistake.  He set aside order	onlyso far as Bhagat Ram Mohan Lal was concerned maintaining  itwith regard to two others.On an application for a writ of certiorari and for a writ ofprohibition  under  Art. 226 of the  Constitution  the	HighCourt upheld the order of the Commissioner.  On an appeal bySpecial Leave to the Supreme Court:Held (1) that by reason of the partition of the joint familyand the reconstitution of the firm under the deed dated	 17-10-1944	 there	was  a change in  the  persons	carrying  onbusiness within s. 8(1) of the Act.If  all the five persons who were mentioned as	partners  inthe deed of 1944 were partners of the old firm, there  wouldbe no change in the persons carrying on the business  withins.  8(1) of the Act by the mere fact of reshuffling  of	 theshares	among them but the real question  for  determinationwas whether Chhotelal and Bansilal were partners in the firmconstituted  on	 23-8-1940.   It  is  not  in  dispute	thatMohanlal  was  the karta of the joint family,  and  that  heentered into the partnership on 23-8-1940 as such karta.  Itis well settled that when the karta of a joint Hindu  familyenters into a partnership with strangers, the members of thefamily do not ipso facto become partners in that firm.	Theyhave  no right to take part in its management or to sue	 forits  dissolution.  The creditors of the firm would no  doubtbe  entitled  to  proceed against the  joint  family  assetsincluding  the	shares of the  non-partner  copareeners	 forrealisation  of their debts.  But that is because under	 theHindu Law, the karta has the right when properly carrying onbusiness  to  pledge the credit of the joint family  to	 theextent	of  its assets, and not because the  junior  membersbecome	partners  in  the business.  The  liability  of	 thejunior	 members  arises  by  reason  of  their	 status	  ascoparceners and not by reason of any contract of partnershipand  it would follow therefore that when Mohanlal  became  apartner	 of  the firm on 23-8-1940  Chhotelal  and  Bansilalcould  not  be	held by reason of that fact  alone  to	havebecome partners therein,145Accordingly whether the question was to be considered on theprinciples  of Hindu law or on the principles of the  ExcessProfits	 Tax Act there was a change in the personnel of	 thefirm on 17-10-1944 and the matter fell within s. 8(1) of theAct.(2)  That  there  was a mistake apparent on  the  record  asrequired  by  s.  20 of the Act	 and  the  Commissioner	 hadjurisdiction to pass the order dated 15-3-1950 which he did.There  was  no force in the contention that  the  record  inExcess Profits Tax proceedings consisted in the present caseof  the	 only order dated 23-12-1946 and that the  facts  onwhich  the proceedings were taken under s. 20,	namely,	 theconstitution  of  the  firm on	23-8-1940  and	the  changeseffected therein on 17-10-1944 were not recited therein	 andthat  in  consequence there were no materials  on  which  anorder  could  have been passed under  that  section  becausethough the order of the Excess Profits Tax Officer dated 23-12-1946 does not mention these facts these facts appear fromthe record of the income-tax proceedings which included the,registration  certificate of the firm under s. 26-A  of	 theIncome-Tax  Act and the returns made by the firm  disclosingthe names of the partners and their respective shares.	Fur-ther  the fact is that the proceedings under the  two  Acts,namely,	 the Excess Profits Tax Act and the Income Tax	Act,are interdependent.Lachman Das v. Commissioner of Income-Tax ([1948] 16 I.

The Judgment of the-Court was deliveredby.VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-The firm of Bhagat Ram Mohanlal,  whichis  the appellant before us, was constituted  on  23-8-1940,and  registered under section 26-A of the Indian  Income-taxAct, The partners of146the firm, according to the registration certificate, were(1)  Bhagat Ram Mohanlal, Hindu undivided family,(2)  Richpal and (3) Gajadhar, their shares beingrespectively  8 annas, 4 annas and 4 annas   Mohan  lal	 wasthe, karta of the aforesaid joint family, which consisted ofhimself and his two brothers, Chhotelal and Bansilal, and heentered	 into  the  partnership as  such  karta.   The	firmcarried	 on business at Drug in Madhya Pradesh as the  agentof the Government for the purchase of foodgrains, and duringthe  accounting years ending 1943 and 1944, it made  profitson which it was assessed to excess profits tax	respectivelyof Rs. 10,023-5-0 and Rs. 13,005-5-0.  During the year 1944-1945 it sustained a loss of Rs. 15,771, and adding it to thesum  of	 Rs. 37,800 which was the standard profits  for	 thebusiness,  the	Excess Profits Tax  Officer  determined	 thedeficiency of profits for the year at Rs. 53,571.  Section 7of  the Excess Profits Tax Act, hereinafter referred  to  asthe Act, provides that when there is a deficiency of profitsin  any	 chargeable accounting period in any  business,	 theprofits of that business during the previous years shall  bedeemed	to  be	reduced	 eo extanti,  and  that	 the  reliefnecessary to give effect to the reduction shall be given  byrepayment  of the tax paid or otherwise.  Acting under	thissection,  the Excess Profits Tax Officer passed an order  on23-12-1946 whereby after setting off the profits of the firmfor the years ending 1943 and 1944 against the deficiency ofprofits during the year ending 1945, he directed a refund ofRs.  23,028-10-0  which had been paid by  the  appellant  asexcess profits tax for those years.  It  should  be mentioned that at the commencement  of	 theassessment year 1944-1945 there was a partition in the jointfamily	of  which  Mohanlal was the erstwhile  karta,  as  aresult of which he and his brothers, Chhotelal and Bansilal,became divided in status.  Consequent on this disruption  ofthe joint family, the appellant firm was reconstituted underan  agreement dated 17-10-1944.	 Under this  agreement,	 thepartners of the firm were five in number, Richpal  .GajadharMohanlal, Chhotelal and Bansilal, the two147former	being entitled to 5 annas share each and the  latterthree  to 2 annas each.	 There was thus a reconstitution  ofthe  firm  both with reference to the persons who  were	 itspartners  and the shares which were allotted to them.	Now,section	 8(1) provides, omitting what is not material,	that"as from the date of any change in the persons carrying on abusiness,  the	business  shall	 be  deemed  to	 have	beendiscontinued and a new business commenced".  If this sectionapplied,  then	no  relief could have been  granted  to	 theappellant under section 7 of the Act.  The  facts  relating	to the reconstitution  of  the	firmhaving	come to the knowledge of the Commissioner of  ExcessProfits Tax on examination of the record, he issued a noticeon  19-2-1948 calling upon the appellant to show  cause	 whythe  order of -the Excess Profits Tax Officer  dated  23-12-1946 should not be set aside on the ground of mistake.	Thisnotice was issued under section 20 of the Act, which conferson  the	 Commissioner  authority  to  rectify  "any  mistakeapparent  from the record".  The mistake, according  to	 theCommissioner,  consisted in the Excess Profits	Tax  Officerfailing	 "to  take  into consideration	the  change  in	 theconstitution  of  the firm which took place  on	 17-10-1944,consequent  on the disruption of the joint Hindu  family  ofone of the partners".  The appellant appeared in response tothe notice, and contended that on the facts the	 proceedingsunder section 20 were misconceived.  The facts on which	 theproceedings were taken were not themselves disputed.  By hisorder  dated  15-3-1950 the Commissioner held  that  on	 thefacts  disclosed  on the record, there was a change  in	 thepersons	 carrying  on the business, and that  the  award  ofrelief under section 7 by the Excess Profits Tax Officer wasa  mistake.  He, however, maintained the order dated  23-12-1946  with  reference to Richpal and Gajadhar,	and  set  itaside only so far as "Bhagat Ram Mohanlal, Hindu.  undividedfamily"	 which was registered as partner on  23-8-1940,	 wasconcerned.   He further directed that Rs.  11,514-5-0  whichhad been refunded to it should be collected.148The appellant thereupon moved the High Court of Nagpur underarticle	 226 for a writ of certiorari quashing the order  ofthe   Commissioner  dated  15-3-1950  and  for	a  writ	  ofprohibition restraining the authorities from collecting	 Rs.11,514-5-0  under that order.  By their judgment dated	22ndAugust 1950, the learned Judges agreed with the Commissionerthat  by reason of the partition there was a change in	the-persons	 who  carried on the business, and  that  the  orderdated  23-12-1946 was contrary to section 8(1) of  the	Act.They  also held that as the mistake appeared on the face  ofthe record, the Commissioner had jurisdiction under  section20  of	the  Act to pass the order which  he  did.   In	 theresult, the writs -were refused.  Against this judgment, theappellant prefers this appeal by special leave.  Two  questions have been raised for our  determination  inthis  appeal: (1) whether by reason of the partition of	 thejoint  family and the reconstitution of the firm  under	 thedeed  dated  17-10-1944 there was a change  in	the  personscarrying on business within section 8(1) of the Act; and (2)whether the order of the Commissioner dated 15-3-1950 is badon  the ground that there was no mistake apparent  from	 therecord, as required by section 20 of the Act.  On the  firstquestion,  the	contention  of the appellant  is  that	whenMohanlal entered into partnership with Richpal and  Gajadharon 23-8-1940 as karta of the joint family, the other membersof  that  family,  Chhotelal and Bansilal,  also  became  insubstance  partners  of the firm, and that  when  they	werementioned  eo nominee as partners in the deed  dated  17-10-1944  the change was more formal than substantial, and	thatfurther	 the  fact that there was a re-allotment  of  sharesamong  the  partners  would not amount to a  change  in	 thepersons	 who carried on the business.  We agree that if	 allthe five persons who were mentioned as partners in the	deedof  1944  were partners of the old firm, there would  be  nochange	in  the	 persons carrying  on  the  business  withinsection	 8(1) of the Act by the mere fact of reshuffling  ofshares	among  them.  But the real question that has  to  bedecided149is whether Chhotelal and Bansilal were partners in the firm,which was constituted on 23-8-1940.  The appellant  contendsthat  they  were, both according to the Hindu law  and	evenapart	from   it,  under  the	general	 law   relating	  topartnerships.  It  is not in dispute that Mohanlal was the karta  of	 thejoint  family, and that he entered into the  partnership  on23-8-1940  as such karta.  It is well settled that when	 thekarta of a joint Hindu family enters into a partnership withstrangers,  the	 members  of the family do  not	 ipso  factobecome	partners in that firm.	They have no right  to	takepart  in its management or to sue for its dissolution.	 Thecreditors of the firm would no doubt be entitled to  proceedagainst the joint family assets including the shares of	 thenonpartner co-parceners for realisation of their debts.	 Butthat is because under the Hindu law, the karta has the rightwhen  properly carrying on business to pledge the credit  ofthe  joint  family  to the extent of  its  assets,  and	 notbecause the junior members become partners in the  business.In  short, the liability of the latter arises by  reason  oftheir status as copartners and not by reason of any contractof partnership by them.	 It would therefore follow that whenMohanlal  became  a  partner  of  the  firm  on	  23-8-1940,Chhotelal  and Bansilal could not be held by reason of	thatfact alone, to have become partners therein.  It is argued that when that firm was constituted on  23-8-1940   the  persons  who  entered  into	 the   contract	  ofpartnership  were not merely Mohanlal as karta of the  jointfamily	but also Chhotelal and Bansilal in their  individualcapacity, and that therefore they became partners under	 theordinary partnership law.  But the registration	 certificateof  the	 firm  while showing  "Bhagat  Ram  Mohanlal,  Hinduundivided  family" as a partner, makes no mention of  eitherChotelal or Bansilal as partners.  The contention that	theyalso  became in their individual capacity  partners  appearstherefore  to  be  an afterthought, and is  opposed  to	 thefindings  of the learned Judges of the High Court.  This  issufficient,  without  more, to dispose of  this	 contention.But even apart from this,20150it  is	difficult to visualise the situation which  the	 ap-pellant contends for, of a Hindu joint family entering	intoa  partnership	with  strangers through its  karta  and	 thejunior members of the family also becoming at the same	timeits partners in their personal capacity.  In Lachhman Das v.COmmissioner  of Incometax(1), it was held by  the  JudicialCommittee that the karta of a joint Hindu family could enterinto   partnership   with  an  individual  member   of	 thecoparcenary  quoad his separate property.  It was also	heldby  the Privy Council in Sundar Singh Majithia	v.  Commiss-ioner of Income-tax(2) that there was nothing in the Income-tax Act to prohibit the members of a joint Hindu family fromdividing  some	properties, while electing to  retain  theirjoint  status,	and  carrying on  business  as	partners  inrespect	 of those properties. treating them as its  capital.But  in	 the  present case, the	 basis	of  the	 partnershipagreement  of  1940 is that the family was  joint  and	thatMohanlal  was  its  karta  and	that  he  entered  into	 thepartnership  as karta on behalf of the joint family.  It  isdifficult to reconcile this position with that of  Chhotelaland  Bansilal  being  also partners in	the  firm  in  theirindividual  capacity, which can only be in respect of  theirseparate  or divided property.	If members of a	 coparcenaryare to be regarded as having become partners in a firm	withstrangers, they would also become under the partnership	 lawpartners inter se, and it would cut at the very root of	 thenotion	of  a  joint  undivided family	to  hold  that	withreference  to coparcenary properties the members can at	 thesame time be both coparceners and partners. To get over this difficulty, it was suggested that all	 thethree  coparceners might be regarded as having entered	intothe  contract of partnership as kartas of the joint  family.But  even  if  that  could be  done  consistently  with	 theprinciples of Hindu law, the very pleadings of the appellantare against such a supposition being made, affirming as theydo  that  it was only Mohanlal that was the karta,  not	 theothers.(1) [1948]16 I.T.R 35.(2) [1942] 10 I.T.R. 457.151The  contention,  therefore,  that  Chhotelal  and  Bansilalshould be held to have become partners in the old firm underthe agreement dated 23-8-1940 cannot be maintained.  The  question	 whether there was a change in	the  personscarrying on the business may now be considered independentlyof  the	 principles  of	 Hindu Law or  the  general  law  ofPartnership and with special reference to the provisions  ofthe Indian Excess Profits Tax Act.  Section 2(17) of the Actdefines	 a 'person' as including a joint  family.   Applyingthis  definition., who were the members of the firm when  itwas constituted on 23-8-1940?  Richpal, Gajadhar and "BhagatRam  Mohanlal, Hindu undivided family" consisting  of  threecoparceners,  Mohanlal,	 Chhotelal and	Bansilal,  it  beingimmaterial for the present purpose whether the karta of	 thefamily	was only Mohanlal, or all the three of them.   Then,the family became divided in 1944, and the result of it	 wasthat  one of the three persons who were partners in the	 oldfirm, "Bhagat Ram Mohanlal" ceased to exist.  On 17-10-1944,the  two  surviving partners of the old	 firm,	Richpal	 andGajadhar,  entered  into  a  contract  of  partnership	withMohanlal,  Chhotelal  and  Bansilal.   The  erstwhile  jointfamily of which they were members not being a partner in thenew  firm,  it	having	ceased to exist	 by  reason  of	 thepartition,  there  was, having regard to the  definition  insection	 2(17)	of  the Act, a change  in  the	persons	 whocarried	 on  the  business.   That was	the  view  taken  inShanmugavel  Nadar  and	 Sons V.   Commissioner	 of  Income-tax(1),	 and  we  agree with it.  Whether  the	question  isconsidered  on	the  principles	 of  Hindu  law	 or  on	 theprovisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act, there was a changein  the personnel of the firm on 17-10-1944, and the  matterfalls within section 8(1) of the Act.(2) The next question for determination is whether the orderof  the Commissioner dated 153-1950 is not justified by	 theprovisions  of	section 20 of the Act for  the	reason	thatthere was no mistake apparent from the record.	The argumentin support of this conten-(1)  [1948]16 I.T.R. 355,152tion  is  that	the record in the Excess  Profits  Tax	pro-ceedings  consisted  in the present case of only  the  orderdated  23-12-1946, that the facts on which  the	 proceedingswere taken under section 20, namely, the constitution of thefirm on 23-8-1940 and the changes effected therein on 17-10-1944  were  not recited therein, and that,  in	consequence,there  were no materials on which an order could  have	beenpassed under that section.  It is true that the order of theExcess Profits Tax Officer dated 23-12-1946 does not mentionthese facts, but they appear from the record of the  income-tax proceedings which included the registration certificatesof the firm under section 26-A of the Income-tax Act and thereturns	 made  by  the	firm disclosing	 the  names  of	 thepartners and their respective shares.  It is argued for	 theappellant  that	 these	records were  inadmissible  for	 thepurpose of proceedings under section 20 of the Act,  becausethe record referred to and contemplated by that section mustbe  the	 record of the excess profits tax  proceedings,	 andthat the records of the income-tax proceedings could not  beused  under that section.  We are unable to agree with	thiscontention.  Section 22(1) of the Act provides that:  "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian  Income-tax Act, 1922, all information contained in any statement orreturn made or furnished under the provisions of that Act orobtained  or collected for the purposes of that Act  may  beused for the purposes of this Act".  Section  22(2)  similarly makes the record of	 the  excessprofits tax proceedings admissible in proceedings under	 theIndian	Income-tax  Act.  The fact is that  the	 proceedingsunder  the two Acts are interdependent.	  Assessments  underthe  Excess  Profits  Tax Act are, subject  to	the  specialprovisions of that Act, made on the basis of the assessmentsmade under the provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act.	 Thesame  officers are in chargev of the proceedings under	boththe enactments.	 The order of the Excess Profits Tax Officerdated  23-12-1946 refers in terms to the order	dated  28-9-1946 passed in the proceedings for assess-153ment  of income-tax on the appellant, and the deficiency  ofprofits is worked out on the basis of the loss of Rs. 15,771as  ascertained	 therein.   We	see  no	 substance  in	thiscontention, which must accordingly be rejected.  It  was finally contended that the particulars recited  inthe registration certificate as to who were all partners  ofthe firm were not conclusive, and that the appellant was notestopped  from	proving	 that even  on	23-8-1940  the	realpartners  were	all the five persons mentioned in  the	deeddated  17-10-1944, and the decision in Shapurji Pellonji  v.Commissioner  of Income-tax(1) was relied on in	 support  ofthe  position.	 It  is undoubted law  that  the  income-taxauthorities  are  not estopped by the fact  of	registrationfrom going behind the certificate, and deciding who the realpartners  of  the  firm are.  But  can	the  assessee  whosestatement is the basis on which the registration is made andwho   has   possibly  been  benefited	thereby	  deny	 itscorrectness,  when the facts mentioned therein turn  out  tohis disadvantage?  It is unnecessary to consider this point,in view of our decision that on the facts as pleaded by	 theappellant,  Chhotelal and Bansilal could not be regarded  aspartners  in the old firm.  We may add that this  contentiondoes  not  appear  to  have  been  put	forward	 before	 theCommissioner  when notice was issued to the appellant  undersection	 20  of the Act.  If any such  contention  had	beenraised, it would have been open to the Commissioner to	havetaken action under section 19 of the Act.In  the	 result,  the appeal fails, and	 is  dismissed	withcosts.(1) [1945] 13 I.T.R. 118.154
