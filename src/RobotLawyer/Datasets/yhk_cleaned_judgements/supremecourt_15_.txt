K. Chatterjee, for the appellant.S.   P. Varma, for respondents Nos.  1 and 4.Nooni	Coomar	Chakravarti  and  B.  P.   Maheshwari,	 forrespondent No. 2.1960.  December 12.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyDAS  GUPTA,  J.-This appeal by special leave is	 against  anorder  of the High Court of Judicature at  Patna  dismissingsummarily an application of the present appellant under Art.226  and Art. 227 of the Constitution.	The appellant was  aworkman	 employed in the Digha factory of Bata Shoo  Company(Private)  Limited,  since October, 1943.   On	January	 13,1954,  the  management	of the company	served	him  with  acharge-sheet  alleging	that he had  been  doing  anti-unionactivities  inside the factory during the working hours	 andso  was guilty under section 12B(1) of the  Standing  Ordersand Rules of the company.  On198January 14, he submitted a written reply denying the  chargeand  asking  to be excused.  On January 15,  the  managementmade  an  order terminating his services  with	effect	fromJanuary 18, 1954.  An industrial dispute was raised on	thisquestion  of dismissal by the Union and was  referred  alongwith a number of other disputes to the Industrial  Tribunal,Bihar,	by  a  notification dated  April  29,  1955.   Afterwritten	  statements  were  filed  by  the  Union  and	 themanagement,  February  20, 1956, was fixed  for	 hearing  atPatna.	 Thereafter numerous adjournments were given by	 theTribunal  on the joint petition for time filed by  both	 theparties	 stating  that	all the disputes were  going  to  becompromised.   On  November 16, 1956, the Tribunal  made  anorder  fixing December 20, 1956, "for filing  compromise  orhearing".  On December 20, 1956, however a fresh applicationfor  time  was filed but it was stated	that  agreement	 hadalready been reached on some of the matters and	 opportunitywas  asked  for to settle the other matters.  The  case	 washowever	 adjourned  to	January	 21,  1957,  for  filing   acompromise or hearing.	On that date a further petition	 wasagain filed and a further extension of time was allowed tillFebruary 1, 1957.  On January 31, the parties, that is,	 themanagement   and  the  Union  filed  a	joint  petition	  ofcompromise settling all points of disputes out of court.Prior  to this, on January 12, 1957, the  present  appellanthad made an application praying that D. N. Ganguli and M. P.Gupta,	two of his co-workers might be allowed to  representhis  case  before the Tribunal instead of Fateh	 Singh,	 theSecretary of the Union and that he did not want his case  tobe  represented	 by Fateh Singh as he had no faith  in	him.This  application was dismissed by the Tribunal by an  orderdated  February 26, 1957.  On March 7, 1957,  the  appellantfiled  a fresh petition stating that he had  not  authorisedFateh  Singh  to enter into any agreement in  his  case	 andpraying	 that  the agreement filed in respect  of  his	caseshould not be accepted and that he and his agents should  beheard before the disposal199of the case.  This prayer was not allowed by the.   Tribunaland  by an order dated March 11, 1957, an award in terms  ofthe petition of compromise was made.The appellant filed his application to the Patna High  Courton  March 13, 1957, praying for an issue of  an	 appropriatewrit or direction quashing the Tribunal's order of  February26, 1957, by which the Tribunal had rejected his prayer	 forrepresentation	by  a person of his own choice in  place  ofFateh Singh, the Secretary of the Union.  Prayer was made inthis  petition also for a direction on the Tribunal  not  torecord	the  compromise	 in  so far as	it  related  to	 theappellant's case and to give its award without reference  tothe  settlement	 and on proper adjudication of	the  matter.The High Court dismissed this application summarily.  It  isagainst	 that order of dismissal that the present appeal  byspecial leave has been preferred.On  behalf of the appellant it is argued that  the  Tribunalcommitted a serious error in rejecting his application to berepresented  by a person of his own choice instead of  FatehSingh,	the Secretary of the Union and thereafter in  makingan  award  on  the basis of the reference.   It	 has  to  benoticed that on the date the application *as made before theHigh  Court  the award had already been made  and  so  therecould  be no direction as prayed for on the Tribunal not  tomake the award.	 If however the appellant's contention	thatthe Tribunal erred in rejecting his application for separaterepresentation	was sound he would have been entitled to  anorder	giving	him  proper  relief  on	 the   question	  ofrepresentation as well as regarding the award that had	beenmade.The   sole  question  that  arises  for	 our   determinationtherefore is whether the appellant was entitled to  separaterepresentation in spite of the fact that the Union which hadespoused his cause was being repre. sented by its Secretary,Fateh  Singh.  The appellant's contention is that he  was  aparty to the dispute in his own right and so was entitled torepresentation	according to his own liking.   The  questionwhether	 when a dispute concerning an individual workman  istaken up by the Union, of which the workman is a member, as200a  matter affecting workmen in general and on that  basis  areference  is  made under the Industrial  Disputes  Act	 theindividual  workman can claim to be heard  independently  ofthe  Union is undoubtedly of some importance.  The  questionof  representation of a workman who is a party to a  disputeis dealt with by section 36 of the Industrial Disputes	Act.That section provides that such a workman is entitled to  berepresented  in	 any  proceeding under the Act,	 by  (a)  anofficer of a registered trade union of which he is a member,(b) an officer of a federation of trade unions to which	 thetrade  union of which he is a member is affiliated  and	 (c)where  the  workman concerned is not a member of  any  tradeunion  by an officer of any trade union concerned  with	 theindustry, or by any other workman employed in that industry.The  appellant was the member of a trade union; and  he	 wasactually represented in the proceedings before the  Tribunalby  an	officer of that Union, its Secretary,  Fateh  Singh.The Union through this officer, filed a written statement onhis behalf.  Upto January 12, 1957, when the appellant filedhis  application for separate representation, this  officer,was in charge of the conduct of the proceedings on behalf ofthe  appellant.	  Never	 before	 that  date,  the  appellantappears to have raised any objection to this representation.The  question  is, whether, when thereafter he	thought	 hisinterests  were being sacrificed by his	 representative,  hecould  claim to cancel that representation, and claim to  berepresen. ted by somebody else.	 In deciding this  question,we  have  on  the one hand to  remember	 the  importance  ofcollective  bargaining in the settlement of industrial	dis-putes,	and on the other hand, the principle that the  partyto  a dispute should have a fair hearing.  In assessing	 therequirements  of this principle, it is necessary and  properto  take  note	also of the fact  that	when  an  individualworkman	 becomes a party to a dispute under  the  IndustrialDisputes  Act he is a party, not independently of the  Unionwhich has espoused his cause.It is now well-settled that a dispute between an  individualworkman and an employer cannot be an			    201industrial  dispute  as	 defined  in  section  2(k)  of	 theIndustrial Disputes Act unless it is taken up by a Union  ofthe  workmen  or by a considerable number  of  workmen.	  InCentral Provinces Transport Service Ltd. v. Raghunath  GopalPatwardhan  (1) Mr. Justice Venkatarama Ayyar  speaking	 forthe  Court pointed out after considering numerous  decisionsin  this matter that the preponderance of  judicial  opinionwas clearly in favour of the view that a dispute between  anemployer  and  a  single employee  cannot  per	se  be	anindustrial  dispute but it may become one if it is taken  upby  an Union or a number of workmen.  "Notwithstanding	thatthe  language  of  section  2(k) is  wide  enough  to  coverdisputes,  between  an	employer  and  a  single  employee",observed  the learned Judge, "the scheme of  the  IndustrialDisputes  Act does appear to contemplate that the  machineryprovided  therein  should be set in motion  to	settle	onlydisputes which involve the rights of workmen as a class	 andthat  a dispute touching the individual rights of a  workmanwas not intended to be the subject of adjudication under theAct,  when the same had not been taken up by the Union or  anumber of workmen".This view which has been re-affirmed by the Court in severallater  decisions recognises the great importance  in  modernindustrial life of collective bargaining between the workmanand the employers.  It is well known how before the days  ofcollective bargaining labour was at a great disadvantage  inobtaining reasonable terms for contracts of service from hisemployer.   As	trade unions developed in  the	country	 andcollective bargaining became the rule the employers found itnecessary and convenient to deal with the representatives ofworkmen,  instead  of individual workmen, not only  for	 themaking	or  modification of contracts but in the  matter  oftaking	disciplinary action against one or more workmen	 andas regards all other disputes.The  necessary	corollary  to this is  that  the  individualworkman	 is  at no stage a party to the	 industrial  disputeindependently of the Union.  The Union or those(1)[1954] S.C.R. 956.26202workmen	 who have by their sponsoring turned the  individualdispute	 into an industrial dispute, can therefore claim  tohave  a	 say in the conduct of the  proceedings	 before	 theTribunal.It is not unreasonable to think that s. 36 of the IndustrialDisputes Act recognises this position, by providing that theworkman who is a party to a dispute shall be entitled to  berepresented  by	 an officer of a registered trade  union  ofwhich  he is a member.	While it will be unwise	 and  indeedimpossible to try to lay down a general rule in the  matter,the  ordinary  rule  should  in our  opinion  be  that	suchrepresentation	by  an	officer of the	trade  union  shouldcontinue throughout the proceedings in the absence of excep-tional	circumstances  which  may justify  the	Tribunal  topermit	other representation of the workman  concerned.	  Weare  not satisfied that in the present case, there were	 anysuch exceptional circumstances.	 It has been suggested	thatthe  Union's  Secretary	 Fateh Singh himself  had  made	 thecomplaint against the appellant which resulted in the  orderof dismissal. it has to be observed however that in spite ofeverything,  the  Union did take up  this  appellant's	caseagainst his dismissal as its own.  At that time also,  FatehSingh was the Secretary of the Union.  If are Union had	 nottaken up his cause, there would not have been any reference.In view of all the circumstances, we are of opinion, that itcannot	be  said that the Tribunal committed  any  error  inrefusing  the appellant's prayer for representation  throughrepresentatives	 of  his own choice in preference  to  FatehSingh, the Secretary of the Union.As  a last resort, learned counsel for the appellant  wantedto urge that the Secretary of the Union had no authority  toenter  into any compromise on behalf of the Union.  We	findthat  no  such	plea  was taken	 either	 in  the  appellantsapplication before the Tribunal or in his application  underArts.  226  and 227 of the Constitution to the	High  Court.Whether	  in  fact  the	 Secretary  had	 any  authority	  tocompromise is a question of fact which cannot be allowed  tobe raised at this stage.203In  the	 application before the High Court a  statement	 wasalso  made that the compromise was collusive and mala  fide.The  terms  of the compromise of the dispute  regarding	 theappellant's   dismissal	  were	that  he   would   not	 getreemployment, but by way of "humanitarian considerations thecompany agreed without prejudice to pay an ex-gratia  amountof Rs. 1,000/- (Rupees one thousand) only" to him.  There isno material on the record to justify a conclusion that	thiscompromise was not entered in what was considered to be	 thebest interests of the workman himselfIn  our opinion, there is nothing that would justify  us  ininterfering  with the order of the High Court rejecting	 theappellant's   application  for	a  writ.   The	 appeal	  isaccordingly dismissed.	There will be no order as to costs.During the hearing Mr. Chakravarty, learned counsel for	 thecompany,  made a statement on behalf of the company that  inaddition  to  the  sum of Rs. 1,000 which  the	company	 hadagreed	to pay to the appellant as a term of settlement	 thecompany	 will  pay  a further sum of Rs.  500  (Rupees	fivehundred)  only	ex-gratia and without prejudice.   We  trustthat  this statement by the counsel will be honoured by	 thecompany.Appeal dismissed204
