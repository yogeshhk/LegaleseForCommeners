Thejurisdiction' over this area was originally exercised by theGovernor-General  in Council by virtue of an agreement	withthe  Maharaja of Mysore, and the income-tax  law  applicablewas the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.  On July 26, 1947,	 theretroceded  area was given back to the State of	 Mysore	 butthe income-tax law in force in that area prior to that	datecontinued  to  have effect and be operative  till  June	 30,1948,  on which date was promulgated the  Mysore  Income-taxAct  and Excess Profits Tax (Application to  the  RetrocededArea)  (Emergency) Act, 1948, the effect of which  was	thatthe  Indian  Income-tax Act, 1922, stood  repealed  and	 theMysore	Income-tax  Act, 1923, came into  force	 subject  tocertain	  saving  provisions.	On  August  5,	 1948,	 waspromulgated  the Retroceded Area (Application of Laws)	Act,1948.	Between	 1947  and 1950	 there	were  political	 andconstitutional	changes which ultimately resulted in  Mysorebecoming  a Part B State within the Constitution  of  India.The  legal effect of these changes was that  the  income-taxlaw  applicable to the retroceded area till June  30,  1948,was the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 ; from July 1, 1948, theMysore	Income-tax Act, 1923, became applicable except	thatthe  Indian Income-tax Act continued to apply in respect  ofthe total income chargeable to income-tax in the  retrocededarea  prior to July 1, 1948, and the provisions of that	 Actas  in	force  in the retroceded area  prior  to  that	dateapplied	 to  all proceedings relating to the  assessment  ofsuch  income upto the stage of assessment and  determinationof income-tax payable thereon.	This position continued tillApril  1, 1950, when the Finance Act, 1950, came into  forceand  as	 a result the Indian Income-tax	 Act,  1922,  becameapplicable  again  to the retroceded area,  subject  to	 thesaving provisions of s. 13(1) of the former Act.  In respectof the assessment for the four years between 1945 and  1949,the respondent was assessed to income-tax under the law thenin force in that area; subsequently, in 1954 the  Income-taxOfficer served a notice on the respondent under s. 34 of theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, for the purpose of assessing  "escaped " or " under-assessed " income chargeable to income-tax  for  the  said years.  The	 respondent  challenged	 thejurisdiction  of the Income-tax Officer to take	 proceedingsunder  S.  34 or to make an order of  re-assessment  on	 thegrounds	 inter alia (1) that s. 34 Of the Indian  Income-taxAct,  1922,  was not saved by s. 13(1) of the  Finance	Act,1950,  because	what was saved was the prior law "  for	 thepurposes  of the levy, assessment and collection of  income-tax  ",	 which	expression  did	 not  include  re-assessmentproceedings, (2) that the787financial agreement made between the President of India	 andthe  Rajpramukh of Mysore dated February 28, 1950,  renderedthe impugned proceedings unconstitutional and void, (3) thatthe  Indian  Income-tax	 Act,  1922,  as  in  force  in	 theretroceded  area  stood repealed on June 30,  1948,  by	 theMysore	Income-tax  and Excess Profits (Application  to	 theRetroceded  Area)  (Emergency)	Act, 1948,  and	 the  savingprovisions  in s. 5(b) thereof or in para (2), sub-para	 (b)of Sch.	 A to the Retroceded Area (Application of Laws) Act,1948,  did  not	 save s. 34 in so far as  it  permitted	 re-assessment  proceedings in respect of years in	which  therehad been an assessment already, and (4) that after June	 30,1948, and until April 1, 1950, the Income-tax Officer in theretroceded area could re-open the assessment under s. 34  Ofthe  Mysore  Income-tax Act, 1923, within a period  of	fouryears  specified therein, but there was no authority to	 re-open  the  assessment under s. 34 Of the  Indian  Income-taxAct.Held  :	 (1)  that the expression  "  levy,  assessment	 andcollection  of income-tax " in s. 13(1) Of the Finance	Act,1950,	was   wide  enough   to	  comprehend   re-assessmentproceedings under s. 34 Of the Indian Income-tax Act,  1922,and  that the financial agreement between the  President  ofIndia  and the Rajpramukh of Mysore, on a true	constructionof the recommendations of the Indian States Finance  EnquiryCommittee,   did   not	render	the   impugned	 proceedingsunconstitutional or void ;Lakshmana  Shenoy  v.  The  Incomc-tax	Officer,  Ernakulam,[1959] S.C.R. 751, followed.(2)  that the saving provisions in the Mysore Income-tax andExcess	 Profits  (Application	to  the	  Retroceded   Area)(Emergency) Act, 1948, and the Retroceded Area	(Applicationof  Laws)  Act, 1948, made the prior law  available  in	 allcases  in  which the income was assessed or  was  assessableaccording  to that law before July 1, 1948, and,  therefore,they  saved s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act,	 1922,	withregard to re-assessment proceedings ;City  Tobacco Mart and Others v. Income-tax  Officer,  UrbanCircle, Bangalore, A.I.R. 1955 Mys. 49, overruled.Hirjibhai  Tribhuwandas v. Income-tax  Officer,	 Rajnandgaonand another, A.I.R. 1957 M. P. 171, approved.(3)  that  the Income-tax Officer had the authority  to	 re-open the assessments in the present case because the  periodof  limitation	was that laid down in s. 34  of	 the  IndianIncome-tax  Act, as it was in force in the  retroceded	areaprior to July 1, 1948.JUDGMENT:CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos.165-168  of1956.Appeals from the judgment and order dated March 22, 1955, ofthe Mysore High Court in Writ Petitions Nos. 20 to 22 and 25of 1954.788H.

Choudhury   and	  G.Gopalakrishnan, for the respondent.1958.  April 28.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered byS.K.  DAS  J.-These four appeals brought by  the  Income-taxOfficer, Special Circle, Bangalore, on a certificate grantedby the High Court of Mysore, are from the judgment and orderof  the	 said High Court dated March 22, 1955, by  which  itquashed	  certain  proceedings	initiated,  and	 orders	  ofassessment  made,  against  the respondent  assesse  in	 thematter of reassessment of income-tax for the years  1945-46,1946-47, 1947-48, and 1948-1949.The  relevant  facts  are  these.   The	 respondent  K.	  N.Guruswamy  was carrying on business as an excise  contractorin the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore,	 hereinaftercalled	the retroceded area, in Mysore.	 He was assessed  toincome-tax for each of the four years mentioned above  underthe law then in force in the retroceded area by the  Income-tax  Officer having jurisdiction therein.  For	1945-46	 theoriginal assessment was made on February 12,1946, for  1946-47 on January 21, 1949, for 1947-48 on January 22, 1949, andfor  1918-49  also sometime in the year 1949.	The  tax  soassessed was duly paid by the assessee.	 On January 5, 1954,more than four years after, the Income-tax Officer,  SpecialCircle, Bangalore, served a notice on the assessee under  s.34  of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, for the	 purpose  ofassessing what was described as escaped' or 'under-assessed'income	chargeable  to income-tax for the said	years.	 Theassessee  appeared  through his auditors and  contested	 thejurisdiction  of the Income-tax Officer to issue the  noticeor make a re-assessment under s. 34 of the Indian Income-taxAct,  1922.   On February 19, 1954, the	 Income-tax  Officeroverruled the assessee's objection, and made a re-assessmentorder  for  the	 year 1945-46.	On February  25,  1954,	 theassessee filed four writ petitions in the Mysore High  Courtin789which  he  challenged  the jurisdiction	 of  the  Income-taxOfficer to take proceedings under s. 34 or to make an  orderof   re-assessment  in	such  proceedings;  he	asked,	 forappropriate orders or writs quashing the pending proceedingsfor three years and the order of re-assessment for  1945-46.During	the  pendency of the cases in the  High	 Court,	 theIncome-tax Officer was permitted to make an assessment orderfor  1946-47, subject to the condition that if the  assesseesucceeded in establishing that the Income-tax Officer had nojurisdiction,  that order would also be quashed.   The	HighCourt  heard  all the four petitions together,	and  by	 itsjudgment  and order dated March 22, 1955, allowed  the	writpetitions and quashed the proceedings in assessment as	alsothe two orders of reassessment, holding that the  Income-taxOfficer	 had no jurisdiction to initiate the proceedings  orto  make  the  orders of  re-assessment.   The	High  Court,however,  granted a certificate that the cases were fit	 forappeal	to  this  Court, and these four	 appeals  have	beenbrought	 on that certificate.  Before us, the  appeals	havebeen heard together and will be governed by this judgment.For  a	clear understanding and appreciation of	 the  issuesinvolved  in these appeals, it is necessary to set  out,  inbrief  outline,	 the political	and  constitutional  changeswhich  the retroceded area has from time to time  undergone;because	 those	changes had  important	legal  consequences.Under the Instrument of Transfer executed sometime in  1881,when  there  was installation of the Maharaja of  Mysore  bywhat has been called " the rendition of the State of  Mysore",  the Maharaja agreed to grant to the Governor-General  inCouncil such land as might be required for the establishmentand maintenance of a British cantonment and to renounce	 alljurisdiction  therein.	 Pursuant  to  that  agreement,	 theretroceded  area  was  granted to  the	Governor-General  inCouncil, and jurisdiction therein was exercised by virtue ofpowers	given by the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order  inCouncil,  1902,	 made under the	 Foreign  Jurisdiction	Act,1890.	The laws administered in the area  included  variousenactments made applicable thereto from time to790time  by  the promulgation of notifications made  under	 theaforesaid  Order in Council, and one of such enactments	 wasthe Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.The year 1947 ushered in great political and  constitutionalchanges	 in India, which affected not merely what  was	thencalled	British	 India but also the Indian States,  such  asMysore etc.  The Indian Independence Act, 1947, brought intoexistence two independent Dominions, India and Pakistan,  asfrom  August  15, 1947.	 The Act,  however,  received  Royalassent on July 18, 1947.  Section 7 set out the consequencesof  the	 setting  up  of the two  new  Dominions:  one	suchconsequence was that the suzerainty of His Majesty over	 theIndian	States	lapsed,	 and with it  lapsed  all  treaties,agreements  etc.,  between  His Majesty and  the  rulers  ofIndian	States, including all powers, rights,  authority  orjurisdiction  exercisable by His Majesty in an Indian  Stateby treaty, grant, usage, suffrage etc.In  view of the aforesaid provision-perhaps in	anticipationof  it, the retroceded area was given back to the  State  ofMysore on July 26, 1947 by a notification Made by the  CrownRepresentative under the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Orderin  Council,  1937.  This did not, however,  mean  that	 theMysore laws at once came into force in the retroceded  area.On August 4, 1947, the Maharaja of Mysore enacted two  laws:the  Retrocession (Application of Laws) Act 1947, being	 ActXXIII	of   1947,  and	  the	Retrocession   (TransitionalProvisions) Act, 1947 being Act XXIV of 1947.  The  combinedeffect	of  these laws was this: all laws in  force  in	 theretroceded area prior to the the date of retrocession, whichwas July 26, 1947, continued to have effect and be operativein the retroceded area (vide s. 3 of Act XXIII of 1947)	 andthe  Mysore  officers were given jurisdiction to  deal	withproceedings  under  the laws in force prior to the  date  ofretrocession (see s. 12 of Act XXIV of 1947).  This state ofaffairs	 continued  till June 30, 1948, on  which  date	 waspromulgated  the  Mysore Income-tax and Excess	Profits	 Tax(Application to the Retroceded Area) (Emergency) Act,  1948,being Act XXXI of 1948.	 Section 3 of this Act said-791"Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in section  3  ofthe Retrocession (Application of Laws) Act, 1947,(i)  the Mysore Income-tax Act, 1923, and(ii) the Mysore Excess Profits Tax Act, 1946,except	sub-section (4) of section 2, and all rules,  ordersand  notifications made or issued tinder the aforesaid	Actsand  for the time being in force shall with effect from	 thefirst  day of July, 1948, and save as otherwise provided  inthis  Act,  take effect in the Retroceded Area to  the	sameextent and in the same manner as in the rest of Mysore."Section 6 said-" Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Indian  Income-tax  Act,  1922, and the Excess Profits Tax  Act,  1940,  ascontinued  by  the Retrocession (Application of	 Laws)	Act,1947, are hereby repealed."The  repeal of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, effected  bys. 6 aforesaid, was subject to other provisions of Act	XXXIof  1948, and one such provision which is material  for	 thedispute	 before	 us  was contained in  s.  5,  the  relevantportion whereof was in these terms-"  S.  5.

On August  5,1948,  was promulgated the Retroceded Area  (Application  ofLaws) Act, LVII of 1948, which came into effect from  August15,  1948.   Sections  3  and 4 of Act	LVII  of  1948,	 arematerial for our purpose and may be quoted-"S. 3. Except as hereinafter in this Act provided,-(3) all laws in force in Mysore shall apply to theRetroceded Area; and(b)the	laws  in force in the  Retroceded  Area	 immediatelybefore	the  appointed day shall not, from  that  day,	haveeffect or be operative in the Retroceded Area,.""

It read-" 2.

The Maharaja of Mysore had acceded  tothe  Dominion  of  India in 1947;  this,  however,  did	 notempower	 the Dominion legislature to impose any tax or	dutyin  the	 State	of  Mysore  or	any  part  thereof.   By   aproclamation dated November 25, 1949, the Maharaja of Mysoreaccepted the Constitution of India, as from the date of	 itscommencement,	as   the  Constitution	of   Mysore,   whichsuperseded and abrogated all other constitutional provisionsinconsistent  therewith	 and  in force	in  the	 State.	  OnJanuary 26, 1950, the Constitution of India came into force,and Mysore became a Part B State within the Constitution  ofIndia.	 On  February  28,  1950,  there  was  a   financialagreement between the Rajpramukh of Mysore and the Presidentof  India in respect of certain	 matters governed  by  Arts.278,  291, 295 and 306 of the Constitution.  Under Art.	 277of  the Constitution, however, all taxes  which	 immediatelybefore	the  commencement  of the  Constitution	 were  beinglevied	 by   the   State  continued  to   be	so   levied,notwithstanding that those taxes were mentioned in the UnionList, until provision to the contrary was made by Parliamentby  law.   Such law was made by the Finance  Act,  1950,  bywhich  the  whole of Mysore including  the  retroceded	areabecame	"  taxable  territory " within the  meaning  of	 theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, from April 1, 1950, and the794Indian	 Income-tax  Act  again	 came  into  force  in	 theretroceded area from the aforesaid date.  Section 13 of	 theFinance	 Act, 1950, dealt with repeals and savings.  As	 thetrue  scope and effect of sub-s. (1) of s. 13 is one of	 thequestions at issue before us, it is necessary to read it." If immediately before the 1st day of April, 1950, there isin force in any Part B State other than Jammu and Kashmir orin  Manipur,  Tripura or Vindhya Pradesh or  in	 the  mergedterritory  of CoochBehar any law relating to  income-tax  orsuper-tax or tax on profits of business that law shall ceaseto have effect except for the purposes of the levy,  assess-ment  and collection of income-tax and super-tax in  respectof  any	 period not included in the previous  year  for	 thepurposes  of  assessment under the  Indian  Income-tax	Act,1922, for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1951, orfor  any subsequent year, or, as the case may be, the  levy,assessment and collection of the tax on profits of  businessfor any chargeable accounting period ending on or before the31st day of March, 1949:Provided  that any reference in any such law to an  officer,authority,  tribunal  or  court	 shall	be  construed  as  areference to the corresponding officer, authority,  tribunalor court appointed or constituted under the said Act, and ifany  question arises as to who such  corresponding  officer,authority, tribunal or court is, the decision of the CentralGovernment thereon shall be final.,"Now, the legal effect of the constitutional changes referredto above, so far as it has a bearing on the present dispute,may be briefly summarised as follows: the Indian  Income-taxAct,  1922,  remained in force in the retroceded  area	tillJune  30,  1948 ; from July 1, 1948, the  Mysore  Income-taxAct,  1923, applied, subject to this saving that the  IndianIncome-tax  Act continued to apply in respect of  the  totalincome chargeable to income tax in the retroceded area priorto July 1, 1948, and the provisions of that Act as in  forcein  the	 retroceded area prior to that date applied  to	 allproceedings relating to the assessment of such income795upto the stage of assessment and determination of income-taxpayable	 thereon.   This position continued  till  April  1,1950,  when the Finance Act, 1950, came into force  and	 theIndian	Income-tax Act, 1922, again came into force  in	 theretroceded area, subject to the saving mentioned in s. 13(1)thereof.The principal question before us, as it was before the	HighCourt,	is one of jurisdiction.	 Did the Income tax  Officerconcerned have jurisdiction to issue the notice under s.  34of  the	 Indian	 Income-tax  Act, 192  and  to	make  a	 re-assessment  order  pursuant to sue notice ? The	 High  Courtpointed	 out that though the notice did not clearly say	 so,the  Income-tax	 Officer clearly acted under s.	 34  of	 theIndian	Income-tax  Act,  1922, as it was in  force  in	 theretroceded  area  prior	 to  July  1,  1948,  and  the	writapplications were decided on that footing.The  four  main lines of argument on  which  the  respondentassessee  rested his contention that the  Incometax  Officerconcerned  had no jurisdiction were these : firstly, it	 wasurged  that s. 34 of the Indian Incomtax Act, 1922, was	 notsaved by s. 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, because what wassaved  was  the prior law " for the purposes  of  the  levy,assessment and collection of income-tax ", which  expressiondid not include re-assessment proceedings; secondly, it	 wasargueed	 that, even otherwise, the financial agreement	madebetween the President of India and the Rajpramukh of  Mysoreon February 28, 1950, which received constitutional sanctityin  Art.  278  of the  Constitution  rendered  the  impugnedproceedings  unconstitutional  and  void;  thirdly,  it	 wassubmitted that the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, as in  forcein  the retroceded area stood repealed on June 30, 1948,  byMysore	Act  XXXI of 1948, and the saving provisions  in  s.5(b)  thereof  or in paragraph (2),  sub-paragraph  (b),  ofSchedule A to Mysore Act LVII of 1948, did not save s. 34 inso far as it permitted re-assessment proceedings in  respectof years in which there had been an assessment already;	 andlastly, it was contended that after June 30, 1948, and untilApril 1, 1950, the Income-tax Officer in the retroceded areacould re-open796the  assessment	 under s. 34 of the  Mysore  Incometax	Act,1923,  within a period of four years specified therein,	 butthere was no authority to re-open the assessment under s. 34of the Indian Income-tax Act.Following its own decision, City Tobacco Mart and Others  v.Income-tax Officer, Urban Circle, Bangalore (1), on  certainearlier	 writ petitions (nos. 52 and 53 of 1953 and 105	 and106 of 1954), the High Court held in favour of the  assesseeon  the construction of s. 13 (1) of the Finance  Act,	1950and also oil the effect of the saving provisions in s. 5 (b)of Mysore Act XXXI of 1948, and paragraph (2), sub-paragraph(b)  of	 Schedule A to Mysore Act LVII of  1948.   On  thesefindings, it held that the Income-tax Officer concerned	 hadno  jurisdiction  or authority to start	 the  impugned	pro-ceedings  or to make the impugned orders of assessment.	  Itdid not feel called upon to pronounce on the validity of theargument  founded on the financial agreement dated  February28, 1950.In Civil Appeals 143-145 of 1954, Civil Appeals 27 to 30  of1956 and Civil Appeals 161 to 164 of 1956, Lakshmana  Shenoyv. The Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam (2), in which  judgmenthas  been  delivered  today, we have  fully  considered	 thearguments as to the true scope and effect of s. 13(1) of theFinance	 Act,  1950,  and  of  the  financial  agreement  ofFebruary  28, 1950, taken along with the recommendations  ofthe Indian States Finances, Enquiry Committee.	We have heldtherein	  that	the  expression	 I  levy,   assessment	 andcollection  of	income-tax in s. 13 (1) is  wide  enough  tocomprehend  re-assessment proceedings under s. 34  and	thatthe financial agreement aforesaid, on a true construction ofthe  recommendations  of  the Enquiry  Committee,  does	 notrender	the impugned proceedings Unconstitutional and  void.That decision disposes of these two arguments in the presentappeals.The  two  additional points which remain  for  considerationdepend	on  the	 interpretation	 to be	put  on	 the  savingprovisions  in	s.  5(b)  of Mysore Act	 XXXI  of  1948	 andparagraph (2), sub-paragraph (b) of Schedule(1) A.I.R. 1955 MYS. 49.(2) [1959] S.C.R. 751.797A  to  Mysore  Act  LVII  of  1948.   These  provisions	 areexpressed  in identical terms, and the question is  if	theysave  s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act with regard to	 re-assessment  proceedings.   We  think that they	do.   It  isworthy	of  note  that the saving provisions  say  that	 theIndian	Income-tax Act, 1922, as in force in the  retrocededarea  prior to July 1, 1948, shall apply in respect  of	 thetotal income chargeable to income tax prior to that date andit shall apply to proceedings relating to the assessment  ofSuch income, until the stage of assessment and determinationof  income-tax	payable thereon.  'Total income'  means	 thetotal  amount of income, profits and gains computed  in	 themanner	laid down in the Act, and there are no good  reasonswhy the word 'assessment' occurring in the saving provisionsshould	be  restricted	in the manner  suggested  so  as  toexclude	 proceedings  for assessment of	 escaped  income  orunder-assessed	income.	  On  behalf  of  the  assessee	 ourattention  has	been drawn to the words "in respect  of	 thetotal income chargeable to income-tax............ but  whichhas  not  been assessed until that date " occurring  in	 thesaving provisions and the argument is that, those words showthat   there  was  no  intention  to  permit  reopening	  ofassessments  which had been made already.  We are unable  toaccept	this  argument.	 In its normal sense, I	 to  assess'means  'to  fix	 the  amount of tax  or	 to  determine	suchamount'.   The	process	 of re-assessment  is  to  the	samepurpose	 and  is included in the connotation of the  term  "assessment   ".	 The  reasons  which  led  us  to   give   acomprehensive  meaning to the word " assessment " in  s.  13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, operate equally with regard tothe saving provisions under present consideration.  We agreewith the view expressed in Hirjibhai Tribhuvandas v. Income-tax Officer, Rajnandgaon and another (1), that s. 34 of	 theIncome	_tax Act contemplates different cases in  which	 thepower  to assess escaped income has been given; where  therehas been no assessment at all, the, term " assessment "	 maybe  appropriate and where there was assessment at too low  arate or with(1)  A.I.R. 1957 M.P. 171.798unjustified  exemptions,  the  term  re-assessment'  may  beappropriate,  and  it  may have been necessary	to  use	 twodifferent  terms to cover with clarity the  different  casesdealt with in the section ; but this does not mean that	 thetwo  terms should be treated as mutually exclusive  or	thatthe  word  'assessment' in the saving provisions  should  begiven  a  restricted  meaning.	The  object  of	 the  savingprovisions was obviously to make the prior law available  inall cases in which the income was assessed or was assessableaccording  to  that  law  before July 1,  1948,	 and  it  isdifficult  to  see  why	 only  a  part	of  the	 process  ofassessment should be saved and the other part repealed.We, therefore, hold that the saving provisions save s. 34 ofthe Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, in its entirety, as it	 wasin  force in the retroceded area prior to July 1, 1948,	 andthe contention of the respondent that it stood repealed fromthat  date is not correct.  As to the period of	 limitation,it  would  be the period laid down in s. 34  of	 the  IndianIncome-tax  Act	 as it was in force in the  retroceded	areaprior to July 1, 1948.The result, therefore, is that these appeals succeed and thejudgment  and order of the High Court of Mysore dated  March22, 1955, are set aside and the writ petitions filed by	 therespondent  assessee are dismissed.  The appellant will	 gethis costs in this Court and the High Court.Appeals allowed.799
