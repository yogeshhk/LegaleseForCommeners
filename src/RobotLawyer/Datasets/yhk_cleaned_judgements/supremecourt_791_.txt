The appellant instituted a suit inthe  court  of the Subordinate Judge of	 Kakinada,  for	 therecovery  of  the amount due on the mortgage,  dated  14-12-1911, and prayed for sale of the hypotheca.  The respondentswere  impleaded as defendants but did not appear.  The	suitwas  decreed ex parte, and in execution of the	decree,	 theproperties of the respondents, mortgaged to A on  19-7-1909,were  brought to sale, and purchased by	 the  decree-holder.The  respondents  then instituted the present  suit  in	 theDistrict Court of East Godavari which then bad	jurisdictionover  the  properties in suit, for a  declaration  that	 thedecree	 obtained  by  the  appellant  was  fraudulent	 andinoperative  and could not affect their title.	 The  plaintwas later on amended and a prayer added that the  propertiesmight  be  partitioned and the respondents put	in  separatepossession  of their share.  The trial Judge  dismissed	 thesuit and the District Court in appeal affirmed his decision.Before the High Court in second appeal it was contended	 forthe first time that the decree in question did not direct  asale  of  the mortgaged properties but a sale of  the  mort-gagee's	 rights under the mortgage deed dated 19-7-1909	 andas such the sale of the properties was void.  The High Courthaving	called for a finding from the District Court  as  towhat was sold, it was939found  by that Court that the decree bad really	 directed  asale  of  the mortgagee's rights and not of  the  propertiesmortgaged  and that there was excessive execution.  It	was,however,  of opinion that the point should have	 been  takenbefore	the  executing court and the suit in so	 far  as  itclaimed	 relief	 on  the basis of  excessive  execution	 wasbarred under s. 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The HighCourt declined to entertain the objection that the suit	 wasbarred	under s. 47 as it had not been taken in the  writtenstatement  and	was  raised for the  first  time  in  secondappeal, and decreed the respondent's suit.  It was contendedfor   the  appellant  that  the	 High  Court   should	haveentertained  the  objection and held that the  suit  was  sobarred.Held,  that the appellant should be permitted to  raise	 thecontention.   The point relating to excessive execution	 hadnever been specifically raised except before the High  Courtand  the allegations in the plaint were vague  and  obscure.It  is	a  pure question of law which  requires	 no  furtherinvestigation  of  facts and was understood and	 debated  assuch by the parties before the District Court.That  it  was  well settled that  the  question	 whether  anexecution  sale was in excess of the decree and,  therefore,not  warranted by it could be raised as between the  partiesonly  by an application under s. 47 of the Code	 before	 theexecuting court and not by a separate suit.J.

Chaudhury and Naunit Lal, with him) forthe appellant.K.   S.	 Krishnaswamy Aiyangar, (K.  R.	 Krishnaswamy,	withhim) for respondents Nos.  I to 4.1955.	November 4. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyVENKATARAMA  AYYAR  J.-This is an appeal  by  special  leaveagainst	 the judgment of the Madras High Court in  a  secondappeal which reversed the concurrent judgments of the courtsbelow, and granted a decree941in favour of the respondents for partition and possession of126 acres 33 cents out of a parcel of land of the extent  of503 acres 18 cents in the village of Kalavacherla and of  10acres  12 cents out of a parcel of land of the extent of  40acres  47  cents  in the village of  Nandarada,	 with  mesneprofits,  past	and future.  All these lands  measuring	 543acres 65 cents were purchased by five co-sharers on 5-6-1888under  two  sale deeds, Exhibits P and P-1.   One  of  theseshares of the extent of about 218 acres was, at the materialdates, held in common by two brothers, Rangaraju and Kumara,the former owning 136 acres 45 cents and the latter 81 acres45  cents.  On 19-8-1908 Kumara executed a simple  mortgage,Exhibit	 Q, over 81 acres 45 cents belonging to him for	 Rs.1,000  in  favour of Nallapparaju, who	with  his  undividedbrother, Achutaramaraju, held a share in the two parcels  ofland aforesaid in Kalavacherla and Nandarada.  On  19-7-1909both  Rangaraju and Kumara executed a mortgage,	 Exhibit  A,for  Rs. 2,000 over all the 218 acres belonging to  them  infavour of Achutaramaraju.  On 4-6-1910 Kumara again  createda mortgage over 81 acres 45 cents belonging to him,  ExhibitQ-1  for Rs. 2,500 in favour of Achutaramaraju.	  On  14-12-1911  Achutaramaraju executed a mortgage for Rs.  14,000  infavour	 of  one  Merla	 Agastayya,  Exhibit  C,  over	 theproperties which he held in full ownership as co-sharer, andalso  the mortgage right which he held over  the  propertiesbelonging  to Rangaraju and Kumara under the three  mortgagedeeds, Exhibits Q, A and Q-1.  On 29-8-1920 Kumara sold	 the81  acres  45 cents belonging to him and  comprised  in	 themortgages aforesaid to Achutaramaraju for Rs. 11,000 as	 perExhibit	 G,  and thereby the two deeds, Exhibits Q  and	 Q-1became completely discharged and Exhibit A to the extent  ofthe  half  share  of Kumara.  The  position  then  was	thatAchutaramaraju became the owner of 81 acres 45 cents out  ofthe  properties mortgaged under Exhibit A, and continued  tobe  a  simple mortgagee as regards the rest of them  to	 theextent of half the amount due therein.	By virtue of section70 of the Transfer of942Property  Act, the sale under Exhibit G would enure for	 thebenefit	  of  the  mortgagee,  Merla  Agastayya,  being	  anaccession to the interest of his mortgagor.On 20-1-1924 the representatives of Merla Agastayya assignedtheir  interests in the mortgage, Exhibit C, to the  presentappellant, who instituted O.S. No. 25 of 1927 on the file ofthe  court of the Subordinate Judge of Kakinada	 to  recoverthe   amount   due  thereon  by	 sale  of   the	  hypotheca.Achutaramaraju, the mortgagor, and the members of his familywere  defendants I to 4 in that suit.  Kumara was  impleadedas  the	 14th  defendant  and  Rangaraju  and  his  son	  asdefendants  15 and 16.	In the plaint, it was  alleged	thatthe  properties comprised in the mortgage deed,	 Exhibit  C,consisted  of the properties belonging to the mortgagors  infull ownership as co-sharers and also of the mortgage  rightunder  Exhibits Q, A and Q-1.  Then there was an  allegationthat  defendants  I  to	 4  had	 themselves  purchased	 themortgaged   properties	"towards  discharge  of	 the   firstdefendant's  mortgage debts".  As a statement of fact,	thiswas not accurate, because the purchase by Achutaramaraju wasonly  of 81 acres 45 cents belonging to Kumara and  the	 re-maining	 properties continued to be held by  Rangaraju,	 andAchutaramaraju was only a mortgagee thereof under Exhibit A.There were the further allegations that defendants 14 to  16were impleaded as parties because they were in possession ofthe properties, and that they were the predecessors-in-titlein  respect  of the properties which  were  mortgaged  underExhibits  Q, A and Q-1.	 Then there was the  general  prayerfor the sale of the properties.The mortgagors, defendants 1 to 4, entered into a compromisewith  the  plaintiff,  while defendants 14  to	16  remainedexpert.	  On 31-1-1931 the suit was decreed in terms of	 thecompromise  as	against defendants I to 4 and  ex  parte  asagainst	 defendants 14 to 16, and a final decree was  passedon 6-11-1932.  On 23-8-1934 the decree-holder filed E.P. No.99  of 1934 praying for the sale of the hypotheca  includingthe properties mentioned in Exhibit A. Defendants 15 and  16then intervened, and filed an objection to943their  being sold on the ground that the mortgage  had	beendischarged in 1923, and that the exparte decree against themhad  been  obtained  fraudulently.   This  application	 wasrejected  by  the  Subordinate Judge on	 26-8-1935,  and  anappeal against this order to the High Court, Madras was alsodismissed on 1-9-1938.	Meanwhile, 163 acres 18 cents out ofthe properties mortgaged under Exhibit A, of which 81  acres86-1/2 cents belonged to Rangaraju, were brought to sale  onthe  14th and 15th April 1936, and purchased by the  decree-holder	himself.  The sale was confirmed on  26-6-1936,	 andpossession  taken on 15-12-1936.  But before possession	 wastaken, on 14-12-1936 Rangaraju and his sons instituted	O.S.No. 268 of 1936 in the District Munsif's court,	 Rajahmundryfor a declaration that the decree in O.S. No. 25 of 1927 hadbeen  obtained fraudulently, and that the decree-holder	 wasnot  entitled  to execute the decree as against	 their	pro-perties.  An objection was taken to the jurisdiction of	 thecourt  of  the	District  Munsif  to  try  this	 suit,	 andeventually,  the plaint was returned to be presented to	 theproper	court.	Thereupon, they instituted on  7-8-1939	 thepresent	 suit,	O.S.  No.  39 of 1939 on  the  file  of	 theDistrict  Court,  East Godavari for a declaration  that	 thedecree	in 0. S. No. 25 of 1927 was obtained by	 suppressingservice	 of  summons, and was therefore void and  could	 notaffect	their  title  to  136  acres  45  cents	 which	weremortgaged  under Exhibit A. The suit was transferred to	 thecourt  of  the	Subordinate Judge of  Rajahmundry,  and	 wasnumbered as O.S. No. 79 of 1946.In  his	 written statement, the appellant  denied  that	 thedecree in O.S. No. 25 of 1927 was obtained fraudulently, andcontended  that the present suit was barred  by	 limitation.He  also pleaded that as he had purchased the properties  inexecution of the decree and obtained possession thereof, thesuit  which was one for a bare declaration that	 the  decreewas void and inexecutable was not maintainable.	 It must  bementioned that while 81 acres 86-1/3 cents of land belongingto Rangaraju and his sons had been sold on the 14th and 15thApril 1936, their remaining properties of the944extent	of 54 acres 58-1/2 cents were sold after the  insti-tution of O.S. No. 268 of 1936 in the court of the  DistrictMunsif,	 Rajahmundry.  In view of the objections  aforesaid,the  plaintiffs amended the plaint by adding a	prayer	that136 acres 45 cents out of the total of 543 acres 65 cents inschedule  A and belonging to them might be  partitioned	 andput in their separate possession.The  Subordinate Judge of Rajahmundry dismissed the suit  onthe ground that no fraud had been established, and that	 thesuit was barred by limitation in so far as it sought to	 setaside  the  decree on the ground of fraud.   The  plaintiffsappealed against this judgment to the District Court of EastGodavari,  which  by  its judgment  dated  16th	 March	1945affirmed   the	decree	of  the	 Subordinate   Judge.	 Theplaintiffs then preferred Second Appeal No. 1826 in the HighCourt, Madras.	There, for the first time the contention waspressed	 that the decree in O.S. No. 25 of 1927 on its	trueconstruction  directed	a sale only of the  mortgage  rightswhich Achutaramaraju had over the A schedule properties, andthat  the sale of the properties themselves in execution  ofthat decree was in excess of what the decree bad  directed.,and  was  therefore  void,  and	 that  the  plaintiffs	wereaccordingly   entitled	to  recover  possession	  of   thoseproperties  ignoring  the sale.	 Satyanarayana Rao,  J.	 whoheard  the  appeal,  construed the  plaint  as	sufficientlyraising	 this  question and issue (2) (b) as  covering	thiscontention,  and accordingly directed the District Judge  toreturn	a finding on the question as to whether the sale  ofthe  properties	 was warranted by the terms of	the  decree.The  District Judge of East Godavari to whom this issue	 wasreferred, held that the decree directed the sale of only themortgage rights of Achutaramaraju under Exhibit A. and	thatthe sale of the properties themselves was not in  accordancewith  the  decree.   But he further held that  this  was  anobjection  relating  to the execution of  the  decree  whichcould be agitated only before the executing court, and	thata  separate  suit with reference to that matter	 was  barredunder section 47, Civil945Procedure Code.	 On this finding, the second appeal came  upfor  final disposal before Satyanarayana Rao, J. who  agreedwith the District Judge that the sale of the properties	 wasnot  authorised by the decree, and was therefore void.	 Buthe  declined  to entertain the objection that the  suit	 wasbarred	by section 47, Civil Procedure Code, on	 the  groundthat it had not been taken in the written statement, and wasa  new contention preferred for the first time at the  stageof  second appeal.  In the result,, he granted a decree	 forpartition  and	delivery of 136 acres 45 cents	out  of	 theproperties  mentioned in schedule A to the  plaintiffs,	 andmesne profits, past and future.	 Against this judgment,	 thedefendant  prefers the present appeal, and insists that	 thesuit  is  liable to be dismissed as barred  by	section	 47,Civil Procedure Code.On behalf of the appellant, it was contended by Mr.  Somayyathat  the question whether having regard to section  47	 thesuit  was maintainable was argued before the  learned  Judgebefore	he called for a finding, and that it ought  to	havebeen  therefore considered on the merits, and that,  in	 anyevent, as it was a pure question of law and went to the rootof the matter, it ought to have been entertained.  On behalfof  the	 respondents, Mr.  Krishnaswami	 Iyengar  vehementlycontends that as the objection to the maintainability of thesuit  based  on	 section 47 was not  taken  in	the  writtenstatement,  the	 learned Judge had a discretion	 whether  heshould	permit the point to be raised for the first time  insecond appeal or not, and that we should not interfere	withthe  exercise  of that discretion in  special  appeal.	 Thebasis  on  which the suit has now been decreed is  that	 thedecree	in 0. S. No. 25 of 1927 properly construed  directedonly  a sale of mortgage rights under Exhibit A and  not  ofthe properties, but it must be conceded that this point doesnot distinctly emerge on the face of the plaint.  It is truethat  there are allegations therein which might be  read  ascomprehending that question, but they are vague and elusive,and  what is more, this contention was not argued either  inthe court of the946Subordinate Judge of Rajahmundry or in the District Court ofEast  Godavari,	 and it is only in second  appeal  that	 thequestion appears to have been first thought of in this form.Though	we are not prepared to say that the  allegations  inthe  plaint are not. sufficient to cover this point, we	 areof the opinion that they are so obscure that it is  possiblethat the appellant might have missed their true import,	 andomitted to plead in answer thereto that the suit was  barredby section 47.	Apart from this, it is to be noted that thispoint  does  not involve any fresh investigation  of  facts.Indeed,	 when  the matter was before the District  Judge  inpursuance  of  the  order of the High Court  calling  for  afinding, counsel on both sides understood it as involving  adecision  on this point as well, and the argument  proceededon the footing that it was a pure question of law  involvingno  further enquiry on facts.  We have	therefore  permittedthe appellant to raise this contention.Mr. Somayya for the appellant does not challenge the findingof  the District Court confirmed by the High Court that	 thedecree	directed  only the sale of the	mortgage  rights  ofAchutaramaraju	under  Exhibit A, but he contends  that	 thesale in execution of that decree of not merely the  mortgagerights under Exhibit A but of the properties themselves	 wasexcessive  execution against which the	judgment-debtor	 wasentitled  to obtain relief by application to  the  executioncourt, and that a separate suit with reference thereto wouldbe  barred  under section 47, Civil Procedure Code.   It  iswell  settled that when a sale in execution of a  decree  isimpugned on the ground that it is not warranted by the termsthereof,  that	question could be agitated, when  it  arisesbetween parties to the decree, only by an application  undersection 47, Civil Procedure Code and not in a separate suit.In  J.	Marret v. Md.  K. Shirazi & Sons(1) the	 facts	werethat  an  order was made by the execution  court  directing,contrary  to the terms of the decree, payment of  a  certainfund to the decree-holder.  A separate suit(1)  A.I.R. 1930 P.C. 86.947having	been instituted by the judgment-debtor for  recoveryof  the	 amount on the ground that the payment	was  not  inaccordance with the decree, it was held by the Privy Councilthat  the  action  was	barred under  section  47.   A	casedirectly  in  point is Venkatachalapathy  Aiyen	 v.  PerumalAiyen(1).   There, the suit was to enforce a mortgage  whichrelated	 both  to  properties  held  in	 ownership  by	 themortgagor and mortgage rights held by him.  In execution  ofthe decree passed therein, the properties themselves and notmerely	the mortgage rights were sold.	The  judgment-debtorthen sued for a declaration that what was sold was only	 themortgage right and to recover possession of the	 properties.It  was held that such a suit was barred under	section	 47.Vide  also  the decisions in Biru Mahata  v.  Shyama  CharanKhawas(2), Abdul Karim v. Islamunnissa Bibi(3) and  Lakshmi-narayan v. Laduram(4).	The position is, in our opinion, toowell settled to be open to argument, and it must accordinglybe  held that the present suit is barred under	section	 47,Civil Procedure Code.That,  however, does not conclude the matter.	Section	 47,clause	(2)  enacts  that "the Court  may,  subject  to	 anyobjection   as	to  limitation	or  jurisdiction,  treat   aproceeding  under  this	 section as a suit or a	 suit  as  aproceeding...........  Under this provision, this Court	 hasthe  power to treat the plaint presented on 7-8-1939  as  anapplication  under section 47 provided that on that date  anapplication  for  the  relief  claimed	was  not  barred  bylimitation, and provided further that the court in which  itwas  filed  was	 competent to execute the  decree.   On	 thequestion of limitation, the relevant dates are the 14th	 and15th,  April 1936, when 81 acres 861 cents belonging to	 theplaintiffs were sold, and 15th December 1936 when possessionwas  taken thereof through court.  As regards the  remainingproperties, the exact date on which they were, sold does notappear	on the record, but it is sufficient for the  presentpurpose	 that it was subsequent to the institution  of	O.S.No. 268 of 1936 on  2,0.4(1)  [1912] M.W.N. 44.(2)  [1895] I.L.R. 22 Cal. 483.(3)  [1916] I.L.R. 38 All. 339.(4)  [1931] A.I.R. 1932 Bom. 96. 120948the file of the District Munsif's court, Rajahmundry,  whichwas  on	 14-12-1936.  Now, the point  for  determination  iswhether	 the  plaint was barred by limitation  either  underarticle 165 or article 166 of the Indian Limitation Act,  ifit is treated as an execution application presented. on 7-8-1939, or whether it was in time under article 181.Under  article 165, an application by a person	dispossessedof  immovable  properties  and disputing the  right  of	 thedecree-holder or purchaser at an execution,sale to be put inpossession  must be filed within 30 days  of  dispossession.If   this   is	the  article  applicable  to   the   presentproceedings, then it must be held that the plaint treated asan execution application was filed out of time.	 In  VachaliRohini v. Kombi Aliassab(1), a Full Bench of the Madras HighCourt  has  held, dissenting from the  view  previously	 ex-pressed	 in  Ratnam Aiyar v. Krishna Doss Vital	 DSS(2)	 andfollowing  Abdul Karim v. Mt.  Is amunnissa Bibi  (3),	thatthis article applies only to applications for being restoredto  possession	by persons other than  judgment-debtors,  asunder  Order  XXI, rule 100, Civil Procedure Code  and	thatapplications  by  judgmentdebtors  claiming  relief  on	 theground	that their properties had been erroneously taken  inexecution  of the decree are not governed by it.  This	viewwas  approved and followed in Rasul v. Amina (4)  and  BahirDas  v. Girish Chandra(1).  We are of the opinion  that	 thelaw has been correctly laid down in the above decisions, andthat  in accordance therewith, the present  proceedings	 arenot barred by article 165.Coming	next to article 166, an application by	a  judgment-debtor	to  set aside a sale in execution of a	decree	has,under that article, to be filed within 30 days of the  sale.If  the	 present proceedings are governed by  this  article,there can be no question that they are barred by limitation.But  then,  there  is abundant authority  that	article	 166applies only when the sale is one which has under the law tobe  2,0.4(1)  [1919] I.L.R. 42 Mad. 753.(2)  [1897] I.L.R. 21 Mad. 494.(3)  [1916] I.L.R. 38 All. 339(4)  [1922] I.L R. 46 Bom. 1031.(5)   [1922) A.I.R. 1923 Cal. 287.949set  aside as for example, under Order XXI, rules  8990	 and91,  but  that	it  has no  application	 when  the  sale  isinoperative and void.  In Seshagiri Rao v. Srinivasa Rao(1),the  appellant was a party to the -suit, but the decree	 hadexonerated him from liability.	In execution of the  decree,his three-fourths' share in the properties was sold on 26-1-1910  and  purchased  by the  decree-holder  and  possessiondelivered to him on 16-12-1910.	 The appellant then filed  asuit  on 25-7-1911 to set aside the sale on the ground	thatit  was in contravention of the decree and  therefore  void.An  objection  having been taken by the defendant  that	 thesuit was barred under section 47, the court, while upholdingthe  same,  held  that the plaint could	 be  treated  as  anapplication  under  that  section if it was in	time  as  anexecution  application, and the question arose for  decisionwhether	 the  application  was governed by  article  166  orarticle 181 of the Indian Limitation Act.  It was held that-as the sale was a nullity, it had not to be set aside  underthe  law, and therefore the article applicable	was  article181 and not article 166.  This statement of the law was	 ap-proved	by  a  Full  Bench  of	the  Madras  High  Court  inRajagopalier  v.  Ramanujachariar.  A similar  decision	 wasgiven  in, Manmothanath Ghose v. Lachmi Devi(1), wherein  itwas  observed by Page, J. that the sale being void need	 nothave  been set aside at all, and the order to be passed	 was"in  substance merely a declaration that the sale  was	nulland of no effect".  The question whether an application by ajudgmentdebtor	for setting aside a sale on the ground	thatthere  was  excessive  execution and that the  sale  of	 hisproperties  was in consequence void was governed by  article166  or	 article 181 came up directly for  consideration  inNirode	Kali Roy v. Harendra Nath(1).  In holding  that	 theapplication  was governed by article 181, B.  K.  Mukherjea,J.,  (as  he then was) observed that "article  166  must  beconfined  to cases where the sale is voidable only  and	 notvoid when the execution sale is a nullity, if a party  filesan application under(1)  [1919] I.L.R. 48 Mad. 813.(2)  [ 1928] I.L.R. 47 Mad. 288.(3)  [1927] I.L.R. 55 Cal 96.(4)  I.L.R. [1938] 1 Cal. 280,950section 47 to have it pronounced a nullity or for setting itaside  for safety's sake to avoid future  difficulties,	 theproper	article would be article 181 and not article 166  ofthe Indian Limitation Act".  The decisions in Seshagiri	 Raov.  Srinivasa Rao(1) and Rajagopalier v.  Ramanujachariar(2)were  again  followed in Ma We Gyan v.	Maung  Than  Byu(3),wherein it was held that if the execution sale was void,  itwas  not necessary for the applicant to have it	 set  aside,and  that  even if there was such a prayer, that  would	 notaffect	the real nature of the application which was  really"for  an order directing the respondent to deliver  propertyon  the	 ground that there was no valid sale".	 We  are  inagreement with these decisions, and hold that when a sale inexecution  is  inoperative  and void, an  application  by  ajudgment-debtor to have it declared void and for appropriatereliefs is governed by article 181 and not article 166.	  Onthe findings of the courts below that the decree in O.S. No.25  of 1927 properly construed authorised only the  sale  ofthe  mortgage rights of Achutaramaraju under Exhibit  A	 andnot  the  lands	 which	were  the  subject-matter  of	thatmortgage,  the	respondents were entitled to  apply  to	 thecourt  for delivery of possession of the properties  wronglysold   through	process	 of  court  and	 delivered  to	 theappellant,  and	 such an application would  be	governed  byarticle 181.Then, there is the further question whether applying article181, the plaint presented on 7-8-1939 was within time  underthat  article.	As already stated, 81 acres 581	 cents	weresold on the 14th and 15th April 1936.  If the starting pointof  limitation	is the date of -sale, then  the	 applicationmust  be held to be barred, -unless the period during  whichthe  suit was pending in the court of the  District  Munsif,Rajahmundry,  is  deducted under section 14  of	 the  IndianLimitation  Act.  But if limitation is to be  reckoned	fromthe  date  of  dispossession,  then  the  application  wouldclearly	 be in time.  Under article 166, an  application  toset aside a sale must be presented within 30 days thereof.(1) [1919] I.L.R. 43 Mad. 313.(2) (1923] I.L.R. 47 Mad. 288.(3) A.I.R. 1937 Rang. 126.951But  if the sale in question was void, and for	that  reasonarticle 166 becomes inapplicable, then the date of the	salemust  vanish as the starting point of limitation, as it	 hasno  existence in law.  It is not until the purchaser  actingunder colour of sale interferes with his possession that theperson whose properties have been sold is really  aggrieved,and what gives him right to apply under article 181 is	suchinterference or dispossession and not the sale.	 As observedin  Ma We Gyan v. Maung Than Byu(1), such an application  isreally	one  for an order for redelivery of  the  propertieswrongly	 taken -possession of by the purchaser.	 If that  isthe correct position, the right to apply arises by reason ofdispossession  and not of sale, and the starting  point	 forlimitation  would be the date of dispossession.	 It  was  soheld in Chengalraya v. Kollapuri(2).  There, the  propertiesof a party to the suit who had been exonerated by the decreewere  sold  in	execution of that  decree  on  8-1-1918	 andpurchased by the decree-holder.	 It was found that lie	tookactual possession of the properties in 1919.  On  23-11-1921the representatives in interest of the exonerated  defendantcommenced   proceedings	 to  recover  possession   ,of	 theproperties  from the decree-holder purchaser on	 the  groundthat the sale under which he claimed was void.	It was	heldthat the proper article of limitation applicable was article181, and that time commenced to run under that article	fromthe  date not of sale but of actual dispossession, and	thatthe  proceedings  were accordingly in time.  We	 agree	withthis  decision, and hold that an application by a  party  tothe suit to recover possession of properties which had	beentaken  delivery of under a void execution sale would  be  intime  under article 181, if it was filed within three  yearsof   his  dispossession.   Therefore,  there  is  no   legalimpediment to the plaint filed on 7-8-1939 being treated  asan  application under section 47, on the ground that  it  isbarred by limitation.The  next question for consideration is whether the  presentsuit was filed in a court which had jurisdiction to  executethe decree in O. S. No. 25 of 1927.(1) A.I.R. 1937 Rang. 126.(2) A.I.R. 1930 mad. 12.952That  was  a  decree  passed by	 the  Subordinate  Judge  ofKakinada, whereas the present suit was filed in the DistrictCourt,	East Godavari to which the court of the	 SubordinateJudge  of  Kakinada  is	 subordinate.	Section	 38,   CivilProcedure Code provides that a decree may be executed eitherby the court which passed it or by the court to which it  issent for execution.  The District Court of East Godavari  isneither the court which passed the decree in O.S. No. 25  of1927 nor the court to which it had been sent for  execution.But  it	 is  common ground that when the  present  suit	 wasinstituted  in	the District Court, East  Godavari,  it	 hadjurisdiction  over  the properties, which are  the  subject-matter of this suit.  It is true that by itself this is	 notsufficient  to make the District Court of East Godavari	 thecourt  which  passed the decree for purpose of	section	 38,because	 under section 37, it is only when the	court  whichpassed the decree has ceased to have jurisdiction to executeit  that the court which has jurisdiction over the  subject-matter	when the execution application is presented  can  beconsidered as the court which passed the decree.  And it  issettled law that the court which actually passed the  decreedoes  not lose its jurisdiction to execute it, by reason  ofthe subject-matter thereof being transferred subsequently tothe  jurisdiction  of another court.  Vide  Seeni  Nadan  v.Muthuswamy  Pillai(1)  Masrab Khan v.  Debnath	Mali(1)	 andJagannath v. Ichharam(3).  But does it follow from this thatthe  District  Court, East Godavari has no  jurisdiction  toentertain the execution application in respect of the decreein  O.S.  No.  25  of  1927  passed  by	 the  court  of	 theSubordinate Judge, Kakinada?There  is  a long course of decisions in the High  Court  ofCalcutta that when jurisdiction over the subjectmatter of  adecree	is transferred to another court, that court is	alsocompetent  to entertain an application for execution of	 thedecree.	  Vide Latchman v. Madan Mohun (4), Jahar v.  KaminiDevi(1)	 and  Udit  Narayan v. Mathura	Prasad(6).   But  inRamier v.  2,0.3(1)  [1919] I.L.R. 42 Mad. 821.	 F.B.(2)  I.L.R. [1942] 1 Cal. 289.(3)  A.1 R. 1925 Bom. 414.(4)  [1880] I.L.R. 6 Cal. 513.(5) [1900]   28 Cal, 238.(6)  [1908] I.L.R. 35 Cal. 974.953Muthukrishna Ayyar(1), a Full Bench of the Madras High Courthas taken a different view, and held that in the absence  ofan  order of transfer by the court which passed the  decree,that court alone can entertain an application for  executionand  not the court to whose jurisdiction the  subject-matterhas  been  transferred.	  This	view  is  supported  by	 thedecision  in  Masrab  Khan v. Debnath Mali(1).	 It  is	 notnecessary in this case to decide which of these two views iscorrect, because even assuming that the opinion expressed inRamier v. Muthukrishna Ayyar(1) is correct, the present caseis governed by the principle laid down in Balakrishnayya  v.Linga  Rao(1).	It was held therein that the court to  whosejurisdiction the subject-matter of the decree is transferredacquires  inherent jurisdiction over the same by  reason  ofsuch transfer, and that if it entertains an execution appli-cation	with reference thereto, it would at the worst be  anirregular assumption of jurisdiction and not a total absenceof  it, and if objection to it is not taken at the  earliestopportunity,  it  must be deemed to have  been	waived,	 andcannot	be  raised at any later stage  of  the	proceedings.That precisely is the position here.  We have held that	 theallegations in the plaint do raise the question of excessiveexecution,  and	 it was therefore open to the  appellant  tohave raised the plea that the suit was barred by section 47,and  then, there could have been no question of waiver.	  Wehave,  it  is  true, permitted the appellant  to  raise	 thecontention  that the present suit is barred by	section	 47,and  one of the reasons therefor is that the allegations  inthe plaint are so vague that the appellant might have missedtheir true import.  But that is not a sufficient ground	 forrelieving him from the consequence which must follow on	 hisfailure to raise the objection in his written statement.  Weagree  with the decision in Balakrishnayya v. Linga  Rao(,),and  hold  that the objection to the District  Court  enter-taining an application to execute the decree in 0. S. No. 25of 1927 is one that could be waived and not(1)  [1932]  I.L.R. 55 Mad. 801.(2) I.L.R. [1942] 1 Cal. 289.(3) I.L.R. [1943] Mad. 804.954having	been  taken  in the written  statement	is  not	 nowavailable  to the appellant.  There is thus no legal bar  toour treating the plaint presented by the respondents on 7-8-1939  as an execution application under section 47,  and  inthe  interests	of justice, we direct it to be	so  treated.But this should be on terms.  We cannot ignore the fact thatit is the gross negligence of the respondents at all  stagesthat  has been responsible for all the troubles.   They	 didnot  appear in the suit, and put forward their rights  underExhibit	 A. They intervened at the stage of  execution,	 buttheir complaint was mainly that the ex parte decree had beenobtained  by  fraud, a plea which has  now  been  negatived.Even in this suit. they did not press the plea on which theyhave succeeded until they came to the High Court.  Under thecircumstances,	we think it -just that they should  be	dep-rived of all claims for mesne profits down to this date.In  the	 result,  treating  the plaint	as  I  an  executionapplication,  we  direct that the  properties  mentioned  inschedule A to the plaint be partitioned and the	 respondentsput  in	 possession of 126 acres 33  cents  in	Kalavacherlavillage	 and  of 10 acres 12 cents in Nandarada	 village  inproceedings  to	 be taken in execution of this	order.	 Therespondents  will  be  entitled to their share	of  the	 netincome	attributable  to 136 acres 45 cents  aforesaid	fromthis date down to the date on which they are put in separatepossession thereof.Subject to the modification of the decree of the court belowas  stated  above, this appeal will  stand  dismissed.	 Theparties will, however, bear their own costs throughout.955
