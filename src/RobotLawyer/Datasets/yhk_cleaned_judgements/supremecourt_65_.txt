The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyWANCHOO,  J.-This is an appeal on a certificate	 granted  bythe Punjab High Court.	Sharda Singh (hereinafter called therespondent)  was in the service of the appellant-mills.	  OnAugust	28,  1956, the respondent was transferred  from	 thenight  shift to the day shift in accordance with para  9  ofthe Standing Orders governing the workmen in the  appellant-mills.	At that time an industrial dispute was pending	bet-ween  the appellant-mills and their workmen.   The  transferwas to take effect from August 30, 1956; but the  respondentfailed	to report for work in the day shift and	 was  markedabsent.	  On September 1, 1956, he submitted an	 applicationto  the General Manager to the effect that he  had  reportedfor  duty on August 30, at 10-30 p.m. and had worked  duringthe  whole night, but had not been marked present.   He	 hadagain  gone to the mills on the night of August 31, but	 wasnot  allowed  to  work	on  the	 ground	 that  he  had	beentransferred  to	 the day shift.	 He complained that  he	 hadbeen dealt with arbitrarily in order to harass him.   Thoughhe said that he had no objection to carrying out the orders,he requested the manager to intervene and save him from	 thehigh-handed action taken against him, adding that the  millswould  be responsible for his wages for the days he was	 notallowed to work.On  September  4,  1956,  he  made  an	application  to	 theindustrial tribunal, where the previous dispute was pending,under  s.  33-A of the Industrial Disputes Act, No.  XIV  of1947,  (hereinafter called the Act) and complained  that  hehad  been transferred without any rhyme or reason  from	 oneshift to another and that this amounted to alteration in theconditions  of	his  service,  which  was  prejudicial	 anddetrimental  to his interest.  As this alteration  was	madeagainst	 the provisions of s. 33 of the Act, he	 prayed	 fornecessary  relief  from	 the tribunal  under  s.  33-A.	  OnSeptember 5, 1956, the General Manager replied to the letterof  September 1, and told the respondent that  his  transferfrom. one shift to the other had been ordered on592August	28, and he had been told to report for work  in	 theday  shift from August 30; but instead of obeying the  orderwhich  was made in the normal course and report for work  asdirected  he  had  deliberately	 disobeyed  the	 order	 andreported  for work on August 30 in the night shift.  He	 wasthen ordered to leave and report for work in the day  shift.He  however  did not even then report for work	in  the	 dayshift and absented himself intentionally and thus  disobeyedthe order of transfer.	The General Manager therefore calledupon  the respondent to show cause why	disciplinary  actionshould	not be taken against him for wailfully	refusing  toobey  the lawful orders of the departmental officers and  hewas  asked to submit his explanation within 48	hours.	 Therespondent submitted his explanation on September 7, 1956.Soon after it appears the appellant-mills received notice ofthe application under s. 33-A and they submitted a reply  ofit  on October 5, 1956.	 Their case was that  transfer	fromone shift to another was within the power of the  managementand  could not be said to be an alteration in the terms	 andconditions  of service to the prejudice of the	workman	 andtherefore the complaint under s. 33-A was not  maintainable.The appellant-mills also pointed out that a domestic inquirywas being held into the subsequent conduct of the respondentand prayed that proceedings in the application under s. 33-Ashould	be stayed till the domestic inquiry  was  concluded.No  action seems to have been taken on this complaint  unders.  33-A,  for which the appellant-mills might as  they	 hadprayed for stay However, the domestic inquiry continued	 andon February 25, be partly responsible of those	proceedings.against	 the respondent 1957, the inquiry  officer  reportedthat  t	 e charge of misconduct was  proved.  Thereupon	 theGeneral	 Manager passed an order on March 5, 1957,  that  inview of the serious misconduct of the respondent and lookinginto  his  past records, he should be dismissed; but  as  anindustrial  dispute  was pending then, the  General  Managerordered	 that  the  permission of  the	industrial  tribunalshould be taken before the order of dismissal was593passed	and an application should be made for  seeking	suchpermission under s. 33 of the Act.In the meantime, a notification was issued on March 1, 1957,by  which  10th March, 1957, was fixed for the	coming	intoforce of certain provisions of the Central Act, No. XXXVI of1956, by which ss. 33 and 33-A were amended.  The  amendmentmade a substantial change in s. 33 and this change came intoeffect	from March 10, 1957.  The change was that the  totalban  on the employer against altering any condition of	ser-vice to the prejudice of workmen and against any action	 formisconduct was modified.  The amended section provided	thatwhere  an employer intended to take action in regard to	 anymatter	connected  with	 the dispute or	 in  regard  to	 anymisconduct  connected with the dispute, he could only do  sowith  the  express permission in writing  of  the  authoritybefore	which the dispute was pending; but where the  matterin  regard  to which the employer wanted to take  action  inaccordance with the Standing Orders applicable to a  workmanwas  not  connected with the dispute or the  misconduct	 forwhich action was proposed to be taken was not connected withthe  dispute,  the  employer could take such  action  as  hethought	 proper,  subject  only	 to this  that	in  case  ofdischarge or dismissal one month's wages should be paid	 andan  application should be made to the tribunal before  whichthe  dispute  was pending for approval of the  action  takenagainst	 the  employee	by the employer.  In  view  of	thischange	in the law, the appellant-mills thought that as	 themisconduct  of	the respondent in the present case  was	 notconnected  with the dispute then pending adjudication,	theywere  entitled to dismiss him after paying him	one  month'swages and applying for approval of the action taken by them.Consequently,  no application was made to the  tribunal	 forpermission  in	accordance  with the order  of	the  GeneralManager	 of March 5, 1957, already referred to.	  Later,  onApril  2,  19579  an order of dismissal was  passed  by	 theGeneral	 Manager  after tendering one month's wages  to	 therespondent  and	 an application was made  to  the  authorityconcerned  for	approval  of the action	 taken	against	 therespondent.594Thereupon the respondent filed another application under  s.33-A  of  the Act on April 9, 1957, in which  he  complainedthat the appellant-mills had terminated his services withoutthe  express permission of the tribunal and that this was  acontravention  of  the provisions of s. 33 of  the  Act;  hetherefore  prayed for necessary relief.	 On April 18,  1957,an  interim  order  was	 passed	 by  the  tribunal  on	thisapplication  by	 which as a measure of interim	relief,	 theappellant  mills  were ordered to permit the  respondent  towork  with  effect  from April 19  and	the  respondent	 wasdirected  to report for duty.  It was also ordered  that  ifthe  management	 failed	 to take the  respondent  back,	 therespondent  would  be paid his full wages with	effect	fromApril  19 after he had reported for duty.  On May  6,  1957,however, the application dated April 9, 1957, was  dismissedas  defective  and therefore the interim order of  April  18also came to an end.  On the same day (namely, May 6, 1957),the  respondent	 made another application under s.  33-A  inwhich  he removed the defects and again complained that	 hisdismissal  on  April 2, 1957, without the  express  previouspermission of the tribunal was against s. 33 and prayed	 forproper relief.It  is this application which is pending at present and	 hasnot been disposed of, though more than three years have goneby.   It  is also not clear what has happened to  the  firstapplication  of	 September 4,1956, in which  the  respondentcomplained  that his conditions of service had been  alteredto his prejudice by his transfer from one shift to  another.Applications  under s. 33 and s. 33-A of the Act  should  bedisposed  of quickly and it is a matter of regret that	thismatter is pending for over three years, though the appellantmills  must also share the blame for this state of  affairs'However, the appellant-mills gave a reply on May 14,1957, tothe  last application under s. 33-A and objected that  therewas no breach of s. 33 of the Act, their case being that theamended	 s. 33 applied to the order of dismissal  passed  onApril 2, 1957.	Further, on the merits, the appellant-mills'case  was  that	 the  dismissal	 was  in  the  circumstancesjustified.595The matter came up before the tribunal on May 16, 1957.	  Onthis date, the tribunal again passed an interim order, whichwas  to the effect that as a measure of interim relief,	 therespondent  should be permitted to work from May 17 and	 therespondent was directed to report for duty.  It was  furtherordered that in case the management failed to take him back,they would pay him his full wages with effect from the	datehe reported for duty.Thereupon  the appellant-mills filed a writ petition  beforethe High Court.	 Their main contention before the High Courtwas  two-fold.	 In the first place it was  urged  that	 thetribunal  had  no jurisdiction to entertain  an	 applicationunder  s. 33-A of the Act in the circumstances of this	caseafter the amended sections 33 and 33-A came into force	fromMarch  10, 1957.  In the alternative it was  contended	thatthe tribunal had no jurisdiction to pass an interim order ofreinstatement  or in lieu thereof payment of full  wages  tothe respondent even before considering the questions  raisedin  the application under s. 33-A on the merits.   The	HighCourt  held on the first point that in view of s. 30 of	 theIndustrial Disputes (Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions)Act,  No. XXXVI of 1956, the present case would be  governedby  s. 33 as it was before the amendment and  therefore	 thetribunal would have jurisdiction to entertain the  complaintdated May 6, 1957, under s. 33-A of the Act.  On the  secondpoint,	the High Court held that the order of  the  tribunalgranting interim relief was within its jurisdiction and	 wasjustified.  In consequence, the writ petition was dismissed.Thereupon  the	appellant-mills applied and  was  granted  acertificate  by the High Court to appeal to this Court;	 andthat is how the matter has come up before us.The same two points which were raised in the High Court havebeen  urged  before us.	 We are of opinion that	 it  is	 notnecessary  in  the present case to decide  the	first  pointbecause	 we  have come to the conclusion  that	the  interimorder  of May 16, 1957, is manifestly erroneous in  law	 andcannot	be supported.  Apart from the question	whether	 thetribunal had jurisdiction596to pass an interim order like this without making an interimaward,	(a point which was considered and left open by	thisCourt in The Management of Hotel Imperial v. Hotel  Workers'Union  (1)),  we are of opinion that where the	tribunal  isdealing with an application under s. 33-A of the Act and thequestion  before  it  is whether an order  of  dismissal  isagainst the provisions of s. 33 it would be wrong in law forthe  tribunal to grant reinstatement or full wages  in	casethe employer did not take the workman back in its service asan interim measure.  It is clear that in case of a complaintunder  s. 33-A based on dismissal against the provisions  ofs.  33, the final order which the tribunal can pass in	caseit is in favour of the workman, would be for  reinstatement.That final order would be passed only if the employer  failsto  justify  the dismissal before the  tribunal,  either  byshowing	  that	proper	domestic  inquiry  was	held   whichestablished  the misconduct or in case no  domestic  inquirywas  held  by  producing evidence  before  the	tribunal  tojustify the dismissal: See Punjab National Bank Ltd. v. All-India Punjab National Bank Employees' Federation (2),  whereit  was held that in an inquiry under s. 33-A, the  employeewould  not  succeed in obtaining an order  of  reinstatementmerely	  by proving contravention of s. 33 by the employer.After such contravention is proved it would still be open tothe  employer  to  justify the	impugned  dismissal  on	 themerits.	  That is a part of the dispute which  the  tribunalhas  to consider because the complaint made by the  employeeis  to	be  treated as an industrial  dispute  and  all	 therelevant  aspects of the said dispute fall to be  consideredunder s. 33-A.	Therefore, when a tribunal is considering  acomplaint under s. 33-A and it has finally to decide whetheran  employee should be reinstated or not, it is not open  tothe  tribunal to order reinstatement as an  interim  relief,for  that would be giving the workman the very relief  whichhe  could  get	only  if on a trial  of	 the  complaint	 theemployer  failed  to justify the order	of  dismissal.	 Theinterim relief ordered in this case was that the work(1) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 476.(2) [1960] 1 S.C.R. 806.597man  should  be	 permitted to work: in other  words  he	 wasordered to be reinstated; in the alternative it was  orderedthat if the management did not take him back they should payhim  his full wages.  We are of opinion that such  an  ordercannot be passed in law as an interim relief, for that wouldamount to giving the, respondent at the outset the relief towhich  he would be entitled only if the employer  failed  inthe proceedings under s. 33-A.	As was pointed out in  HotelImperial's case (1),ordinarily, interim relief should not bethe  whole  relief  that  the  workmen	would  get  if	theysucceeded  finally.  The order therefore of the tribunal  inthis case allowing reinstatement as an interim relief or  inlieu  thereof payment of full wages is manifestly  erroneousand  must  therefore be set aside.  We therefore  allow	 theappeal, set aside the order of the High Court as well as  ofthe tribunal dated May 16, 1957, granting interim relief.Learned	 counsel for the respondent submitted to us that  weshould	grant  some interim relief in case we  came  to	 theconclusion  that  the order of the tribunal  should  be	 setaside.	 In the circumstances of this case we do  not  thinkthat   interim	relief	to  the	 respondent   is   justifiedhereafter.  As we have pointed above, applications under ss.33  and 33-A should be dealt with expeditiously.   We  trustthat the applications dated September 4, 1956, which appearsto  have  been overlooked and of May 6, 1957,  will  now  bedealt  with  expeditiously and finally disposed	 of  by	 thetribunal,  as all applications under s. 33-A should be.	  Inthe circumstances we pass no order as to costs.			      Appeal allowed.(1)  [1960] 1 S.C.R. 476.76598
