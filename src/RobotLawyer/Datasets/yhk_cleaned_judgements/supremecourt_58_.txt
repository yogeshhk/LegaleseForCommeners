TheDistrict  Magistrate  got  an  enquiry	made  by  the	Sub-Divisional  Magistrate	and forwarded the  report  toghetherwith  his own endorsement to the Superintendent	 of  Police.The  respondent was forced to go on 2 months leave  and	 wasreverted  to  his substantive post of  Head  Constable,	 butlater  he  was	promoted to the	 rank  of  officiating	Sub-Inspector  and posted at another police station.   Meanwhileon  further complaints an investigation was made and it	 wasreported that the respondent was a habitual bribe taker.  Hewas  charged under s. 7 Police Act for 9 charges of  briberyand   after   departmental  trial  was	dismissed   by	 theSuperintendent	of Police.  He filed a Writ Petition  beforethe High court challenging the order of dismissal inter aliaon  the	 ground that the offences charged  being  cognizableoffences the Superintendent of Police had no jurisdiction tohold the departmental trial without first complying with theprovisions of para. 486(1) of the U. P. Police	Regulations.The  High  Court accepted this contention  and	quashed	 theorder of dismissal.673Held  (per  Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.)  that	 thesubject matter of the magisterial enquiry and of the depart-mental trial was substantially the same and that the depart-'I  mental trial was validly held.  The fact that there	 wasan  interregnum	 between  the magisterial  enquiry  and	 thedepartmental  trial did not affect the question.   Paragraph486 did not apply to a case where a magisterial enquiry	 wasordered	 and a police officer could be departmentally  triedunder s. 7 Police Act after such magisterial enquiry.Per Gajendragadkar and Wanchoo, JJ.-The provisions of  para.486  were  merely  directory  and even	if  there  was	non-compliance   therewith	the  order  of	dismissal  was	 notinvalidated.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 270 of 1959.Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and	order  datedDecember  23,  1957, of the Allahabad  High  Court  (LucknowBench)	at  Lucknow in Civil Miscellaneous  Application	 (0.J.)

November, 25.  The Judgment of Sarkar, Subba Rao	 andMudholkar, JJ., was delivered by Subba Rao, J., and that  ofGajendragadkar	and Wanchoo, JJ., was delivered by  Wanchoo,J.SUBBA RAO, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against thejudgment  and  order  of the High  Court  of  Judicature  atAllahabad, Lucknow Bench, allowing the petition filed by therespondent under Art. 226 of the Constitution.The facts are in a small compass and may be briefly  stated.In the year 1933 the respondent was appointed a constable inU. P. Police Force; on December 1, 1945, he was promoted  tothe rank of head constable and in May, 1952 he was posted asofficer	 incharge  of Police  Station,	Intiathok,  DistrictGonda.	Complaints were received by the District Magistrate,Gonda,	to  the	 effect that the  respondent  was  receivingbribes	in  the discharge of his duties.  On  September	 16,1952,  the  District Magistrate, Gonda,	 directed  the	Sub-Divisional Magistrate to make an enquiry in respect of the674said  complaints.   On November 3,1952,	 the  Sub-DivisionalMagistrate, after making the necessary enquiries,  submitteda  report  to  the  District  Magistrate  recommending	 thetransfer  of  the respondent to some	other  station.	  OnNovember   17,	1952,  the  District  Magistrate   sent	  anendorsement  to the Superintendent of Police to	 the  effectthat  the  Sub-Divisional Magistrate had  found	 substantialcomplaints against the integrity of the respondent, that  hehad  also  received  such complaints and  that	his  generalreputation for integrity was not good, but that his transfershould,	 however,  come	 after	sometime  and  that  in	 themeantime his work might be closely watched.  On being calledupon   by  the	Superintendent	of  Police  to	 submit	  anexplanation  for his conduct, the respondent  submitted	 hisexplanation on November 29, 1952.  On December 17, 1952, therespondent was forced to go on leave for two months.  Beforethe expiry of his leave, he was reverted to his	 substantivepost  of  head	constable and transferred  to  Sitapur.	  OnFebruary   17,	1953,  he  was	promoted  to  the  rank	  ofofficiating  Sub-Inspector and posted as Station Officer  atSidholi.  On February 27, 1953, the Superintendent of Policemade the following endorsement in his character roll:"A strong officer with plenty of push in him and met with  astrong	opposition  in this new charge.	 Crime	control	 wasvery  good but complaints of corruption were received  whichcould not be substantiated.  Integrity certified."Meanwhile  on  further	complaints, the	 C.I.D.	 probed	 thematter	further and on July 26, 1953, the Superintendent  ofPolice,	 Investigation	Branch, C.I.D.,	 reported  that	 therespondent was a habitual bribetaker.  On July 28, 1953,  hewas  placed under suspension and on August 18, 1953, he	 wascharged under s. 7 of the Police Act with remissness in	 thedischarge of his duty and unfitness for the same inasmuch aswhile	posted	as  a  Station	Officer,   Police   Station,Intiathok, he had been guilty of dishonesty, corruption	 andmisbehaviour  in that he had on nine occasions,	 particularsof  which were given in the charge, accepted bribes. it	 maybe mentioned that the magisterial inquiry675related	 to  seven of the nine charges alleged	against	 therespondent.  The trial was conducted by the,  Superintendentof  Police and the respondent submitted his  explanation  onSeptember  12,	1953.	The Superintendent  of	Police,	 whoconducted the trial, examined many witnesses and found	thatseven  out  of	the  nine  charges  had	 been	established.Thereafter he issued a notice to the respondent calling uponhim  to show cause why he should not be dismissed  from	 thepolice	force.	 On February 20, 1954, the  respondent	sub-mitted his explanation and the Superintendent of Police,  byhis order dated February 22, 1954, dismissed the  respondentfrom  service  with effect from the said date.	 The  appealpreferred by the respondent to the Deputy Inspector  Generalof  Police  was dismissed by his order dated June  2,  1954.Thereafter  the	 respondent  on	 August	 5,  1954,  filed  apetition under Art. 226 of the Constitution before the	HighCourt  of  Judicature  at  Allahabad,  Lucknow	Bench,	 forquashing the order of dismissal.Before the High Court three points were raised, namely,	 (1)as  the	 petitioner  was officiating.  as  Sub-Inspector  ofPolice	 at   the  time	 of  the  departmental	 trial	 theSuprintendent  of Police had no power to dismiss him,  sincean  order  in  such circumstances could only be	 made  by  apolice	officer senior in rank to a Superintendent; (2)	 thetrial  was vitiated by a number of  serious  irregularities;and  (3)  the specific acts with which	the  petitioner	 wascharged	  were	cognizable  offences  and,  therefore,	 theSuperintendent of Police had no jurisdiction to proceed witha  departmental trial without complying with the  provisionsof subparagraph (1) of para. 486 of the Police	Regulations.The  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court  held  that	 therespondent  was charged with committing cognizable  offencesand  therefore sub-paragraph (1) of para. 486  governed	 thesituation and that, as no case, as required by the said sub-paragraph,  was	 registered against the	 respondent  in	 thepolice	station, the order of dismissal was  invalid.	Theyfurther	 held  that the case was not covered  by  the  firstproviso to sub-paragraph(1)  of para. 486, as, in their opinion, the information676about  the commission of the offences was not in  the  firstinstance  received by the Magistrate and forwarded   to	 thepolice	for inquiry.  In view of that finding they found  itunnecessary  for  them	to express any	opinion	 upon  otherarguments   which  had	been  advanced	on  behalf  of	 therespondent.  In the result they issued a writ in the  natureof  certiorari	quashing  the impugned	orders.	  Hence	 theappeal.Mr.  C.	 B.  Agarwala, learned	counsel	 appearing  for	 theappellants,  raised before us the following points: (1)	 TheGovernor  exercised his pleasure through the  Superintendentof  Police,  and,  as  the  Police  Regulations	 were	onlyadministrative	directions,  the  non-compliance   therewithwould  not  in any way affect the validity of the  order  ofdismissal.  (2) If the order of dismissal was held  to	havebeen  made  under  the statutory power	conferred  upon	 theSuperintendent	of  Police, the	 regulations  providing	 forinvestigation  in the first place under chapter XIV  of	 theCriminal  Procedure Code were only directory in nature,	 andinasmuch  as no prejudice was caused to the  respondent	 thenon-compliance	with the said regulations would	 not  affectthe   validity	 of  the  order	 of   dismissal.   (3)	 TheSuperintendent	of  Police  was	 authorized  to	 follow	 thealternative  procedure	prescribed by  subparagraph  (3)  ofpara. 486 and, therefore, the inquiry held without followingthe  procedure prescribed by rule I was not bad. (4) As	 themagisterial  inquiry was held in regard to  practically	 allthe  charges, the subject matter of the departmental  trial,the  case is not covered by the provisions of para.  486  ofthe Police Regulations.In the case of The State of U. P. v. Babu Ram Upadhya (1) inwhich	we  have  just	delivered  the	judgment,  we	haveconsidered  the	 first	three point;  and  for	the  reasonsmentioned therein we reject the first three contentions.The appellants must succeed on the fourth contention.	Fromthe  facts already narrated, the conduct of the	 respondent,when  he  was  officer	incharge  of  the  Police   Station,Intiathok, was the subject-matter of(1)  Civil Appeal No. 119 of 1950; [1961] 2 S.C.R. 679.677magisterial  inquiry.	The Sub-Divisional  Magistrate	madeinquiry	 in respect of seven of the charges which  were	 thesubject-matter	of the departmental trial and.	submitted  areport to the District Magistrate.  The District Magistrate,in  his	 turn,	made  an  endorsement  on  the	report	 andcommunicated  the  same	 to  the  Superintendent  of  Policerecommending  the transfer of the respondent and  suggestingthat  in the meanwhile the work of the respondent  might  beclosely	 watched.  Though the Superintendent of Police	gaveat first a good certificate to the respondent, in respect ofthe  same  a  further  probe was  made	through	 the  C.I.D.Thereafter   the  Superintendent  of  Police   conducted   adepartmental trial in respect of the aforesaid seven chargesand  two other new charges of the same nature.	The  inquiryended	in  the	 dismissal  of	the  respondent.    In	 thecircumstances it would be hypertechnical to hold that  therewas  no magisterial inquiry in respect of the  matter  whichwas  the subject-matter of the departmental trial.   On	 thesaid facts we hold that the departmental inquiry was only  afurther step in respect of the misconduct of the  respondentin  regard  whereto the magisterial inquiry was held  at  anearlier	 stage.	  If so, the question is whether  para.	 486would govern the present inquiry or it would fall out-side its scope.The relevant provisions of the Police Regulations read:Paragraph  486: "When the offence alleged against  a  policeofficer amounts to an offence only under s: 7 of the  PoliceAct, there can be no magisterial inquiry under the  CriminalProcedure Code.	 In such cases, and in other cases until andunless	a  magisterial inquiry is ordered, inquiry  will  bemade under the direction of the Superintendent of Police  inaccordance with the following rules;"Paragraph 489: "A police officer may be departmentally triedunder section 7 of the Police Act-(1)  after he has been tried judicially;(2)  after a magisterial inquiry under the CriminalProcedure Code;86678(3)   after  a	police	investigation  under  the   CriminalProcedure  Code or a departmental enquiry  under   paragraph486 III above."A combined reading of these provisions indicates that  para.86  does not apply to a case where a magisterial inquiry  isordered;  and  that a police officer can  be  departmentallytried under s. 7 of the Police Act after such a	 magisterialinquiry.   In  this  case the departmental  trial  was	heldsubsequent to the completion of the magisterial inquiry	 andtherefore it falls within the express terms of para. 489(2).The fact that in the interregnum the police received furthercomplaints or that the C.I.D. made further enquiries do	 notaffect the question, if substantially the subject-matter  ofthe  magisterial inquiry and the departmental trial  is	 thesame.	In this case we have held that it was  substantiallythe  same and therefore the departmental trial	was  validlyheld.	We, therefore, set aside the order made by the	HighCourt.	 As we have pointed out earlier, the High Court,  inthe  view  taken by it, did not express its opinion  on	 theother  questions  raised  and  argued  before  it.   In	 thecircumstances,	we remand the matter to the High  Court	 fordisposal in accordance with law.The costs of this appeal will abide the result.WANCHOO, J.-We have read the judgment just delivered by	 ourlearned	 brother  Subba	 Rao  J. We  agree  with  the  orderproposed by him.  Our reasons for coming to this  conclusionare,  however, the same which we have given in C.A.  119  of1959, The State of Uttar Pradesh v. Babu Ram Upadhya.	      Appeal allowed.  Case remanded.679
