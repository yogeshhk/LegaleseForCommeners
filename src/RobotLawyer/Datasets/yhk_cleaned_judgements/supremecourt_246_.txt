While	the  application  was  pending	 theCompanies  Act,	 1913, was repealed by	the  Companies	Act,1956.	The  appellant	company	 thereupon  applied  to	 theDistrict judge to dismiss the application on the ground thathe  had	 ceased to have any jurisdiction to  deal  with	 theapplication on the repeal of the Companies Act Of 1913.Held,  that  s. 6 of the General Clauses Act  preserved	 thejurisdiction  of  the  District	 judge	to  deal  with	 theapplication  under S. 153-C Of the Indian Companies  Act  Of1913, notwithstanding the repeal of that Act.Section 647 of the Companies Act, 1956 did not indicate	 anyintention  to affect the rights under the  Indian  CompaniesAct of 19I3, for s. 658 of the Companies Act of 1956 made s.6  of  the General Clauses  Act	 applicable  notwithstandinganything contained in s. 647 of that Act.86Section 24 of the General Clauses Act does not put an end toany   notification.   It  does	not  therefore	cancel	 thenotification  issued under the Indian Companies Act of	I9I3in so far as that notification empowered the District  judgeto  exercise  jurisdiction  under s.  153-C  of	 the  IndianCompanies  Act	of  I9I3  even though under  s.	 10  of	 theCompanies  Act	of 1956, a District judge can no  longer  beempowered  to exercise jurisdiction under (a) sections	1397to  407 of the Companies Act, 1956, which correspond  to  S.I53-C Of the Indian Companies Act, 19I3 or (b) in respect ofthe winding up of a company with a paid up share capital  ofnot  less  than Rs. 1,00,000/- which the  appellant  companywas.JUDGMENT:       CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 513 of 1958.       Appeal  by special leave from the judgment and  order  dated       November 20, 1957, of the Bombay High Court in First  Appeal       No. 600 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated       October	17,  1956, of the District Judge, Poona,  in  Misc.       Petition No. 2 of 1956.       H.   D.	Banaji, S. N. Andley, J. B.  Dadachanji,  Rameshwar       Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the appellant.       A.   V.	Viswanatha Sastri, Sorab N. Vakil, B. K.  B.  Naidu       and I. N. Shroff, for respondents Nos.  1 and 2.       1960.   February,  22.	The  Judgment  of  the	Court	was       delivered by       SARKAR, J.-Respondents Nos.  I to 4 are shareholders in	the       company	which is the appellant in this case.  They made	 an       application against the appellant and its directors under s.       153-C  of  the  Companies  Act, 1913  before  that  Act	was       repealed	 on  April 1, 1956, as hereinafter  mentioned,	for       certain	reliefs which it is not necessary to  state.   This       Act  will  be  referred	to  as	the  Act  of  1913.    This       application had been made to the Court of the District Judge       of  Poona  which	 Court	had  been  empowered  to   exercise       jurisdiction under the Act of 1913 by a notification  issued       by  the	Government  of Bombay under s. 3(1)  of	 that  Act.       Before the application could be disposed of by the  District       Judge, Poona, the Act of 1913 was repealed and re-enacted on       April  1, 1956, by the Companies Act of 1956, which will	 be       referred to as the Act of 1956.       On or about June 28, 1956, the appellant made an application       to  the District Judge of Poona for an order dismissing	the       application under s. 153-C of the       87       Act of 1913 on the ground that on the repeal of that Act the       Court had ceased to have jurisdiction to deal with it.	The       District	 Judge	of Poona dismissed this	 application.	The       appellants  appeal to the High Court of Bombay against  this       dismissal also failed.  Hence the present appeal.       Section	644 of the Act of 1956 repeals the Act of 1913	and       certain	other legislation relating to companies.   Sections       645  to	657  of	 the Act of  1956  contain  various  saving       provisions.    Mr.  Banaji  appearing  for   the	  appellant       contended  that the proceeding before the District Judge	 of       Poona  under s. 153-C of the Act of 1913 had not been  saved       by any of these provisions.  We do not consider it necessary       to pronounce on this question for it seems to us clear  that       that  proceeding can be continued in spite of the repeal	 of       the Act of 1913 in view of s. 6 of the General Clauses  Act.       Section 658 of the Act of 1956 expressly provides that, "The       mention	of particular matters in ss. 645 to 657 or  in	any       other provision of this Act shall not prejudice the  general       application  of s.6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897  (X	 of       1.897),	with respect to the effect of repeals." Mr.  Banaji       said that s. 658 had been enacted ex abundante cautela.	 Be       it  so.	Section 6 of the General Clauses Act none the  less       remains applicable with respect to the effect of the  repeal       of the Act of 1913.       Section 6 of the General Clauses Act provides that where	 an       Act is repealed, then, unless a different intention appears,       the repeal shall not affect any right or liability  acquired       or  incurred  under  the repealed  enactment  or	 any  legal       proceeding  in  respect of such right or liability  and	the       legal  proceeding may be continued as, if the repealing	Act       had  not been passed.  There is no dispute that s. 153-C	 of       the Act of 1913 gave certain rights to the shareholders of a       company and put the company as also its directors and manag-       ing agents under certain liabilities.  The application under       that  section  was  for	enforcement  of	 these	rights	and       liabilities.   Section  6 of the General Clauses	 Act  would       therefore preserve the rights and liabilities created by	 s.       153-C of the Act of 1913 and a continuance of the proceeding       in respect thereof would be       88       competent in spite of the repeal of the Act of 1913,  unless       of course a different intention would be gathered.       Now  it	has been held by this Court in State of	 Punjab	 v.       Mohar  Singh (1) that s. 6 applies even where the  repealing       Act  contains fresh legislation on the same subject  but	 in       such a case one would have to look to the provisions of	the       new  Act	 for  the  purposes  of	 determining  whether  they       indicate	 a different intention.	 The Act of 1956  not  only       repeals the Act of 1913 but contains other fresh legislation       on  the matters enacted by the Act of 1913.  It was  further       observed	 in  State  of Punjab v. Mohar Singh  (1)  that	 in       trying to ascertain whether there is a contrary intention in       the  new	 legislation, " the line of enquiry  would  be	not       whether	the  new Act expressly keeps &live old	rights	and       liabilities but whether it manifests an intention to destroy       them."       The question then is whether the Act of 1956 indicates  that       it was intended thereby to destroy the rights created by	 s.       153-C  of the Act of 1913.  Mr. Banaji said that s.  647	 of       the Act of 1956 indicates an intention to destroy the rights       created	by  s. 153-C of the Act of 1913.  We  find  nothing       there  to  support this view.  That section only	 says  that       where  the  winding  up of a company  commences	before	the       commencement of the Act of 1956, the company shall be  wound       up as if that Act had not been passed, but s. 555(7) of	the       Act  of 1956 will apply in respect of moneys paid  into	the       Companies  Liquidation Account.	All that this section  does       is to make the provisions of the repealed Act applicable	 to       the  winding up notwithstanding the repeal.  The	 provisions       of  s. 555(7) need not be referred to as they do not  affect       the  question.	Section 647 of the Act	of  1956  therefore       indicates  no intention that the rights created by s.  153-C       of  the Act of 1913 shall be destroyed.	Nor is an  argument       tenable that since by s. 647 the Act of 1956 expressly makes       the repealed Act applicable to a winding up commenced  under       it,  it	impliedly  indicates  that  in	other  matters	the       repealed	 Act cannot be resorted to, for, in view of s.	658       of the Act of 1956,       (1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 893       89       the  mention  of	 a particular matter in s.  647	 would	not       prejudice  the  application of s. 6 of the  General  Clauses       Act;  in other words, nothing in s. 647 is to be	 understood       as indicating an intention that s. 6 of the General  Clauses       Act  is	not to apply.  On the other hand, the  parties	are       agreed  that the provisions of s. 153-C of the Act  of  1913       have  been substantially re-enacted by the Act of  1956	and       this  would indicate an intention not to destroy the  rights       created by s. 153-C.       Mr.  Banaji then drew our attention to s. 10 of the  Act	 of       1956  and s. 24 of the General Clauses Act.  Section  10	 of       the  Act of 1956 corresponds to s. 3 of the Act of 1913	and       deals  with  the jurisdiction of Courts.	 Under	s.  10	the       Central Government may empower a District Court to  exercise       jurisdiction  under  the	 Act, not  being  the  jurisdiction       conferred  among others by ss. 397 to 407 nor in respect	 of       the winding up of companies with a paid up share capital	 of       not less than Rs. 1,00,000.  Sections 397 to 407 of the	Act       of  1956, it is agreed, contain' substantially  the  provis-       sions  of  s. 153-C of the Act of 1913.	It has also  to	 be       stated  that  the paid up capital of the appellant  is  more       than Rs. 1,00,000 and the application under s. 153-C of	the       Act  of 1913 contained a prayer in the alternative  for	the       winding	up  of the appellant.  Section 24  of  the  General       Clauses Act provides that where any Act is repealed and	re-       enacted	with or without modifications, then, unless  it	 is       otherwise expressly provided, any notification issued  under       the  repealed  Act shall, so far as it is  not  inconsistent       with  the  provisions re-enacted, continue in force  and	 be       deemed  to  have	 been issued under the	provisions  so	re-       enacted unless and until it is superseded by a  notification       issued under those provisions..       Mr.  Banaji points out that in view of s. 10 of the  Act	 of       1956  a	District Court can no longer be empowered  to  deal       with  an application of the kind made to the District  Judge       of  Poona, as that application asks for reliefs	similar	 to       those contemplated by ss. 397 to 407 of the Act of 1956	and       also  asks  for the winding up of a company  whose  paid	 up       capital exceeds Rs. 1,00,000 and power to deal with such an       90       application  cannot now be given to a District  Court.	He,       therefore,  says that the notification issued under the	Act       of 1913 empowering the District Judge of Poona to deal  with       the  application would be inconsistent in this respect  with       the  provisions of the Act of 1956 and could not in view	 of       s.  24 of the General Clauses Act be deemed to  continue	 in       force  after  the repeal of the Act of 1913.   Hence  it	 is       contended that the notification has ceased to have any force       and the District Judge of Poona has no longer any  jurisdic-       tion  to	 hear the application.	It is also said	 that  this       shows  that  the	 Act  of 1956  indicates  that	the  rights       acquired	 under the Act of 1913 would come to an end on	its       repeal.       We  are unable to accept these contentions.  Section  10	 of       the Act of 1956 deals only with the jurisdiction of  courts.       It shows that the District Courts can no longer be empowered       to  deal with applications under the Act of 1956 in  respect       of  matters  contemplated by s. 153-C of the  Act  of  1913.       This  does not indicate that the rights created by s.  153-C       of  the	Act of 1913 were intended to be destroyed.   As	 we       have earlier pointed out from State of Punjab v. Mohar Singh       (1),  the contrary intention in the repealing Act must  show       that  the  rights  under the old Act  were  intended  to	 be       destroyed in order to prevent the application of	 s.  6	 of       the General Clauses Act.	 But it is said that s.	 24 of	the       General	Clauses Act puts an end to the notification  giving       power  to the District Judge, Poona to hear the	application       under  s. 153-C of the Act of 1913 as that  notification	 is       inconsistent with s. 10 of the Act of 1956 and the  District       Judge cannot, therefore, continue to deal with the  applica-       tion.  Section 24 does not however purport to put an end	 to       any  notification.   It	is not intended	 to  terminate	any       notification;  all it does is to continue a notification	 in       force in the stated circumstances after the Act under  which       it  was issued, is repealed.  Section 24 therefore does	not       cancel  the  notification empowering the District  Judge	 of       Poona  to exercise jurisdiction under the Act of	 l9l3.	 It       seems to us that since under s. 6 of the General Clauses Act       the proceeding in respect of the application under s. 153-C       (1)  [1955] I S.C.R. 893       91       of the Act of 1913 may be continued after the repeal of that       Act,  it follows that the District Judge of Poona  continues       to  have	 jurisdiction to entertain it. If it were  not	so,       then s. 6 would become infructuous.       For these reasons we think that the appeal must fail and	 it       is therefore dismissed with costs.       Appeal dismissed.
