The Labour Union demanded bonus for	 theyear  1958  on the basis of the pact,  but  the	 mill-ownersclaimed that the pact was contrary to the formula evolved bythe  Full Bench in Mill Owners' Association, Bombay  v.	 TheRashtriya  Mill Mazdoor Sangh, Bombay, [1950] 2 L.L.J.	247,which  was approved by the Supreme Court in  The  AssociatedCement	Companies  Ltd. v. Its Workmen, [1959]	S.C.R.	925,inasmuch  as  (1) rehabilitation provided in  the  Agreementdiffered  vitally from rehabilitation as explained  in	thatdecision,  (2)	the  Agreement provided	 for  payment  of  aminimum bonus even though there may be no available  surplusand  even though the particular mill might have made  actualloss,  and (3) while the Full Bench Formula, as approved  bythe  Supreme  Court  treated a particular year	as  a  self-sufficient unit, there was provision for set-off and  set-onin  the	 Agreement.  The Industrial Tribunal  to  which	 thedispute	 was referred in the. form of sixty-six	 references,one  relating to each mill, took the view that the pact	 didnot  in	 any  way run counter to the law laid  down  by	 theSupreme	 Court, and that the extension of the agreement	 forone more year would help in promoting peace in the  industryin Ahmedabad.Held  (Subba  Rao,  J.-dissenting)  that  the  Agreement  inquestion departed from the Full Bench Formula in the  matterof  bonus,  in certain vital aspects and that  the  Tribunalwhen  it  extended  the	 Agreement for	the  year  1958	 wasignoring  the law as laid down by the Supreme Court  as,  towhat profit, bonus,was and how it should be worked out.2The Tribunal had no power by extending the Agreement to makeit possible for payment of a minimum bonus for the year 1958even when there was either insufficient available surplus topay  bonus  or no available surplus at all  or	even  actualloss.The jurisdiction of the Tribunal was limited by its terms ofreference,  which was not on industry-cum-region basis,	 butone for each mill to consider the question of bonus for eachmill  for  the	year  1958  and,  consequently,	 it  had  nojurisdiction to apply the principle of set-off and set-on tobe found in the Agreement in respect of payment of bonus  ortake into account the profits of the industry as a whole  inAhmedabad.Per Gajendragadkar, Sarkar, Wanchoo and Mudholkar, JJ.It  isopen to an industrial court in an appropriate case to imposenew obligations on the parties before it or modify contractsin the interest of industrial peace or give awards which mayhave  the effect of extending Agreement or making  new	one,but  this  power is conditioned by the subject	matter	withwhich it is dealing and also by the existing industrial	 lawand  it	 would,not  be	open to	 it  while  dealing  with  aparticular  matter before it to overlook the industrial	 lawrelating  to that matter as laid down by the legislature  orby the Supreme Court.Western India Automobile Association v.

The Judgment of Gajendragadkar,  Sarkar,Wanchoo	 and  Mudholkar, JJ. was delivered  by	Wanchoo,  J.Subba Rao, J. delivered a separate Judgment.WANCHOO, J.-These eighteen appeals by' special leave raise acommon	question  and will be dealt with by  this  judgment.The appellants are certain cotton textile mills in Ahmedabadwhile  the respondent in each appeal is the  Textile  LabourAssociation,  Ahmedabad, which is a representative union  ofthe  cotton textile workers in Ahmedabad.  The total  numberof  cotton textile mills in Ahmedabad is 66;  therefore,  66references under s. 73-A of the Bombay Industrial  RelationsAct, No. XI of 1947 (hereinafter called the Act), were	madeto the industrial court for arbitration of disputes  arisingout of notices of change			     4given  by  the	respondent making a  demand  for  bonus	 foremployees  of textile mills in Ahmedabad.  It  appears	thatthere	was   an  agreement  between  the   Textile   LabourAssociation  and  the  Ahmedabad  Mill-owners'	 Associationrepresenting the member-mills on June 27, 1955	(hereinafterreferred  to as the Agreement), with respect to	 payment  ofbonus by the mills to their employees.	The Agreement was toremain	in force for a period of five years, beginning	withJanuary	 1,  1953, and ending with December  31,  1957,	 andrelated	 to bonus for the five calendar years from  1953  to1957  (both inclusive).	 When the Agreement came to  an	 enddisputes arose about bonus for the year 1958.  The Agreementwas  not extended and a notice of change under s. 42 of	 theAct  was  given	 by the Textile Labour	Association  to	 theAhmedabad   Mill-owners'  Association  on  July	 21,   1959,claiming  that	all the employees employed during  the	year1958 in the member-mills be paid an adequate amount of bonushaving	regard	to the volume of profits, if  any,  or	somebonus  irrespective of profits to fill the gap	between	 theexisting  wage	and the living wage so as  to  avoid  unrestamong the employees.  It further appears that notice in	 thesame  terms  was given to individual mills  about  the	sametime.	As no agreement was arrived at between the  parties,66 references with respect to the sixty-six mills were	madeto  the	 industrial court as already mentioned	above.	 Theindustrial  court  considered all the  sixty-six  referencestogether  and came to the conclusion that the  Agreement  of1955  had worked fairly to both sides and was  substantiallyin accord with the long-standing practice in the industry inAhmedabad  even before the Agreement and that its  extensionfor one year was essential for keeping industrial peace.  Ittherefore  ordered  the extension of the Agreement  for	 theyear 1958 and directed the parties to file within six  weeksfrom the date of the award calculations of bonus payable forthe  year 1958 in the light of the decision  and  thereafterthe  court would proceed to award appropriate bonus  in	 thecase  of each individual mill.	Thereupon there were  fifty-two applications for special leave to5appeal	to  this Court in which special leave  was  granted.Thirty-four of the appeals arising out of the special  leavepetitions  have been withdrawn and only eighteen now  remainfor decision.  It appears that the remaining fourteen  millsaccepted  the decision of the industrial court, so that	 nowforty-eight  mills are out of the picture and only  eighteenare before the Court.The main contention of the appellants before the  industrialcourt  was that in view of the law laid down as to bonus  bythis  Court in the Associated Cement Companies Ltd.  v.	 TheWorkmen	 (1), it was not open to it to extend the  Agreementfor  the year 1958 as that would be against the	 concept  ofbonus  as understood in industrial law.	 The same  point  isbeing  urged  before  us and the  question  that  falls	 fordecision is whether the industrial court was right in law inextending the Agreement for another year.In order to appreciate the dispute between the parties	withrespect	 to the extension of the Agreement we may  refer  tothe salient terms of the Agreement.  Before we do so, we maymention	 that  the  Agreement was  "without  renouncing	 thegeneral principles enunciated in decisions and awards of thearbitration   boards,  the  industrial	court,	the   LabourAppellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court in respect of bonusor  the rights and privileges created thereunder".  It	wasentered	 into  only with a view to creating  goodwill  amongworkers	 and  for the purpose of maintaining  peace  in	 theindustry  and without creating a precedent for	the  future.The Agreement in the first place provided that the claim  ofthe  employees	for bonus would only arise if  there  is  anavailable  surplus of profit after making provision for	 allthe prior charges.  These prior charges were: (i)  statutorydepreciation  and the development rebate; (ii) taxes;  (iii)reserve for rehabilitation, replacement and modernisation ofblock  as  calculated by the industrial	 court	(basic	year1947);	(iv)  six  per	centum	return	on  paid-up  capitalincluding  bonus  shares; and (v) two per  cent.  return  onreserves  employed as working capital.	After the  availablesurplus was determined thus, a mill(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.6having	an  available surplus of profit had to	pay  to	 itsemployees  bonus  which	 would in no case be  less  than  anamount	equivalent to 4.8% of basic wages earned during	 theyear;  nor was it to exceed an amount equivalent to  25%  ofthe  basic  wages  earned  during the  year.   It  was	alsoprovided  that in case the available surplus was  more	thansufficient  for granting bonus at a higher figure  than	 theceiling	 of  twenty five per centum of	basic  wages  earnedduring	the year and the maximum bonus of 25 per centum	 waspaid,  such a mill would be deemed to have set aside a	partof  the residue of available surplus after grant of  maximumbonus  not exceeding 25 per cent. of the basic wages  earnedduring the year as a reserve for bonus for purposes of	"seton"  (adjustment)  in  subsequent years.   Secondly  it	 wasprovided  that	where in the case of a mill,  the  availablesurplus	 was  not more than the ceiling of 25 per  cent.  ofbasic wages fixed for bonus, the bonus would be fixed  afterdeducting  at least Rs. 10,000 from the	 available  surplus.Further	 it  was provided that if a mill  had  an  availablesurplus	 of  profits which would suffice to pay bonus  at  arate  lower than the minimum of 4.8 per cent. it  would	 paythe  minimum  and would be entitled to set  off	 the  excessamount	thus  paid  against  the  available  surplus  in   asubsequent year or years and there were provisions how	thisset-off would be worked out.  Lastly it was provided that ifthe profits of a mill were not sufficient to provide for allprior  charges	as  mentioned  above,  though  it  had	madeprofits,  or  where the mill had actually suffered  a  loss,such  a mill would a& a special case for  creating  goodwillamong  its workers and for continuing peace in the  industrybut  without creating a precedent pay to its  employees	 theminimum bonus equivalent to 4.8 per cent. of the basic wagesbut  would  be entitled to set off this amount	towards	 anyavailable surplus in any subsequent years, subject, however,always	to a payment of a minimum bonus at the rate  of	 4.8per cent. of basic wages earned during the year.It  has been contended on behalf of the appellants that	 theformula under the Agreement departs in7some  vital  aspects from what is known as  the	 Full  Benchformula	 evolved  by the Labour Appellate  Tribunal  in	 TheMill-owners'  Association,  Bombay  v.	The  Bashtriya	MillMazdoor Sangh (1), which has been approved by this Court  inthe  Associated Cement Companies' case (2) and is  thus	 thelaw  of the land so far as bonus is concerned.	It is  urgedtherefore  that inasmuch as the formula under the  Agreementdeparts from the Full-Bench formula which is now the law  ofthe land, it was not open to the industrial court to  extendthe  Agreement in the face of the decision of this Court  inAssociated  Cement  Companies' case(1) and in so far  as  theindustrial  court  has done so it has gone against  the	 lawrelating  to  bonus and therefore the award  should  be	 setaside.Two  questions	immediately arise in  this  connection:	 thefirst relates to the jurisdiction of the industrial court toimpose	new obligations upon the parties and the  second  iswhether	 if the industrial court has jurisdiction to  imposenew  obligations  it could do so in a matter  of  this	kindconsidering  the  concept  of  bonus as	 laid  down  by	 thedecisions of this Court.So  far	 as  the first question is  concerned  (namely,	 thegeneral	  power	 of  an	 industrial  court  to	impose	 newobligations  upon  the	parties), the matter  is  now  well-settled	 by the decisions of the Federal Court and  also  ofthis  Court.   It was held by the Federal Court	 in  WesternIndia Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal,  Bombayand Others (3) that-	      "	  adjudication does not in our opinion	mean	      adjudication  according to the strict  law  of	      master and servant.  The award of the tribunal	      may  contain  provisions for settlement  of  a	      dispute  which no court could order if it	 was	      bound by ordinary law, but the tribunal is not	      fettered in any way by these limitations."	      The  Federal Court also approved the  view  of	      Ludwig Teller that-	      "industrial   arbitration	 may   involve	 the	      extension	 of an agreement or the making of  a	      new one, or in	      (1)  [1950]  2  L.L.J.  1247.	 (2)  [1959]	      S.C.R. 925.			  (3) [1949] F.C.R. 321.	      8	      general  the  creation of new  obligations  or	      modification  of	old  ones  while  commercial	      arbitration  generally  concerns	itself	with	      interpretation  of  existing  obligations	 and	      disputes relating to existing agreements	(see	      p. 345)."	      This  Court also in Rohtas Industries Ltd.  v.	      Brijnandan Pandey (1) held that-	      "	 a court of law proceeds on the footing that	      no   power  exists  in  the  courts  to	make			    contracts for the people; and the parties must	      make  their own contracts.  The  Courts  reach	      their   limit  of	 power	when  they   enforce	      contracts	 which	the parties have  made.	  An	      industrial tribunal is not so fettered and may	      create new obligations or modify contracts  in	      the interests of industrial peace, to  protect	      legitimate  trade	 union	activities  and	  to	      prevent  unfair practice and/or  victimisation	      (see p. 810)."	      In Patna Electric Supply Co. v. Patna Electric	      Supply  Workers'	Union (2), this	 Court	held	      that-	      "there  is no doubt that in appropriate  cases	      industrial   adjudication	  may	impose	 new	      obligations on the employer in the interest of	      social justice and with the object of securing	      peace and harmony between the employer and his	      workmen and full cooperation between them (see	      p. 1038)."and approved of the decision of the Federal Court in WesternIndia Automobile Association's case (3).  There is no  doubttherefore  that	 it  is open to an industrial  court  in  anappropriate  case to impose new obligations on	the  partiesbefore it or modify contracts in the interest of  industrialpeace or give awards which may have the effect of  extendingexisting agreement or making a new one.	 This, however, doesnot mean than an industrial court can do anything and every-thing  when dealing with an industrial dispute.	 This  poweris  conditioned	 by  the subject-matter	 with  which  it  isdealing and also by the existing industrial law and it wouldnot  be	 open to it while dealing with a  particular  matterbefore it to overlook the industrial(1) [1956] S.C.R. 800.	  (2) [1959] SUPP. 2 S.C.R. 761.(3)  [1949] F.C.R. 32.9law relating to that matter as laid down by the	 legislatureor by this Court.This  brings  us to the second question, which is  the	realquestion in dispute in this case, namely, when dealing	witha  bonus  case,	 like  the  present,  was  it  open  to	 theindustrial  court  to overlook the law laid 7 down  by	thisCourt  in Associated Cement Companies' case (1) and make  anaward  extending the Agreement for a further period  of	 oneyear?In order to determine this question, we have to look at	 theconcept	 of bonus as evolved in the industrial law  of	thiscountry	 by industrial tribunals and now by the decision  ofthis  Court.  So far as we can see, there are four types  ofbonus  which have been evolved under the industrial  law  aslaid down by this Court.  Firstly, there is what is called aproduction bonus or incentive wage (see Titaghur Paper MillsV. Its Workmen (2) ); the second is bonus as an implied termof  contract between the parties (see Messrs. Ispahani	Ltd.v.  Ispahani Employees' Union (3)); the third  is  customarybonus  in  connection  with some festival  (see	 The  GrahamTrading	 Co.  v. Its Workmen (4)) and the fourth  is  profitbonus which was evolved by the Labour Appellate Tribunal  inThe  Mill-owners' Association Bombay v. The  Rashtriya	MillMazdoor Sangh, Bombay (5), and which has been considered  bythis  Court fully in two cases.	 We are in the present	casedealing with bonus of the fourth kind, namely, profit  bonusand  what  we say subsequently refers only to this  kind  ofbonus.What  is  the  concept of profit bonus	with  which  we	 areconcerned  in this case, for it is this concept	 which	willdetermine  whether  it was open to the industrial  court  inthis  case to extend the Agreement for 1958?  In Muir  MillsCo. Ltd. v. Suti Mills Mazdoor Union (6), this Court pointedout that-	      "There  are two conditions, which have  to  be	      satisfied	 before	 a demand for bonus  can  be	      justified and (1)  [1959]  S.C.R. 925.(2)  [1959]  SUPP.  2	      S.C.R. 1012.	       (3)  [1960] 1 S.C.R. 24.(4) [1960]  1  S.C.R.	      107.	       (5) [1950] 2 L.L.J. 1247.(6) [1955] 1  S.C.R.	      991.	      2	      10 they  are: (1) when wages fall short  of  the	      living  standard, and (2) industry makes	huge	      profits	part  of  which	 are  due   to	 the	      contribution   which  the	 workmen   make	  in	      increasing  production.  The demand for  bonus	      becomes	an   industrial	   claim............	      The   basis  for the claim is that labour	 and	      capital both contribute to the earning of	 the	      industrial concern and it is fair that  labour	      should'  derive  some benefit, if there  is  a	      surplus  after  meeting  prior  or   necessary	      charges...............   The   surplus	that	      remained	after  meeting the  aforesaid  prior	      charges would be available for distribution as	      bonus."The  matter  was  again	 considered by	this  Court  in	 theAssociated  Cement Companies' case (1) where the Full  Benchformula	 evolved by the Labour Appellate Tribunal  was	goneinto at length.	 The workmen contended in that case that theformula	 required  revision as the employers  were  becomingincreasingly   more   rehabilitation-conscious	 and   theirappetite  for  the  provision for  rehabilitation  was	fastgrowing	 with the result that in most cases, after  allowingfor  rehabilitation,  there  was no  surplus  left  for	 thepurpose of bonus and the main object of the formula was thusfrustrated.   It was further contended for the workmen	thatthe whole of rehabilitation expenses should not be  providedfor   out  of  trading	profits	 and  that  the	 claim	 forrehabilitation	should be fixed at a reasonable	 amount	 andthe  industry  should be required to find the  balance	fromother  sources.	 It was there held that"though there may  besome  force  in the plea made for the revision of  the	FullBench  formula,	 the problem raised by the said plea  is  ofsuch  a	 character that it can appropriately  be  consideredonly  by  a high-powered commission and not by	this  Court,while hearing the present group of appeals."This Court	alsoheld that-	      "the Full Bench formula had on the whole work-	      ed fairly satisfactorily in a large number  of	      industries all over the country, and the claim	      for  bonus should be decided by the  Tribunals	      on   the	 basis	of  this   formula   without	      attempting to revise it.	The	      (1)   [1959] S.C.R. 925.	      11	      formula was elastic enough to meet  reasonably	      the  claims  of the industry  and	 labour	 for	      fair-play and justice............ It was based	      on two considerations: first, that labour	 was	      entitled	to  claim  a share  in	the  trading	      profits of the industry, because it had parti-	      ally contributed to the same; and second, that	      labour  was  entitled to claim  that  the	 gap	      between  its actual wage and the	living	wage	      should within reasonable limits be filled up."The  Full  Bench  formula  provided  for  arriving  at	 theavailable  surplus after meeting prior charges, namely,	 (i)depreciation,  (ii) taxes, (iii) return on paid-up  capital,(iv) return on working capital and (v) rehabilitation.	 Theformula further dealt with the claim for bonus on the  basisthat  the  relevant  year  is  a  selfsufficient  unit	 andappropriate accounts have to be made in respect of the	saidyear.	Finally, it was pointed out that it was	 only  afterall the prior charges had thus been determined and  deductedfrom  the gross profits that the available surplus could  beascertained  for  payment  of  bonus,  and  that  when	 theavailable  surplus  had been ascertained, there	 were  threeparties	 entitled  to  claim  shares  therein,	namely,	 (i)labour's  claim	 for bonus, (ii) industry's  claim  for	 thepurpose	 of  expansion	and  other  needs,  and	 (iii)	 theshareholders'  claim  for additional return on	the  capitalinvested  by  them; the ratio of distribution  would  neces-sarily	depend on several factors.  It would thus  be  clearthat  the  essential concept of profit bonus is	 that  thereshould	be an available surplus determined according to	 theprinciples  laid  down	in the	cases  mentioned  above	 fordistribution.	If  there is no such available	surplus	 fordistribution,  there  can be no case for payment  of  profitbonus.	 This  is the industrial law as laid  down  by	thisCourt  with  respect  to this kind of  bonus  in  AssociatedCement Companies' case (1).  It would in our opinion be	 notopen  to an industrial court or tribunal to ignore this	 lawas to bonus and to extend an agreement for payment of bonus,which is against the basic concept of bonus as laid down  bythe decisions of this Court on the ground that an(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.12industrial court has power generally to extend agreements orto  create  new obligations.  As already pointed  out,	thatpower has to be exercised keeping in view the subject-matterbefore the tribunal and the law laid down by the legislatureor  by	the decisions of this Court, with  respect  to	thatsubject-matter.	  The industrial court in this case was	 notunaware	 of this position, viz., that it *as departing	fromthe  law laid down in the Associated Cement Companies'	case(1)  and other bonus cases; but it held that this Court	 wasdealing in those cases with individual units, and not with acase  where there were numerous concerns in an	industry  atone  centre,  with its	particular  historical	back-ground,where  previous awards had been on an  industry-wise  basis.It therefore held that the decisions of this Court could notapply  in their entirety to the dispute before it  and	thatthis  Court  could not have intended that in  a	 case  wherethere  was the additional circumstance that the parties	 hadthemselves  voluntarily modified the bonus formula  in	somerespects  by  a	 long  term agreement,	that  could  not  beextended  by an industrial court.  It is the correctness  ofthis view which has been strongly disputed before us by	 theappellants.Before	deal with this matter, we should like to  point	 outthat  the  fact	 that  there  are  numerous  concerns  in  aparticular  place can have no relevance in  considering	 thequestion  whether the Full Bench formula can apply to  caseslike  the present.  Even though this Court was dealing	withthe  case  of  one concern, namely,  the  Associated  CementCompanies,  it pointed out that the Full Bench	formula	 hadworked fairly satisfactorily all over the country and shouldcontinue to be applied without revision till such time as  ahigh-powered commission went into the question.	 There is inour  opinion no question of industry-cum-region approach  inthe  matter  of a bonus dispute of this kind.  There  is  nodoubt  that  in	 many matters,	like  wages,  conditions  ofservice, over-time allowance, dearness allowance,  gratuity,and  so on, industry- cum-region approach has been  made  byindustrial courts(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.13in  this  country  and, rightly so.  But there	is,  in	 ouropinion,  no scope for an approach of this kind in the	caseof bonus, the basic concept of which is that payment dependson surplus of profits available according to some formula inthe  case  of each industrial concern.	Nor can it  be	saidthat  the  Agreement in this case is dealing with  bonus  inwhat  is  known as industry-cumregion  basis.	Its  salientterms  as set out above will show that it deals	 with  bonusaccording  to available surplus of each mill, so that  bonuspaid  by each mill depends on its own available surplus	 andthe  sixty-six mills situate in Ahmedabad may pay  differentamounts of bonus varying from a minimum of 4-8 per cent.  ofthe basic wages to 25 per cent. of the basic wages.  Similardifferences will arise if the Full Bench formula is  appliedto  the	 sixty-six mills in Ahmedabad.	Thus  the  Agreementwhich has been extended, is not based on industry-cum-regionapproach,  as  it is understood.  That approach,  say,	withrespect to wages means that wages of all concerns situate ina particular area engaged in a particular industry should bethe same.  On that approach the bonus of all these sixty-sixmills  should also be the same percentage for each  mill  inthat area; but that is not the basis on which the  Agreementwas  arrived  at. The basis of the Agreement  is  that	eachindividual  mill  is  treated as a  separate  unit  and	 itsavailable surplus worked out according to the formula in theAgreement itself.  This is also the basis of the Full  Benchformula and the available surplus of each unit is worked outaccording  to  that  formula,  though  the  result  of	 theapplication of the two formulae in each case may not be	 thesame.	There is in our opinion therefore  no  justificationfor  the view that the Full Bench formula approved  by	thisCourt in the Associated Cement Companies' case (1) can	haveno  application	 where there are numerous  concerns  of	 onenature at one centre.  Some bonus awards were brought to ournotice to show that they were on industry-cum-region  basis,namely,	 The Sugar Mills of Bihar v. Their Workmen  (2)	 andThe Sugar Mills, Uttar Pradesh v.(1) [1959] S.C.R. 925.(2) [1951] I. L. L. J. 469.14Their Workmen(1).  These awards related to sugar industry inUttar Pradesh and in Bihar.  As we read these decisions,  wedo  not	 find real industry-cumregion approach	which  wouldresult	in  uniform bonus for all the mills  dealt  with  bythese two awards.  What we find is that a different  formulawas  worked  out  for  awarding	 profit	 bonus	linked	withproduction  on the basis that there were profits;  but	whenthe  formula is worked for each mill the bonus would  differfrom mill to mill according to its production.	Further,  wefind  that  in	the Uttar Pradesh case	there  were  certainexemptions  granted to certain factories, presumably on	 theground	that  they were not in a position to pay  bonus	 forwant  of sufficient profits.  It is true that in  the  Biharcase  it  was  said  that the question	of  bonus  could  beconsidered on industry-wise and not on unit wise basis,	 butthat  only meant that one formula was evolved for the  wholeof  Bihar and applied to every mill in that area.   That  iswhat exactly the Full Bench formula also has done, for it isthe  same formula which applies to all	industrial  concernsall  over the country now after the decision of this  Court.In  the Bihar case, an argument was addressed to  apply	 theFull Bench formula, but that was not accepted on the  groundthat  balance sheets and profit and loss accounts  were	 notreliable and therefore bonus was linked with production.  Inthe Bihar case also some factories were exempted from payingbonus  presumably on the ground that they were unable to  doso  not having made profits.  These cases therefore are	 notinstances  of real industry-cum-region approach.   Referencewas  also made to The, Textile Mills in Coimbatore  Districtv.  Their Workmen (2) relating to Coimbatore textile  mills.In  that case the industrial court considered whether  bonusat  a  flat  rate for all the mills  should  be	 awarded  orwhether	 a  distinction	 should be made	 between  mills	 andmills.	 It  held that the mills themselves when  they	paidbonus  observed or maintained no distinction;  therefore  inthe  peculiar circumstances of that case a uniform  rate  of33-1/3 per cent. was awarded for all the mills as  speciallyall the mills had(1) [1952] 1 L. L. J. 615.(2) [1950] 2 L. L. J. 203.15without	 exception  'made unique profits.  As we  have	saidalready	 the  basic concept of profit bonus, as	 it  appearsfrom the judgments of this Court, is that there should be anavailable  surplus of profits in a particular concern  in  aparticular  year,  to which the bonus relates  and  on	thisbasic concept there is no scope for an approach on the basisof  industry-cum-region in the matter of bonus in the  sensethat  every  mill  in a region should pay  the	same  bonus.There  is  therefore  no question  of  industry-  cum-regionapproach  in the present case, and even the formula  in	 theAgreement is not on a real industry-cum-region approach	 andhas  to be worked out from mill to mill, which is  like	 theFull  Bench  formula.  The reasons therefore which  led	 theindustrial court in this case to distinguish and depart fromthe  decision  of  this	 Court	in  The	 Associated   CementCompanies'  case (1) do not appear to us to  be	 substantialand  there was therefore no ground for departing  from	thatdecision for those reasons.This brings us to a consideration of the formula as providedin  the Agreement and the Full Bench formula as approved  bythis  Court.  It was urged on behalf of the respondent	thatthe two formulae were basically the same; both provided	 forprior  charges	and  in both bonus was to  be  paid  on	 theavailability of surplus profits, though it was admitted thatin  certain respects there were differences.  Now  if  thesedifferences were merely of detail and did not affect some ofthe vital aspects of the Full Bench formula it might be saidthat  there was no ignoring of the law as laid down by	thisCourt  and  therefore the tribunal was	not  unjustified  inextending the Agreement for a year.  But a comparison of theformula	 in the Agreement with the Full Bench formula  showsdifferences  in	 three vital aspects.  In the  first  place,rehabilitation	provided  in the Agreement  differs  vitallyfrom  rehabilitation as explained in The  Associated  CementCompanies case (1).  In the second place, the formula in theAgreement  provides  for  payment of a	minimum	 bonus	eventhough there may be no available surplus and even though theparticular mill might have made actual(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.16loss.  Thirdly, while the Full-Bench formula as approved  bythis  Court  treats a particular year  as  a  selfsufficientunit,  there  is  provision for set-off and  set-on  in	 theformula in the Agreement.  Can it therefore be said that theformula	 in  the  Agreement which  departs  in	these  vitalparticulars  from  the Full Bench formula in the  matter  ofbonus  could be extended for another year by the  industrialcourt in the face of the decisions of this Court laying downthe  law  as to what profit bonus is and how  it  should  beworked	out?   The tribunal therefore when it  extended	 theformula in the Agreement which departed from the Full  Benchformula	 in certain vital aspects was  undoubtedly  ignoringthe  industrial	 law as laid down by this  Court  and  goingagainst it.  It was its duty when dealing with the  questionof profit bonus to apply the Full Bench formula, as approvedby this Court and then arrive at the quantum of bonus to  beawarded	 in  the  case	of  each  mill.	  In  particular  byextending  the Agreement the tribunal made it  possible	 forpayment	 of  a	minimum bonus even  when  there	 was  eitherinsufficient available surplus to pay bonus or no  availablesurplus	 at all or even actual loss; the tribunal  was	thusdefinitely  going  against the industrial  law	relating  tobonus as laid down by this Court.  It had in our opinion  nopower  to do so and the reasons which it gave for  departingfrom  the law laid down by this Court are unsubstantial	 anddo not commend themselves to us.  In these circumstances theorder  of  the tribunal extending the Agreement for  a	yearcannot be upheld.Further	 it  was  urged	 that  in  any	case  the  Agreementcontemplates payment of bonus out of profits of the industryat Ahmedabad as a whole and that is why it has provided	 forset-off	 and  set-on.	Whatever  may  be  said	 about	thisprovision on a long term basis, the tribunal's	jurisdictionwas  limited by its terms of reference.	 There was  not	 onereference  before the tribunal on industry-cum-region  basisbut  sixty-six	separate references, one  relating  to	eachmill.  It was required to consider the question of bonus foreach mill for the year 1958 only and thus had nothing to17do with set-off and set-on or the profits of the industry asa whole at Ahmedabad.  The tribunal was only concerned	with1958  and no consideration as to what happened	before	thatyear  or  what may happen after 1958 could  enter  into	 itsdecision  of the question of bonus for the year	 1958.	 Theprinciple of set-off and set-on therefore to be found in theAgreement could not convert payment of bonus for 1958,	say,by a loss making mill into profit bonus as laid down by	 thedecisions of this Court.  The tribunal's award in this	casetherefore would clearly be against the law as to bonus	laiddown  by this Court, for its jurisdiction was confined	onlyto the year 1958 and no more.It was however urged on behalf of the respondent that  thereis  a fifth kind of bonus, namely, goodwill bonus  and	thatthe   Agreement	 when  it  provides  for  a  minimum   bonusirrespective  of availability of profits provides  for	suchbonus in the interest of industrial peace.  It is enough  tosay  that  so  far  as what  is	 called	 goodwill  bonus  isconcerned  it pre-supposes that it is given by the  employerout  of	 his  own free will without  any  compulsion  by  anindustrial  court.  As its very name implies it is  a  bonuswhich  is given by the employer out of his free	 consent  inorder  that  there  may	 be goodwill  between  him  and	 hisworkmen; but there can be no question of imposing a goodwillbonus by industrial courts, as imposition of such a bonus isa  contradiction  of  its very	concept.   We  have  alreadyreferred  to  four  kinds  of bonus  which  prevail  in	 theindustrial   law   in  India  and  which  can	in   certaincircumstances be imposed by industrial tribunals; but  therecan  be	 no  question of the  imposition  of  the  so-calledgoodwill bonus, for that bonus depends upon the goodwill  ofthe  parties and on their free consent.	 In the	 absence  ofsuch free consent, there can be no question of any  goodwillbonus.Before we part with these appeals, however, we must  brieflyadvert to the general considerations which have been pressedbefore us very strongly by Mr. Vasavada for the	 respondentsand  Mr. Ambekar for the intervening parties.  It  has	beenurged before us18that we should be reluctant to interfere with the  agreementbecause	 it has worked satisfactorily in Ahmedabad, and	 thereversal of the award under appeal may lead to discontent ina very important centre of.textile industry in this country.It  has	 also  been strenuously argued	that  the  Agreementoffers	a very reasonable solution to the vexed	 problem  ofbonus  and the pattern set by it has been copied in  Bombay,Madhya Pradesh and Coimbatore.	If the pattern thus set	 fordetermining the textile employees' claim for bonus has	beenadopted	 by  a substantial part of the textile	industry  inthis  country, the Court should desist from  disturbing	 thesmooth	working of the said pattern unless it is  com-pelledto  do	so.  It may be conceded that some  features  of	 theAgreement  are	undoubtedly  very  reasonable  and  in	 theinterest of the industry as a whole.  The agreement has	 puta ceiling on bonus and that is a term very much in favour ofthe  employer,	because in some cases  where  the  availablesurplus	 is very large, then under the working of  the	FullBench  formula	the  employees are  tempted  to	 claim,	 andindustrial  tribunals  are  justified in  awarding,  a	pro-portionately  substantial amount as bonus reaching  or	evenexceeding  in some cases the level of basic wages of even  8or  9  months.	 This  trend  has  been	 controlled  by	 theAgreement.   It	 is  true that the  Agreement  requires	 thepayment of the minimum bonus but this provision is  intendedto  work  as a part of the larger agreement  spreading	oversome  years and the employer has agreed to pay	the  minimumbonus  even  though  in a particular year  he  may  have  noavailable  surplus, because he and his employees  expect  oranticipate  that the employer may have available surplus  inthe succeeding year.  The working of the Agreement is reallyintended  to spread over a number of years and	the  accountbetween	 the employers and the employees in that  behalf  isconceived  as  a  continuing  and  running  account.   Thesefeatures of the Agreement may be regarded as commendable.The  problem of rehabilitation which has assumed  a  complexform  has also been attempted to be solved by the  Agreementin a practical way.  The solution19adopted	 by the Agreement in that behalf, it is claimed,  isbased on the historical and factual genesis of the  originalformula	 evolved by the Full Bench of the  Labour  AppellateTribunal  when	it  dealt with the problem  of	the  textileindustry  in Bombay.  The argument is that until  1962,	 theAgreement should be allowed to work when the position may bereviewed at length.  Since this Court delivered its judgmentin  the case of The Associated Cement Companies (1)  it	 hascome  to our notice that in cases where the employer  claimsan  exaggerated	 amount	 for  rehabilitation,  or  where   areasonable  claim  made by the employer in  that  behalf  isunreasonably  challenged  by the employees, the	 dispute  isprotracted.   The  trial  of  the  issue  tends	 to   becomecomplicated,  and  that	 leads	to  bitterness	between	 theparties.  It has been urged before us that time has now comewhen the industrial courts will have to face the problem  ofradically  changing the formula.  It is argued	that  moderneconomic  thought  does not encourage the  theory  that	 thewhole  of  the	rehabilitation amount  must  come  from	 thecurrent profits of the industry, and it was stated before usthat Government may have gradually to step in to assist	 theindustry  by advancing sufficient loans on reasonable  termsto   enable  the  industry  to	meet  the  demand   of	 itsrehabilitation.	 However, as we pointed out in our  decisionin  the	 case of The Associated Cement Companies  (1)  thesematters	 can  be  properly and	effectively  decided  by  anindustrial  court if the major representative industries  inthe country and their employees are brought before it with aproper reference, or it can be tackled more appropriately bya  high-power commission appointed in that behalf.  We	weretold  that the Government of India has taken a	decision  toappoint	 such a commission, and that it would  soon  resolvethis  problem  on  a more  rational  and  scientific  basis.During	the  course  of	 the hearing  of  these	 appeals  wesuggested  to  the  parties  that in  view  of	the  pendingappointment  of	 the  commission,  parties  may	 settle	 thepresent	 dispute amicably and that the	appellant-mills	 mayfall in line with the rest(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.20of  the mills in Ahmedabad, but despite their  best  effortsthe  parties  could  not settle the  dispute  and  wanted  adecision from this Court on the points of law raised in	 thepresent	 appeals;  that	 is why we have had  to	 decide	 thepoints	 of  law,  and	in  doing  so	inevitably   generalconsiderations to which we have just adverted cannot play  amaterial part.In  the	 course of the argument reference was  made  by	 Mr.Ambekar	 to the concept of goodwill bonus; that again  is  amatter which may be evolved by agreement between the partiesor decided by a highpower commission.  If the matter has  tobe  decided according to law as has been laid down  by	thisCourt  then  the  conclusion would  be	inevitable  that  onessential  points the Agreement departs from the Full  Benchformula,  and however commendable it may be on the whole  itcan  continue  only by agreement and cannot be	enforced  byindustrial  adjudication  against  the will of	any  of	 theparties; that is why we have come to the conclusion,  thoughnot without regret, that the appeals must be allowed and thematter	must be sent back to the tribunal for  disposing  ofthe issue before it in accordance with law.  We direct	thatthe tribunal should proceed to try the question whether	 anybonus  should  be awarded to the employees of  the  eighteenmills  before us on the basis of the Full Bench	 formula  asinterpreted  by	 this Court in the case	 of  The  AssociatedCement Companies (1).In the circumstances there will be no order as to costs.SUBBA  RAO,  J.-I  have had the advantage  of  perusing	 thejudgment  prepared  by	my learned brother,  Wanchoo,  J.  Iregret	my  inability  to  agree.  As  mine  is	 a  solitarydissent, it may not serve any useful purpose to elaborate onthe  question raised at great length.  I  would,  therefore,briefly refer to the relevant facts which have already	beenfully  stated  by my learned brother and  express  my  viewsconcisely on the question. presented before us.These  appeals	raise a dispute between the  Textile  LabourAssociation,, Ahmedabad, the representative(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.21union of the textile industry in Ahmedabad, and the  varioustextile	 mills in that area in respect of the bonus  payablefor  the  year 1958.  The said Labour Union entered  into  afive-year pact with the Ahmedabad Mill-Owners'	Association,representing the member mills, in regard to payment of bonusfor the years 1953 to 1957.  The Labour Union demanded bonusfor the year 1958 on the basis of the said pact.  The  mill-owners	claimed that the said pact was contrary to  the	 lawlaid  down by the decision of this Court in the case of	 TheAssociated  Cement  Companies  Ltd.,  Dwarka  Cement  Works,Dwarka	v. Its Workmen (1) and that, if	 the  rehabilitationcost was calculated on the basis of the principles laid downtherein,  there	 would	not be any  "available	surplus"  tosustain the claim for bonus.  The Industrial Court to  whichthe   dispute  was  referred  elaborately.  considered	 thearguments advanced and came to the conclusion that the five-year pact which originated in Ahmedabad was not only fair initself	but  also an important	contribution  to  industrialpeace, and that it did not in any way run counter to the lawlaid down by the Supreme Court.	 On that finding it extendedthe operation of the pact for one more year and directed theparties to file within six weeks from the date of the  awardcalculations  in respect of the bonus payable for  the	year1958,  in the light of its decision and on the footing	thatthe five-year pact was for six years.The  main question in the appeals is whether the  said	pactviolates   the	law  laid  down	 by  this   Court.    Beforeconsidering this contention it would be convenient to noticethe  terms  of the said pact.  The said pact  is  a  lengthydocument, though precisely drawn, and to read it in full  isto  unnecessarily burden the judgment.	I shall,  therefore,briefly summarize its terms.The contracting parties were the Textile Labour	 Associationof  Ahmedabad, a representative union for the local area  ofAhmedabad  on the one part, and the  Ahmedabad	Mill-Owners'Association, Ahmedabad, representing its local member mills,on the other part.(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.22It was executed on June 27, 1955, to cover a period of	fiveyears from 1953 to 1957, inclusive of both years, for  grantof  bonus  to the employees of the Cotton Textile  Mills  ofAhmedabad.   The object of the agreement was to create	goodwill  among the workers and for the purpose  of	 maintainingpeace in the industry.	The basis of the agreement was	thatit applied for the entire Ahmedabad Textile Industry and fora  period  of five years.  The "available surplus"  of	eachmill  was  ascertained	in accordance with  the	 Full  BenchFormula laid down by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in  Mill-Owners'	 Association, Bombay v. The Rashtriya  Mill  MazdoorSangh, Bombay (1).  The maximum bonus payable by every	millof  the	 said area was fixed at 25 per cent.  of  the  totalbasic  wages  earned during the year, and  the	minimum	 wasfixed  at  4.8 per cent. of the said basic wages.  If  in  aparticular  year a mill had an "available surplus"  adequatefor  granting bonus at a higher quantum than the ceiling  of25  per	 cent. of the basic wages. it would  nationally	 setaside  the  part of the residue of the	"available  surplus"after the grant of the maximum bonus not exceeding an amountequivalent to 25 per cent. of the basic wages earned  duringthat year as a reserve for bonus for the purpose of "set-on"(adjustment)   in  subsequent  years.	If  the	  "availablesurplus"  was adequate only to grant bonus at a	 rate  lowerthan  the  ceiling, the quantum of bonus would be  fixed  insuch a manner that there would remain with the mill at leasta  minimum of Rs. 10,000.  If in respect of any year a	millhad  an "available surplus" adequate to pay bonus at a	ratelower  than the minimum rate, it would be entitled to  "set-off"  the excess amount of bonus that would be payable in  asubsequent year or years.  In setting off the said amount ofbonus  that,  would be payable against	subsequent  year  oryears, if the surplus was adequate only to grant bonus at  arate  lower than the maximum rate, the mill would first	 setaside out of the "available surplus" an amount of Rs. 10,000and, then out of the balance, it would further take out	 theexcess amount paid by it as bonus in the previous(1)  [1950] 2 L.L.J. 247.23year,  and then it would distribute the remainder as  bonus.Even if a mill had made a loss in a particular year, it	 hadto pay the minimum bonus, but it would be entitled to  "set-off"  the amount thus paid against the amount of bonus	thatwould  be  payable in the subsequent year or years,  in	 thesame  manner as in the case of a surplus adequate  to  grantbonus  only at a rate lower than 25 per cent. of  the  basicwages.	In short, when the surplus was adequate to pay bonusat 25 per cent. of the basic wages earned during the year, amill  had  to pay the maximum of 25 per cent. of  the  basicwages.	 When  it was adequate only to grant bonus  of	lessthan 25 per cent. of the basic wages, it would pay the	saidbonus  after reserving a sum of Rs. 10,000 for	itself.	  Ifthere  was loss, it would pay the minimum  bonus.   Whateveramounts were paid were adjusted on the principle of "set-on"and  "set-off"	in the subsequent years.  There was  also  aprovision   that  after	 the  prescribed  period   all	 theoutstanding  liabilities under the formula of  "set-on"	 and"set-off"  would come to an end.  Three	 principles  clearlyunderlie the entire scheme, namely, (i) that though for	 thepurpose	 of  ascertaining  the surplus,	 the  profits  of  aparticular mill were taken as the criterion, the position ofthe  entire  Ahmedabad	Textile	 Industry  was	taken	intoconsideration;	(ii)  that the beneficent  features  of	 thescheme	could be gathered only by its long  term  operation;and (iii) that though in a particular year in the case of  aparticular mill there might not be "available surplus",	 theprinciples of "set-on" and "set-off" indicate that the bonuswas linked with profits.  As reasonable men trying to settletheir	disputes,  both	 the  parties,	representing   theirrespective associations, adopted an optimistic attitude	 andproceeded on the basis that the entire industry would make aprofit	and  that  every  mill could  be  expected  to	makereasonable  profits  in	 at least some of  the	five  years,though it might incur loss in other years.  The validity  ofthe agreement should be judged on the basis adopted.In  the Ahmedabad Textile Industry, it is in  evidence,	 theaverage monthly wage for workers in 195724was  Rs. 54.  Fifteen days' basic wages, i.e.,	the  minimumbonus  prescribed under the pact, would come to	 an  averagetotal wages for 5 days; and 3 months' basic wages would cometo  19	days' total wages on the average.  Prima  facie	 thebonus  fixed  is very reasonable and cannot be	said  to  beoppressive to the mill-owners.The   said  bonus  agreement,  by  its	reasonableness	 andbeneficent effects on the industry, attracted the  attentionof  other  mills throughout India.  Exhibit  U-2  shows	 theparticulars of other mills which have adopted the agreement.The Bombay Textile Industry, The Madhya Bharat	Mill-owners'Association,  The Modi Spinning & Weaving Mills,  Modinagar,and the cotton mills at Surendranagar (Saurashtra)' Sidhpur,Viramgam Nadiad and Petlad, Cambay Baroda, Surat adopted thesaid scheme with suitable modifications.  The silk  industryin  Bombay  and	 the  plantation  industry  in	Madras	alsoaccepted  the principles underlying the said agreement.	  Weare told that even the Coimbatore area has recently  adopteda similar agreement.The  fact  that the said five year pact was followed  by  somany other mills is a fair indication that it was  basicallysound  and  capable of yielding good  results.	 Experiencedmembers	 of the Industrial Courts spoke highly of the  pact.Late  Shri  S. H. Naik, a Member of  the  Industrial  Court,adopted	 the  pact  in a dispute between  the  Bombay  Mill-Owners'	 Association and the Rashtriya Mill  Mazdoor  Sangh,and in making an award in terms of a similar pact, made	 thefollowing observations:	      "This  award, based upon an agreement  arrived	      at  as  a result of persistent  and  continued	      efforts  on  the	part of	 both  the  parties,	      keeping	in  view  the  prosperity   of	 the	      employers	 as  well as the well-being  of	 the	      employees,  will	go  down  in  history  as  a	      significant landmark in collective bargaining.	      It augurs well for the future of the industry,	      as    well   as	those	employed    therein,	      particularly  in view of the ambitious  Second	      Five  Year  Plan	on which  the  country	will	      shortly launch.  It also avoids, for	      25	      some  time,  and let us hope for all  time  to	      come, the bonus dispute which cropped up every	      year  since  1947.  I  congratulate  both	 the	      parties and compliment them on the  successful	      termination of their efforts to bring peace to	      the  industry  and  set  an  example  to	 the	      employers and employees in the country."The said weighty observations apply mutatis mutandis to	 theagreement   in	question.   Shri  H.  V.  Divatia,   anotherexperienced Member of the Industrial Court, in his award  onthe  bonus dispute of the Ahmedabad Textile Mills  for	1952observed:	      "Ever since the former practice of taking	 all	      the  textile mills in one centre as  one	unit	      for  the purpose of determining the bonus	 was	      given  up, there has been	 dissatisfaction  on	      both  sides on the bonus question	 every	year	      and  in  my view this change as  well  as	 the	      formula	set  up	 by  the  Labour   Appellate	      Tribunal	have  made the bonus  issue  a	very	      complicated  one	resulting in  bitterness  on	      both the sides instead of promoting peace	 and	      harmony between the employers and workers.   I	      hope  the whole matter is reconsidered at	 the	      highest  level.  If bonus is to be  given,  it	      must be awarded in such a way that it does not	      defeat its purpose."The agreement did nothing more than reverting to the  formerpractice  of taking all the textile mills in one  centre  asone  unit for the purpose of determining. the bonus,  thoughfor  ascertaining the quantum of bonus payable the  balance-sheets of individual units were taken into consideration.In  making  the	 present award the  Industrial	Court  on  aconsideration  of the entire material placed before it	cameto a definite finding that on the. whole the five-year	pacthad  worked  fairly  for  both	the  parties  and  that	 theextension of the said agreement for one more year would helpin promoting peace in that industry in Ahmedabad and  thatowing to the goodwill created by the five- year bonus  pact,the  industry also benefited by schemes of  rationalization.It  was	 also  brought to our notice  that  in	the  textileindustry426in  Ahmedabad  area  there were never  any  strike  and	 thedisputes  in the recent years were settled  amicably  acrossthe  table.In  such a situation this Court was	asked  underArt.  136 of the Constitution to set aside the award and  tobring  about  chaos  where peace existed  and  to  introduceunrest and disharmony where stability and harmony prevailed.It  was said that this Court had no option but to do  so  asthe  agreement	was  contrary to law as laid  down  by	thisCourt.	 I shall now examine briefly the relevant  decisionslaying	down  the  principle governing	bonus  to  ascertainwhether	 the impugned agreement is in any  way	inconsistentwith them.In  Muir  Mills	 Co. Limited v. Suti  Mills  Mazdoor  Union,Kanpur (1) this Court defined the term "bonus" and laid downthe conditions which would give rise to the claim for bonus.Bhagwati,  J., after considering the relevant decisions	 andtext books on the subject, accepted the following definitionof "bonus" given by the Textile Labour Inquiry Committee:	      "The  term bonus is applied to a cash  payment	      made  in	addition  to  wages.   It  generally	      represents    the	  cash	  incentive    given	      conditionally   on   certain   standards	  of	      attendance and efficiency being attained."	      The  learned Judge then proceeded to state  at	      p. 998 thus:	      "There  are however two conditions which	have	      to be satisfied before a demand for bonus	 can	      be justified and they are: (1) when wages fall	      short  of	 the  living standard  and  (2)	 the	      industry makes huge profits part of which	 are	      due to the contribution which the workmen make	      in  increasing  production.   The	 demand	 for	      bonus becomes an industrial claim when  either	      or both these conditions are satisfied."The  learned Judge then referred to the formula	 evolved  bythe Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in the Mill-Owners'	 Association,  Bombay  v.  Rashtreeya  Mill  MazdoorSangh,	Bombay	(2) and narrated the first  charges  on	 thegross profits as laid. down by(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 991.(2) [1950] 2 L.L.J. 247.27that  decision.	 The learned Judge then expressed  his	viewthus at p. 999:	      "It  is  therefore clear that  the  claim	 for	      bonus can be made by the employees only if  as	      a result of the joint contribution of  capital	      and  labour the industrial concern has  earned	      profits.	 If  in	 any  particular  year	 the	      working of the industrial concern has resulted	      in  loss there is no basis  nor  justification	      for  a  demand  for bonus.   Bonus  is  not  a	      deferred wage."This  decision lays down in clear terms that the payment  ofbonus  is linked with profits.	But this decision was  givenin a dispute between one specified mill, namely, Muir  MillsCo. Limited and the Union, representing its employees.	ThisCourt  was  not	 considering  a case of	 a  bonus  claim  onindustry-cum-region  basis.  The principle of the  decision,namely, that the claim for bonus is linked with profits, mayequally	 apply	to  such  a case; but  the  working  of	 theprinciple must necessarily depend upon the peculiarities  ofsuch a claim.  Industrial law is in the process of evolutionand  it	 cannot	 be put in a straight jacket,  but  must  beallowed	 to  grow to meet varying  situations  that  presentthemselves to industrial tribunals, subject of course to thestatutory provisions and the general principles laid down bycourts.	 The application of the principles laid down by thisdecision  to  a	 bonus claim  on  industry-cum-region  basis-would, to some extent, be different from its application toa  single  unit.  I shall consider this aspect	at  a  laterstage  of the judgment.	 It is unnecessary to  consider	 theother  decisions on this subject except the recent  decisionof  this  Court	 in The Associated  Cement  Companies  Ltd.,Dwarka	Cement	Works, Dwarka v. Its Workmen  That  decisionreviewed the entire law on the subject vis-a-vis the  profitbonus.	 It  accepted the principles laid down by  the	saidFull  Bench Formula and elaborately considered the  mode  ofapplication  of	 the  prin.  ciples  for  ascertaining	 the"available  surplus." Gajendragadkar, J., who spoke for	 theCourt,	referred  to the earlier decision and  restated	 thebasis for awarding bonus thus at p. 995:(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.28	      "We have already noticed that the formula	 for	      awarding	bonus  to workmen is  based  on	 two	      considerations: first, that labour is entitled	      to claim a share in the trading profits of the	      industry because it has partially	 contributed	      to  the  same;  and  second,  that  labour  is	      entitled	to  claim that the gap	between	 its	      actual wage and the living wage should  within			    reasonable limits be filled up."Then  the  learned  Judge, after referring  to	the  earlierdecisions, gave the various amounts that should be  deductedfrom the bonus-year's profits and the 'manner in which	theyshould	be  done  to ascertain the  "available	surplus."According  to the learned Judge the following items have  tobe deducted:	      "(1)   Depreciation,  which  should   be	 the	      notional normal depreciation.	      (2)   Income-tax.	      (3)   A  return on paid-up capital as well  as	      working capital.	Though the usual rates	were	      mentioned,  it was made clear that  the  rates	      were  not inflexible but would vary  according	      to the circumstances of each case.	      (4)   Rehabilitation:  For  ascertaining	 the	      amount  necessary for rehabilitation,  it	 was	      pointed  out  that a  multiplier	and  divisor	      should be adopted; the former to ascertain the	      probable	price which may have to be paid	 for	      the     rehabilitation,	  replacement	  or	      modernization of machinery, and the latter  in	      order  to ascertain the annual requirement  of	      the employer in that behalf year by year."Out  of	 the  balance, which  was  described  as  "availablesurplus",  it  was stated that three  parties,	namely,	 thelabour, the industry and the shareholders, were entitled  to-claim	shares.	  This is the broad picture  drawn  by	thatdecision  for fixing the bonus.	 That  decision,  therefore,restated  the pre-existing law and reaffirmed  the  doctrinethat  bonus is linked with profits and also the	 Full  BenchFormula	 for  ascertaining the	"available  surplus".	Thatdecision  was also not concerned with a claim for  bonus  onindustry-cum-region  basis, but only with a claim in  regardto  a  particular  unit.   It also did	not  lay  down	thatemployer and29employee  could not agree in regard to the  distribution  ofthe  available surplus or in respect of the amount  requiredfor rehabilitation.  It also did not purport to prevent	 theparties	 from agreeing on the payment of bonus	linked	withprofits on industry-cum-region basis spread over a number ofyears.	 Some of the observations in the  judgment  indicatethe consciousness of the court that the formula accepted  orthe  directions given therein could not meet every  conceiv-able situation that might arise in the complicated field  ofindustrial relations.Does the impugned pact contravene the law laid down by	thisCourt?	It is contended that it infringes the law mainly  inthree respects, namely, (i) bonus was payable thereunder  bya  mill	 incurring loss; (ii) the pact did not	provide	 forrehabilitation	of  the	 post-1947  block;  and	 (iii)	 thedepreciation  and the interest on the reserves allowed	werenot in accordance with the formula.The  first  objection appears to be plausible and  has	alsobeen upheld by my learned brethren.  But, in my view,  thereis a fallacy underlying it.  The contention invokes the	 lawof  bonus  laid down in respect of an industrial  claim	 forbonus  for  a  particular year made by the  employees  of  asingle mill and seeks to apply it to a case of an  agreementevolving  a  scheme of bonus on the basis  of  industry-cum-region spread over a reasonable period of time.	 Though	 thefundamental  principle,	 namely, that bonus is	linked	withprofits, applies to both, the application of the same to twodifferent  situations  must necessarily differ.	  The  shortquestion  is whether under the impugned agreement the  claimfor  bonus  was not based on profits.  The agreement  was  amultilateral  one involving mutual obligations.	 It  was  onindustry-cum-region  basis,  that is, it  was  entered	intobetween	 the  employers	 of  the  entire  industry  and	 theemployees thereof.  The basis of the agreement was that	 theentire	industry  would make a profit.	For the	 purpose  ofconvenient  payment of bonus it was worked out on  the	unitbasis.	All the parties to the agreement, the employers	 andthe30employees  of  different  mills in  Ahmedabad,	desired	 in-dustrial  peace in order to build up the  textile  industry.The industry comprised many units with varying prospects anddifferent  strata  of financial	 stability  and	 prosperity.Some mills may earn profits throughout the period, some	 mayearn profits in some years and incur loss in other years andunder extremely unfortunate and unexpected circumstances,  amill  may incur loss throughout.  Though  a,particular	millmay earn abnormal profits, another mill may be just able  tomake its both ends meet and another may have a narrow marginof  profits  or	 even  incur loss.  But	 all  of  them	weresincerely  interested  in  the	general	 prosperity  of	 theindustry  as a whole in the said area which would  have	 itsrepercussions on individual units.  A mill which earns largeprofits	 may  have to pay more than 25 per  cent.  of  basicwages for the year as bonus and a mill which incurs loss maynot have to pay bonus at all.  The employees of a particularmill may be entitled in a particular year, having regard  tothe  profits, to get bonus far in excess of 25 per cent.  ofthe  basic  wages.   But  in the  general  interest  of	 allconcerned, they were all willing to make a little  sacrificefor  the common good.  Each mill undertook the liability  topay bonus to its employees with a minimum and maximum limitsin  consideration of a similar undertaking of  liability  byother  mills.  So too, the employees, in consideration of  aminimum bonus being guaranteed to them, agreed not to  claimmore  than  the	 maximum  fixed and the	 mills	as  a  wholeguaranteed  payment  of	 the minimum  bonus.   But  what  isimportant  to remember is that the entire scheme of  paymentof  bonus was linked with profits.  It would be paid on	 thebasis  of  profits earned or to be earned by a mill.   If  amill did not make profits in a particular year, bonus  wouldbe paid on account to be adjusted in subsequent years.	 Theformula	 of "set-on" and "set-off" emphasizes  the  integralconnection between bonus and profits, and the fact that	 thetotal  loss incurred by a particular mill during the  entireperiod may break that formula does not affect the basis of31the   agreement.   In  effect  and  substance,	 under	 theagreement,  each of the mills agreed for a consideration  onthe  happening of a contingency to treat certain amounts  asnotional  profits adequate to pay the minimum bonus  with  aright  to  "set-off"  in  subsequent  years  against  largerprofits, if any, earned by them.  In the premises, it is notcorrect	 to state that bonus is not linked with profits	 forfour  reasons,	namely, (i) the agreement  was	between	 theemployers  and employees of the entire textile	industry  inAhmedabad;  (ii)  the basis of the agreement  was  that	 theindustry  as a whole would make a profit; there	 is  nothingillegal	 in  parties  to the agreement,	 who  had  ,intimateknowledge of the financial position of the entire  industry,from  accepting that position; (iii) instead of the  profitsof  the entire industry being ascertained and bonus paid  toall  the  employees, under the agreement, each	mill  for  aconsideration,	namely,	 obligations  undertaken  by   otherparties, agreed to pay bonus ranging between a maximum and aminimum; and (iv) each mill also agreed for a consideration,even if in fact it incurred a loss in a particular year., toset  apart a notional amount as profits adequate to pay	 theminimum bonus with a right to readjust its bonus account  insubsequent  years.  In this view the impugned pact does	 notcontravene  the law of the land for the simple	reason	thatthere is no decision of this Court which prevents the makingof  ouch agreements so long as the fundamental principle  isnot violated; and in this case, for the reason given by	 me,I  am of the view that the said principle, viz., that  bonusshould	be  linked with profits has been adhered to  in	 theagreement.Now  let us see whether the Full Bench Formula in regard  torehabilitation	has been contravened by the  impugned  pact.The  main  emphasis  is on the want of a  provision  in	 theagreement in regard to valuation of the block subsequent  to1947.	In  The Associated Cement Companies' case  (1)	thisCourt observed at p. 971 thus:	      "it  has	also  been observed  by	 the  Labour	      Appellate	 Tribunal  that	 if  an	 appropriate	      multiplier and	      (1)   [1959] S.C.R. 925.	      32	      divisor are determined they are generally used	      because  the tribunals take the view that	 the	      reconsideration  of  the said  multiplier	 and	      divisor  should not be hastily undertaken	 and	      could  be	 justified only on the	basis  of  a	      stable character extending or likely to extend	      over  a  sufficient number of years so  as  to	      make a definite and appreciable difference  in	      the cost of replacement."The  Industrial	 Court	in the bonus. case  of	the  textileindustry  at Ahmedabad for the year 1949 fixed the  cost  ofreplacement of the block of the entire industry at Ahmedabadat  Rs.	 33.89 crores spread over 15 years from	 1947.	 TheIndustrial  Court, on the material placed before  it,  fixedthe multiplier at 2.7 and the divisor at 15.  The result  isthat the cost of the machinery and building as it existed in1947  was multiplied by 2.7 and after making  the  necessarydeduction  therefrom,  such  as	 that  of  depreciation	 andreserves  available  and the breakdown value  of  machinery,divided the surplus by 15 years.  Ordinarily, change in	 thesaid  multiplier  and divisor, as laid down by	this  Court,should not be hastily undertaken and could be justified onlyon  the basis of a substantial change of a stable  characterextending  or likely to extend over a sufficient  number  ofyears.	In the impugned pact the parties agreed to abide  bythe  said multiplier and divisor and they did not think	 fitto  revise  the same.  The decisions of this  Court  do	 notpreclude   employers  and  employees  from  agreeing  to   aparticular valuation of the block or to their agreeing to  aparticular  multiplier	and 'divisor having  regard  to	 thecircumstances obtaining at the time of the agreement.Nor  does the agreement infringe any of the principles	laiddown  by the Full Bench Formula in the matter of fixing	 theprior charges.	A perusal of paragraph 2(a) of the agreementshows  that  the prior charges mentioned  therein  are	onlythose  that  are stated in the Full  Bench  Formula,  thoughthere  is  certainly a difference in the  particulars  underdifferent  heads,  such as, interest,  etc.   Certainly	 thedecisions of this Court do not preclude the parties from33agreeing  to  certain  amounts or  to  certain	rates  underdifferent heads of prior charges.As the agreement does not infringe the law laid down by thisCourt,	it  cannot be contended that  the  Industrial  Courtcould  not extend the said agreement, if it is necessary  tosecure	industrial  peace for another year.  In	 effect	 andsubstance,  the Industrial Court adopted the said  agreementas  a  part of the award by giving it a span  of  six  yearsinstead	 of  five  years; with the result  that	 the  entireformula of "set-on" and "set-off" would automatically  applyin the sixth year.  Courts have held that Industrial  Courtshave  power  to	 extend agreements  in	appropriate  circum-stances.The  Federal  Court  of India in  Western  India  AutomobileAssociation v. Industrial Tribunal, Bombay (1) explained thescope  of  industrial adjudication and the functions  of  anindustrial tribunal in labour disputes thus at p. 345:	      "Adjudication  does not, in our opinion,	mean	      adjudication  according to the strict  law  of	      master and servant.  The award of the Tribunal	      may  contain  provisions for settlement  of  a	      dispute  which no Court could order if it	 was	      bound by ordinary law, but the Tribunal is not	      fettered in any way by these limitations.	  In			    Volume  1  of 'Labour Disputes  and	 Collective	      Bargaining'  by Ludwig Teller, it is  said  at	      page  536,  'that industrial  arbitration	 may	      involve the extension of an existing agreement	      or the making of a new one, or in general	 the	      creation	of new obligations or  modifications	      of  old  ones,  while  commercial	 arbitration	      generally concerns itself with  interpretation	      of existing obligations and disputes  relating	      to  existing agreements'.	 In our opinion,  it	      is a true statement about the functions of  an	      Industrial Tribunal in labour disputes."The same view in different phraseology has been expressed bythis Court in Bohtas Industries Limited v. Brijnandan Pandey(2),  S. K. Das, J., speaking for the Court, observed at  p.810 thus:(1) [1949] F.C.R- 321.	     (2) [1956] S.C.R. 800.534	      "A  Court of law proceeds on the footing	that	      no   power  exists  in  the  courts  to	make	      contracts	 for  people; and the  parties	must	      make  their own contracts.  The  courts  reach	      their   limit  of	 power	when  they   enforce	      contracts	 which	the parties have  made.	  An	      Industrial Tribunal is not so fettered and may	      create new obligations or modify contracts  in	      the interests of industrial peace, to  protect	      legitimate  trade	 union	activities  and	  to	      prevent unfair practice or victimization.	  We	      cannot,  however, accept the extreme  position	      canvassed	  before  us  that   an	  Industrial	      Tribunal	can  ignore altogether	an  existing	      agreement or existing obligations for no rhyme	      or reason whatsoever."This  Court again reiterated the same principle in the	caseof Patna Electricity Supply Co. Limited (1) thus at p. 1038:	      "There  is no doubt that in appropriate  cases	      industrial   adjudication	  may	impose	 new	      obligations on the employer in the interest of	      social justice and with the object of securing	      peace and harmony between the employer and his	      workmen  and  full cooperation  between  them.	      This view about the jurisdiction and power  of	      Industrial  Tribunals  has  been	consistently	      recognized in this country since the  decision	      of   the	Federal	 Court	in   Western   India	      Automobile Association v. Industrial Tribunal,	      Bombay (2)".These authorities clearly establish the proposition that  anIndustrial Tribunal can extend an existing agreement or makea  new one if, for good reasons, it comes to the  conclusionthat  such  extension promotes industrial peace.  If,  as  Ihave  held,  the  impugned  pact  was  lawful  and  did	 notcontravene  the law laid down by this Court, the  IndustrialCourt in the present case was certainly within its rights toextend that pact for another year for the very good  reasonsgiven by it for doing so.I  shall  now  state my view in the form  of  the  followingpropositions:  (1)  Neither the Full Bench Formula  nor	 thedecisions of this Court affirming it preclude an(1) [1959] SUPP. 2 S.C.R. 76r.(2) [1949] F.C.R. 321.35Industrial  Court  in appropriate cases from  extending	 theterms  of  a pact by another year if that was  necessary  tomaintain  industrial  peace. (2) The law laid  down  by	 theFederal Court and the Supreme Court recognizes such a  powerin  an	Industrial Court. (3) The fact that  the  subsequentblock has not been valued does not affect the question,	 forthe  parties can certainly agree, for various reasons,	thatthe value of the existing block should govern the  situationfor  a specified period. (4) The impugned five-year pact  isnot  contrary to industrial law as laid down by this  Court;indeed,	 it expressly followed the principles laid  down  inthe  Full Bench Formula which was subsequently	affirmed  bythis  Court in the case of Associated Cement Companies	(1).(5)  The impugned pact also does not infringe the  principlethat bonus depends upon profits; but it applied the same  byevolving   a  formula  of  "set-on"  and  "set-off"   to   acomplicated situation of the entire industry in a particulararea for a number of years.For  the  foregoing reasons, and in view  of  the  aforesaiddefinite findings of the Industrial Court, I hold that	thisis eminently a fit case for extending the agreement for	 thebonus year 1958.Before closing I must express my appreciation of the way  inwhich  the  impugned  pact was	brought	 about	between	 theparties.   It is in the interest of both the  employers	 andthe employees-while the employees of every mill are  assuredof  payment of a minimum bonus, the employers of every	millalso are assured protection against extravagant claims.	 Theagreement  avoided complicated and acrimonious	disputes  incourts	every year in regard to bonus.	The working of	thisagreement   certainly  helped  the  mills  to  achieve	 theintroduction  of schemes of rationalization.  The  agreementhas become a model one for other mills.	 Ironically the FullBench  Formula,	 affirmed  by  this Court  in  the  case  ofAssociated  Cement Companies Limited (1), mainly evolved  tofix  the amount required for rehabilitation in the  interestof industrial peace, turned out to be the sheet-anchor for(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.36the  employers	to depart from the path of  negotiation	 andagreement  which they were following all these years and  toenter  the arena of open fight with the employees.   It	 maybe, though it may turn out to be wrong, that they are  underthe  belief  that  the	Full  Bench  Formula,  if   strictlyfollowed, would not leave any surplus and that they need notpay any bonus to the employees.This  attitude is neither reasonable nor in the interest  ofindustrial  peace.   I hope and trust that the	parties,  inspite  of the temporary success in these appeals, would	 seebetter	light  and settle their disputes as  they  had	beendoing all these years.In  the	 result,  the appeals fail and	are  dismissed	withcosts.By  COURT : In accordance with the opinion of the  majority,the  appeals  are allowed and the matter sent  back  to	 theTribunal for disposing of the issue before it in  accordancewith law.  We direct that the Tribunal should proceed to trythe  question  whether any bonus should be  awarded  to	 theemployees  of the eighteen mills before us on the  basis  ofthe  Full Bench Formula as interpreted by this Court in	 thecase of The Associated Cement Companies (1).In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.Appeals allowed.Cases remanded to the Tribunal.(1) [1959] S.C.R. 925.37
