The  assessees  produced  their  cash-bookentries	 from the 20th December, 1946, to the 18th  January,1946,  which  were  accepted as correct	 by  the  Income-taxOfficer,  who,	however,  made no further  scrutiny  of	 theaccounts,  and,the  entries  showed  that  on  the  12th  ofJanuary, 1946, the cash balance in hand was Rs.	 69,891-2-6.The  case of the appellants was that the said notes  were  apart  of  the cash balance and in further support  of  theircase -they filed before the Appellate Assistant Commissionerthree affidavits by persons actually making the payments, inrespect	 of certain entries in the cash-book to	 prove	thatRs. 20,000 on the 28th December, 1946, Rs. 15,000 on the 6thof January, 1946, and Rs. 8,000, out of a sum of Rs.  8,500,on  the	 6th of January, 1946, were paid  in  thousand-rupeenotes.	 The Income-tax Officer and the Appellate  AssistantCommissioner in appeal, on a calculation of their own,	heldthat  the possession by the appellants of so many  thousand-rupee  notes was an impossibility and that these notes	mustrepresent  income from, undisclosed sources and as  such  beadded  to the assessable income of the appellants.   Neitherthe  Appellate	Assistant Commissioner	nor  the  Income-taxOfficer,  who  was  present at the hearing  of	the  appeal,called for the deponents in order to cross-examine them withreference  to  their  statement	 in  the  affidavits.	 TheAppellate,  Tribunal on appeal accepted the  explanation  ofthe  assesses  in respect of 31 of the notes  but  not	withregard	to  the rest and rejected their	 application  for  areference  of the matter to the High Court.   The  assesseesmoved the High Court and the Tribunal was directed under  s.66(2) to state627a  case for its decision.  In answering the  main  question,the  High Court was of the opinion that the finding  of	 theTribunal was a finding of fact or an inference based on suchfinding and it was not possible to say that such finding  orinference was unreasonable or arbitrary.Held  (per  curiam),  that the High Court was  in  error  inrefusing to interfere with the finding of the Tribunal whichwas based on no evidence and the appeal must succeed.Per  C.J. and BHAGWATI J.-Conclusions based on facts  provedor  admitted  may  be  conclusions of  fact  but  whether  aparticular  inference  can legitimately be drawn  from	suchconclusions  may be a question of law. Where,  however,	 thefact  finding  authority has acted without any	evidence  orupon  a	 view  of  the	facts  which  could  not  reasonablybe  entertained or the facts found were such that no  personacting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevantlaw could have found, the court is entitled to interfere.Chunilal Ticamchand Coal Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar and Orissa, ([1955]) 27 I.T.R. 602), applied.Cameron	 v.  Prendergast  (Inspector of	 Taxes),  ([1940]  8I.T.R. (Suppl.) 75), Bomford v. Osborne (H.  M. Inspector ofTaxes),	  ([1942]  10  I.T.R.  (Suppl.)	 27)   and   Edwards(Inspector  of	Taxes) v. Bairstow and Another,	 ([1955]  28I.T.R. 579), referred to.The  High Court was in error in treating the finding of	 theTribunal  as a finding of fact and failed to apply the	trueprinciples of interference applicable to such cases.The  entries  in cash-book and the statements  made  in	 theaffidavits in support of the explanation. which were bindingon  the Revenue and could not be questioned, clearly  showedthat  it was quite within the range of possibility that	 theappellants had in their possession the 61 high	denominationnotes  on the relevant date and their explanation could	 notbe assailed by a purely imaginary calculation of the  naturemade  by the Income-tax Officer or the	Appellate  AssistantCommissioner.The  Tribunal made a wrong approach and while accepting	 theappelants'  explanation with regard to 31 of the  notes,  ithad absolutely no reason to exclude the rest as not  coveredby  it in absence of any evidence to show that the  excludednotes were profits earned by the appellants from undisclosedsources.    The	  appellants  having  given   a	  reasonableexplanation  the Tribunal could not, by applying a  rule  ofthumb, discard it so far as the rest were concerned and	 acton mere surmise.Per  VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-The finding of the  Tribunal	thathigh denomination notes of the value Rs. 30,000	 representedconcealed profits of the appellants being unsupported by anyevidence  amounted to an error of law and was liable  to  beset  aside.  That so many notes of high denomination  shouldhave been held as part of628the cash for so long a time, might be highly suspicious	 butdecisions  must	 be founded on legal testimony	and  not  onsuspicion.The question whether the accounts were genuine or not was  apure  question of fact and a finding that they were  genuinewas binding both on the Revenue and the subject.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 81 of 1954.Appeal from the judgment and order dated the 10th March 1953of  the Bombay High Court in Income-tax Reference No. 35  of1952.B.   J. Kolah and I. N. Shroff for the appellant.G.   N.	 Joshi,	 Porus	A. Mehta and R. H.  Dhebar  for	 therespondent.1956.  May 10.	The following Judgments were delivered.BHAGWATI  J.-Two questions were referred by  the  Income-taxAppellate Tribunal to the High Court of Bombay under section66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act.(1)  Whether there is any material to justify the assessmentof  Rs. 30,000 (Rupees thirty thousand) from out of the	 sumof Rs. 61,000 (Rupees sixtyone thousand) (for Income-tax andExcess	Profits	 Tax  and  Business  Profits  Tax  purposes)representing the value of high denomination notes which wereencashed on the eighteenth day of January one thousand	ninehundred and forty six, and(2)  Whether  in  any event by reason of the orders  of	 theRevenue	 Authorities not having found *at the  alleged	itemwas from alleged undisclosed business profits the assessmentof  Rs. 30,000 (Rupees thirty thousand) is in law  justifiedfor Excess Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax purposes?The   High  Court  answered  the  first	 question   in	 theaffirmative but refused to answer the second question, beingof the opinion that even though it had asked the Tribunal torefer that question under section 66 (2) of the Act, it	 hadno jurisdiction to do so inasmuch as the appellants had	 notasked the Tribunal to refer629the second question and, therefore, no question arose of theTribunal refusing to raise that question or to submit it forthe decision of the High Court.The appellants area partnership firm doing business in	MillStores at Ahmedabad.  Their head office is in Ahmedabad	 andtheir  branch office is in Bombay.  The Governor-General  on12th  January  1946 promulgated the High  Denomination	BankNotes (Demonetisation) Ordinance, 1946 and High DenominationBank  Notes ceased to be legal tender on the expiry of	12thday of January 1946.  Pursuant to clause 6 of the  Ordinancethe   appellants   on  18th  January  1946   encashed	highdenomination  notes of Rs. 1,000 each of the face  value  ofRs. 6-1,000.  This was done in the calendar year 1946  beingthe account year corresponding with assessment year 1947-48.During	the assessment proceedings for the year 1947-48	 theIncome-tax  Officer called upon the appellant to prove	fromwhom and when the said high denomination notes of Rs. 61,000were  received by the appellants and also the bona fides  ofthe previous owners thereof.  After examining the entries inthe  books of account of the appellants and the position  ofthe  Cash Balances on various dates from 20th December	1945to  18th  January  1946 and the nature	and  extent  of	 thereceipts  and  payments	 during	 the  relevant	period,	 theIncome-tax  Officer came to the conclusion that in order  tosustain	 the contention of the appellants he would  have  topresume	 that there were 18 high denomination notes  of	 Rs.1,000 each in the Cash Balance on 1st January 1946 and	thatall  cash  receipts after 1st January 1946 and	before	13thJanuary	 1946 were received in currency notes of  Rs.  1,000each, a presumption which he found impossible to make in theabsence	 of any evidence.  He, therefore, added the  sum  ofRs.  61,000 to the assessable income of the appellants	fromundisclosed sources.On  appeal  to	the  Appellate	Assistant  Commissioner	 theappellants  produced before him affidavits of three  personsto show that the appellants had received Rs. 20,000 in 1,000rupees currency notes on 28th			    630December 1945, Rs. 15,000 in 1,000 rupees currency notes  on6th  January  1946 and Rs. 8,500 in  1,000  rupees  currencynotes	(making	 Rs.  8,000)  on  8th  January	1946,	thusaggregating  to Rs. 43,500 during the relevant period.	 TheAppellate,   Assistant	Commissioner  did  not	accept	 thestatements  contained in the said affidavits  and  dismissedthe  appeal  and  confirmed  the  order	 of  the  Income-taxOfficer.An appeal was taken by the appellants before the  Income-taxAppellate   Tribunal.	The  Tribunal  after   taking	intoconsideration all the materials which bad been placed beforethe  Appellate	Assistant Commissioner, including  the	saidaffidavits, was of the opinion that if it was to accept	 theappellants' contention, it would mean that practically everypayment	 above Rs. 1,000 was received by the  appellants  inhigh  denomination notes, which was almost impossible.	 TheTribunal  could	 not  say that the appellants  bad  no	highdenomination  notes  with them.	 It accepted  the  books  ofaccount of the appellants but thought that the cash  balanceon   18th  January  1946  could	 not  have   sixtyone	highdenomination  notes.   It came to the  conclusion  that	 theappellants  appeared to have put in high denomination  notesin  the	 cash balance and taken the other  notes  away.	  Itaccepted  the appellants' explanation only in regard  to  31notes  and directed that the appellants' assessment for	 theyear under reference be reduced by that amount and dismissedthe rest of the appeal.The  appellants applied to the Tribunal for stating  a	caseand  referring the first question of law to the	 High  Courtfor  its  opinion  under section 66(1) of  the	Act.  -	 TheTribunal  rejected  the	 said application  holding  that  noquestion  of  law  arose from  its  order.   The  appellantsthereupon  applied to the High Court under section 66(2)  ofthe Act for an order directing the Tribunal to state a	caseand  refer  the questions set out in the  application.	 TheHigh  Court directed the Tribunal to state a case and  referthe  two questions of law set out hereinabove to it for	 itsdecision  under	 section 66(2) of the Act.  In	stating	 thecase and referring the said questions of law to the High631Court, the Tribunal pointed out that the second question wasnot urged before the Tribunal at any stage and hence it	 wasnot dealt with by it in its original order.The reference was heard by the High Court and the High Courtanswered the first referred question in the affirmative, butdid not answer the second referred question.  The High Courtheld  that there were materials before the Tribunal to	holdthat  the  sum of Rs. 30,000 represented the income  of	 theappellants from undisclosed sources and that the finding  ofthe Tribunal was a finding of fact based on materials beforeit  and even if it was an inference drawn by  the  Tribunal,the  inference was based on the facts and  materials  beforethe   Tribunal.	  The  High  Court  observed  that  it	 wasimpossible  to say that the inference drawn by the  Tribunalfrom  the circumstances was an unreasonable inference or  anarbitrary and capricious inference or an inference which  nojudicial tribunal could ever draw.  It, therefore,  answeredthe first referred question in the affirmative.As regards the second referred question, the High Court heldthat  question	was not raised by the  appellants  in  theirapplication  for  reference under section 66(1) of  the	 Actand,  therefore, it bad no jurisdiction to ask the  Tribunalto  state a case on a particular question of law, where	 theappellants themselves had never asked the Tribunal to  refersuch  a question to the High Court and that even  though  ithad  directed the Tribunal under section 66(2) to refer	 thesaid question, as it had no jurisdiction to ask the Tribunalto refer the said question, it was not open to it to  answerthe second question which had been raised by the Tribunal atits instance and refused to answer it.On a petition made by the appellants for leave to appeal  tothis  court, the High Court granted a certificate that	thiswas  a	fit  case for appeal to this court  and	 hence	thisappeal.It may be mentioned at the outset that the assessment of theappellants by the Income-tax Officer was under section 23(3)and section 26-A of the Act.  The632books  of  account of the appellants were  accepted  by	 theIncome-tax Officer and the only scrutiny made by the Income-tax Officer was whether at the relevant date,	  i.e.	  on12th January 1946, the appellants had in their	  cash	  61-notes of high denomination of Rs. 1,000 each.	  The	cashbook entries from 20th December 1945 up to 18th January 1946were  put in before the Income-tax Officer and	they  showedthat on 28th December 1945 Rs. 20,000 were received from theAnand  Textiles,  and there was an opening  balance  of	 Rs.18,395 on 2nd January 1946.  Rs. 15,000 were received by theappellants on 7th January 1946 from the Sushico Textiles andRs.  8,500  were received by them on 8th January  1946	fromManihen,  widow of Shah Maneklal Nihalchand.  Various  othersums  were also received by the appellants from 2nd  January1946 up to and inclusive of 1 1 th January 1946, which	wereeither	multiples  of Rs. 1,000 or were over Rs.  1,000	 andwere  thus capable of having been paid to the appellants  inhigh  denomination  notes of Rs. 1,000.	 There	was  a	cashbalance	 of  Rs.  69,891-2-6 with  the	appellants  on	12thJanuary	  1946,	 when  the  High  Denomination	Bank   Notes(Demonetisation)  Ordinance 1946 was promulgated and it	 wasthe  case  of  the appellants that they had  then  in  theircustody	 and  possession 61 high denomination notes  of	 Rs.13000, which they encashed through the Eastern Bank, on 18thJanuary	 1946.	 The appellants further	 sought	 to  supporttheir contention by procuring before the Appellate AssistantCommissioner  the  affidavits  of  Kuthpady  Shyama  Shetty,General Manager of Messrs Shree Anand Textiles, in regard topayment	 to the appellant is of a sum of Rs. 20,000  in	 Rs.1,000  currency	 notes on 28th December	 1945,	GovindprasadRamjivan Nivetia, proprietor of Messrs Shusiko Textiles,  inregard	to payment to the appellants of a sum of Rs.  15,000in  Rs.	 1,000 currency notes on 6th January  1946  and	 BaiManiben,  widow	 of Shah Maneklal Nihalchand, in  regard  topayment	 to the appellants of a sum of Rs. 8,500 (Rs.  8,000thereout  being in Rs. 1,000 currency notes) on 8th  January1946.  The appellants were not in a position to give further633particulars  of	 Rs. 1,000 currency notes received  by	themduring the relevant period, as they were not in the habit ofnoting	these particulars in their cash book -and  thereforerelied	upon  the position as it could be spelt out  of	 theentries in their cash book coupled with these affidavits  inorder  to show that on 12th January 1946 they had  in  theircash  balance  of Rs. 69,891-2-6, the 61  high	denominationcurrency  notes	 of Rs. 1,000 each, which they	encashed  on18th January 1946 through the Eastern Bank. Both  the  Income-tax Officer and the	Appellate  AssistantCommissioner  discounted this suggestion of -the  appellantsby holding that it was impossible that the appellants had onhand on 12th January 1946, the 61 high denomination currencynotes  of Rs. 1,000 each, included in their cash balance  ofRs. 69,891-2-6.	 The calculations., which they made involvedtaking into account all payments received by the  appellantsfrom and after 2nd January 1946, which were either multiplesof  Rs.	 1,000	or were over Rs. 1,000.	 There	was  a	cashbalance of Rs. 18,395-6-6 on band on 2nd January 1946, whichcould  have  accounted for 18 such  notes.   The  appellantsreceived thereafter as shown in their cash book several sumsof monies aggregating to over Rs. 45,000 in multiples of Rs.1,000  or  sums over Rs. 1,000, which could account  for  45other  notes  of that high denomination, thus making  up  63currency  notes	 of the high denomination of Rs.  1,000	 andthese  61  currency  notes  of Rs.  1,000  each,  which	 theappellants encashed on 18th January 1946 could as well	havebeen  in  their	 custody on 12th January  1946.	  This	was,however,  considered  impossible  by  both  the	  Income-taxOfficer	 and  the Appellate Assistant Commissioner  as	theycould not consider it within the bounds of possibility	thateach and every .payment received by the appellants after 2ndJanuary 1946 in multiples of Rs. 1,000 or over Rs. 1,000 wasreceived by the appellants in high denomination notes of Rs.1,000 each.' It was by reason of their visualisation of suchan   impossibility  that  they	negatived  the	 appellants'contention.It has to be noted, however, that beyond there82634calculations of figures, no further scrutiny was made by theIncome-tax  Officer or the Appellate Assistant	Commissionerof the entries in the cash book of the appellants.  The cashbook  of  the  appellants was  raccepted  and  the  entriestherein	 were  not  challenged.	  No  further  documents  orvouchers  in relation to those entries were called for,	 norwas  the presence of the deponents of the  three  affidavitsconsidered  necessary by either party.	The appellants	tookit  that  the affidavits of these parties  were	 enough	 andneither	 the  Appellate	 Assistant  Commissioner,  nor	 theIncometax  Officer,  who was present at the hearing  of	 theappeal	 before	  the  Appellate   Assistant   Commissioner,considered it necessary to call for them in order to  cross-examine	 them with reference to the statements made by	themin their a affidavits.	Under these circumstances it was notopen to the Revenue to challenge the correctness of the cashbook  entries or the statements made by those  deponents  intheir affidavits.This  being  the position, the state of affairs, as  it	 ob-tained	on  12th  January 1946, had got to  be	appreciated,having,	 regard to those entries in the cash books  and	 theaffidavits    filed   before   the    Appellate	   AssistantCommissioner, taking them at their face value.	The  entriesin the cash books disclosed that, taking the number of	highdenomination notes at 18 on 2nd January 1946, there came  inthe  custody  or  possession of	 the  appellants  after	 2ndJanuary	 1946 and up to 12th January 1946, 49 further  notesof  that  high	denomination, making 67 such  notes  in	 theaggregate,  out of which 61 such notes could be encashed  bythe  appellants	 on 18th January 1946  through	the  EasternBank.	A mere calculation of the nature indulged in by	 theIncome	tax Officer or the Appellate Assistant	Commissionerwas  not enough, without any further scrutiny,	to  dislodgethe  position  taken up by the appellants, supported  as  itwas, by the entries in the cash book and the affidavits	 putin   by	 the  appellants  before  the  Appellate   AssistantCommissioner.The Tribunal also fell into the same error.  It could635not  negative  the  possibility of the	appellant  being  inpossession  of	a  substantial number of  these	 high  deno-mination  currency notes.  It, however, considered  that  itwas impossible for the appellants to have bad 61 such  notesin the cash balance in their hands on 12th January 1946	 andthen it applied a rule of the thumb treating 31 out of	such61  notes as within the bounds of possibility, excluding  30such  notes  as	 not  covered  by  the	explanation  of	 theappellants.  This was pure surmise and had no basis in	-theevidence, which was on the record of the proceedings.The  High  Court treated this finding of the Tribunal  as  amere  finding of fact.	The position in regard to  all	suchfindings  of fact, as to whether they can be  questioned  inappeal,	 is thus laid down by the House of Lords in  Cameronv. Prendergast (Inspector of Taxes) (1):"Inferences  from  facts  stated by  the  Commissioners	 arematters	 of law and can be questioned on appeal.   The	sameremark is true as to the construction of documents.  If	 theCommissioners state the evidence and hold upon that evidencethat  certain  results follow, it is open to  the  Court  todiffer from such a holding".To  the	 same effect are the observations of  the  House  ofLords in Bomford v. Osborne (H.	 M. Inspector of Taxes) (2):"No  doubt  there  are many cases  in  which  Commissioners,having had proved or admitted before them a series of facts,may   deduce   therefrom  further  conclusions	 which	 arethemselves conclusions of pure fact.  But in such cases	 thedetermination  in point of law is that the facts  proved  oradmitted  provide  evidence to	support	 the  Commissioners'conclusions".	The  latest pronouncement of  the  House  ofLords on this question is to be found in Edwards  (Inspectorof  Taxes)  v. Bairstow and  Another(3).   Viscount  Simondsobserved at page 586:-"For it is universally conceded that, though it is(1) [1940]8I.T.R.(Suppl.)75,81.(2) [1942] 10 I.T.R. (Suppl.) 27, 34.(3) [1955] 28 I.T.R. 579.636a pure finding of fact, it may be set aside on grounds whichhave  been stated in various ways but are, I  think,  fairlysummarised by saying that the court should take that  courseif it appears that the Commissioners have acted without	 anyevidence  or  upon  a  view of the  facts  which  could	 notreasonably be entertained".and Lord Radcliffe expressed himself as under at page 592:-"If the case contains anything ex facie which is bad law andwhich  bears  upon  the	 determination,	 it  is,   obviouslyerroneous   in	point  of  law.	  But,	without	  any	suchmisconception  appearing ex facie, it may be that the  factsfound are such that no person acting judicially and properlyinstructed  as	to the relevant law could have come  to	 thedetermination  under appeal.  In those	circumstances,	too,the court must intervene".It  follows,  therefore, that facts proved or  admitted	 mayprovide	 evidence  to  support	further	 conclusions  to  bededuced	 from  them,  which conclusions	 may  themselves  beconclusions of fact and such inferences from facts proved oradmitted  could	 be  matters of law.   The  court  would  beentitled  to intervene if it appears that the  fact  findingauthority  has acted without any evidence or upon a view  ofthe facts, which could not reasonably be entertained or	 thefacts  found are such that no person acting  judicially	 andproperly  instructed as to the relevant law would have	cometo the determination in question.The  High Court recognised this position in effect but	wentwrong  in applying the true principles of interference	withsuch  findings	of fact to the present	case.	The  attemptwhich  was made by the High Court to probe into the mind  ofthe   Tribunal	by  trying  to	discard	 the  affidavit	  ofGovindprasad  Ramjivan Nivetia in regard to the	 payment  ofRs.  15,000  to the appellants in 15 currency notes  of	 Rs.1,000 each on 6th January 1946 and thus reducing the  aggre-gate  sum  of Rs. 43,500 to Rs. 28,500	and  justifying	 thefigure	of Rs. 31,000 arrived at by the Tribunal was  reallyfar-fetched and contrary to the terms of637the  tribunal' s order itself,the Tribunal not having  givenany  inkling, whatever, of what was at the back of its	mindwhen  it fixed upon the figure Rs. 31,000.  Really  speakingthe  Tribunal had not indicated upon what material  it	heldthat  Rs.  30,000  should be treated  as  secret  profit  orprofits from undisclosed sources and the order passed by  itwas   bad.   The  appellants  had  furnished  a	  reasonableexplanation  for  the possession of  the  high	denominationnotes  of  the	face value of Rs. 61,000 and  there  was  nojustification  for having accepted it in part and  discardedit  in	relation  to  a sum of Rs.  30,000.   The  case	 wasanalogous to the one before the Patna High Court in ChunilalTicamchand  Coal  Co. Ltd. v.  Commissioner  of	 Income-tax,Bihar  and Orissa(1) and should have been similarly  decidedin favour of the appellants.For the reasons indicated above, we are of the opinion	thatthe High Court was in error in answering the first  referredquestion  in the affirmative.  It ought to have answered  itin  the	 negative and held that there were no  materials  tojustify the assessment of Rs. 30,000 from out of the sum  ofRs.  61,000,  for  Income-tax and  Excess  Profits  Tax	 andBusiness  Profit Tax purposes representing the value of	 thehigh -denomination notes which were encashed on 18th January1946.In  view of the above it is not necessary for us to go	intothe  question whether the High Court ought to have  answeredthe second referred question also.  The answer to the  firstreferred question being in the' negative, the very basis forExcess	Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax disappears	 andthe second referred question becomes purely academical.The result, therefore, is that the appeal is allowed and thefirst  referred question is answered in the  negative.	 Theappellants will have their costs here as well as in the HighCourt.VIMNKATARAMA  AYYAR J.-I agree to the order  just  proposed;but I prefer to rest my decision on the(1)  [1955] 27 I.T.R. 602.638ground	 that  the  finding  of	 the  Tribunal	 that	highdenomination  notes of the value of Rs.	 30,000	 representedthe concealed* profits of the appellant is not supported  byany evidence, and is, in consequence, erroneous in point  oflaw and liable to be set aside.	 The evidence on record	 hasbeen  exhaustively reviewed in the judgment just  delivered,and there is no need to traverse the same ground again.	  Toput the matter in anut-shell, the accounts of the  appellanthave  been  accepted by the Tribunal as genuine, and  it  isimpossible  to	say, having regard to the  cash	 balance  asshown  therein,	 that the notes in question could  not	havebeen  included	therein.  The Tribunal observes that  it  isunlikely  that	so many high denomination notes	 would	havebeen  held  as	part of the cash on hand for  such  a  largenumber	of days.  That, no doubt, is highly suspicious;	 butthe decision of the Tribunal must rest not on suspicion	 buton  legal  testimony.  For the respondent,  Mr.	 Joshi	con.tended that the cash balance shown in the books could not beaccepted  as true, because the appellant had ample  time  torewrite	 the accounts, as the Ordinance was issued  on	12thJanuary 1946 and the year of account of the assessee was theCalendar year.	Whether the accounts are genuine or not is apure  question of fact, and a finding on a question of	factis as much binding on the Revenue as on the subject.639
