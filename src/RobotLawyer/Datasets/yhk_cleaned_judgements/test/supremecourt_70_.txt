Thereafter lie filed a Memo-randum of Appeal through a pleader which was rejected on theground that it was not maintainable owing to his appeal fromjail  under S. 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  havingbeen  dismissed	 earlier.  His review  petition	 before	 thejudicial Commissioner was also dismissed but his prayer	 forcertificate under Art. 132(1) was granted.The  question  was whether S. 421 of the  Code	of  CriminalProcedure  which enables a court to dismiss an appeal  filedby a convicted person, while he was in jail, without hearinghim offended against Art. 14 of the Constitution.Held,  that  the Code of Criminal Procedure  in	 giving	 theright  of appeal in Ch.	 XXXI based it on  a  classificationwhich was rational and reasonably connected with the  objectthe  Legislature had in view in enacting that chapter.	 Theposition of a convicted person in jail, and therefore unableto present an appeal either in person or through a  pleader,was entirely different and distinct from that of a convictedperson who was able to do so.  The Proviso to s. 421 of	 theCode  of  Criminal Procedure in no way offends	against	 theprovisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution.Held,  also, that a second appeal from the same judgment  ofconviction presented through a pleader was not	maintainablebecause the previous order dismissing the first appeal underS. 420 presented from jail was lawful and final under S. 430of the Code.JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION.  Criminal Appeal No. 106 of1956. Appeal	 from  the Judgment and Order dated the	 7th  April,1956, of the former Judicial Commissioner's65510Court, Vindhya Pradesh, Rewa in Misc.  Crl.  Application No.70 of 1956.A.   D. Mathur for the Appellant.B.   K. B. Naidu and I. N. Shroff for the Respondent.1960.  November 18.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyIMAM,  J.-The  Judicial	 Commissioner  of  Vindhya   Pradeshgranted a certificate under Art. 132(1) of the	Constitutionof  India as in his opinion the case involved a	 substantialquestion   of	law  as	 to  the   interpretation   of	 theConstitution.  Hence the present appeal.The appellant was convicted under s. 307, Indian Penal	Codeand s. 19(f) of the Indian Arms Act by the Sessions Judge ofChatarpur.    He  was  sentenced  to  10   years'   rigorousimprisonment under s. 307, Indian Penal Code and to 3 years'rigorous imprisonment under s. 19(f) of the Indian Arms Act.He filed an appeal while he was in jail which was  summarilydismissed  on  merits on October 28, 1955.   Thereafter,  onOctober 31, 1955, he filed a Memorandum of Appeal through  apleader	 which	was  rejected on November 1,  1955,  on	 theground that it was not maintainable owing to his appeal fromjail  under s. 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  havingbeen dismissed on October 28, 1955.Thereafter,   he  filed	 a  petition  before  the   JudicialCommissioner   that  the  order	 dated	October	 28,   1955,dismissing  his appeal from jail should be reviewed and	 hisappeal should be reheard on merits.  This petition was	alsodismissed  by the Judicial Commissioner.  The appellant	 hadprayed	for a certificate under Arts. 132 and 134(c) of	 theConstitution.  The Judicial Commissioner was of the  opinionthat  no  ground  had  been  established  for  grant  of   acertificate under Art. 134(c) but a certificate should issueunder Art. 132(1).The  only  question  for determination	in  this  appeal  iswhether the case involves any substantial question of law asto the interpretation of the Constitution.  It511had been urged before the Judicial Commissioner that s.	 421of  the Code of Criminal Procedure which enabled a court  todismiss an appeal filed by a convicted person, while he	 wasin jail, without hearing him offended against Art. 14 of theConstitution as it discriminated between him and a convictedperson who presented his appeal either in person or  througha pleader.Before	we  consider  whether s. 421  of  the  Code  offendsagainst the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution it  isdesirable  to  set out shortly the scheme of  appeals  underChapter	 XXXI of the Code of Criminal Procedure	 before	 itsamendment  which  came	into force  in	1956.	Section	 404expressly states that no appeal shall lie from any  judgmentor  order of a criminal court except as provided for by	 theCode or by any other law for the time being in force.	Thisprovision  is in accordance with the general principle	thatno  appeal  lies as a matter of right unless  the  right  ofappeal is conferred by law.  There are various provisions inChapter XXXI providing for an appeal from various orders andsentences  passed  by  the  Criminal  courts.	Section	 410enables	 any person convicted at a trial held by a  SessionsJudge or an Additional Sessions Judge to appeal to the	HighCourt.	The Court of Judicial Commissioner, Vindhya Pradesh,was  a High Court for the purposes of the Code.	 The  appealof  the	 appellant  from jail  against	his  conviction	 andsentence by the Sessions Judge therefore lay to the Court ofthe  Judicial Commissioner.  Under s. 418 an appeal may	 lieon a matter of fact as well as a matter of law, except wherethe  trial was by jury, in which case, the appeal would	 lieonly on a matter of law, except in a case where a person hadbeen sentenced to death, his appeal would lie on a matter offact  as well as a matter of law although he was tried by  ajury.	The section also enables any other person  convictedat the same trial with a person so sentenced to appeal on  amatter	of  fact as well as a matter of	 law.	Section	 419enjoins	 that  every appeal shall be made in the form  of  apetition  in  writing  presented by  the  appellant  or	 hispleader and every such512petition  shall, unless the court to which it  is  presentedotherwise directs, be accompanied by a copy of the  judgmentor order appealed against and in cases tried by jury a	copyof  the heads of the charge recorded under S. 367.   Section420 enables a person who is in jail to present his  petitionof  appeal  and	 the copies accompanying  the  same  to	 theOfficer-In-charge  of the jail who shall  thereupon  forwardsuch petition or copy to the proper Appellate Court.   Unders. 421 on receiving the petition and copy under s. 419 or s.420  the  Appellate Court shall peruse the same	 and  if  itconsiders   that  there	 are  no  sufficient   grounds	 forinterfering, it may dismiss the appeal summarily.  There  isa  proviso  to	this section which  states  that  no  appealpresented  under  s.  419  shall  be  dismissed	 unless	 theappellant or his pleader has had a reasonable opportunity ofbeing heard in support of the same.  The only other  sectionfor  the purpose of this appeal, to which reference need  bemade,  is  s.  430 which states that  judgments	 and  orderspassed	by  an Appellate Court upon appeal shall  be  final,except	in  the	 cases provided for in s.  417	and  ChapterXXXII.It  will  be seen from these provisions of the Code  that  aconvicted  person, in cases where an appeal is provided	 forby  the	 Code,	may file a petition  of	 appeal	 in  writingpresented by him or his pleader and that if he is in jail hemay file his petition of appeal through the jail authoritieswho  are  obliged to forward the petition to  the  AppellateCourt concerned.  Whether an appeal is filed under s. 419 orunder  s.  420	of the Code, the Appellate  Court  has	beenexpressly authorized, after perusing the petition of  appealand copies of the judgment or charge to the jury, if it con-siders that there is no sufficient ground for  interference,to  dismiss the appeal summarily.  In the present case,	 theappellant  was	in  jail and he presented  his	petition  ofappeal	to the Court of the Judicial Commissioner  under  s.420   through  the  jail  authorities.	 It  was   summarilydismissed on merits on October 28, 1955.  If that order	 waslawfully made the decision of the Appellate Court was  finalunder  s.  430	of  the	 Code.	 Consequently,	the   appealpresented by513the  appellant through his pleader on October 31, 1955,	 waspatently not maintainable.We  come now to the question whether s. 421 offends  againstthe  provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution which  statesthat  the  State  shall not deny to 1  any  person  equalitybefore	the law or the equal protection of the	laws  withinthe  territory	of India.  This Court has  decided  in	manycases  what  are the matters to be considered  in  order  todetermine  whether  a  particular piece	 of  legislation  isdiscriminatory	and  consequently in  contravention  of	 theprovisions of Art. 14.	It is unnecessary to refer to  them.The object of Chapter XXXI of the Code of Criminal Procedurewas  to	 make provisions for appeals against  conviction  incertain cases.	Where no appeal is provided by this  Chapterno further question arises because no one can claim that  hehas a right to appeal from any decision of a criminal court.Every  person convicted at a trial held by a Sessions  Judgeor an Additional Sessions Judge has been given the right  toappeal	to the High Court by virtue of the provisions of  s.410  of the Code.  The right to appeal having been so  giventhe Code provided the manner in which such appeal should  bepresented  which  is to be found in ss. 419 and 420  of	 theCode.  These two sections contemplate various  possibilities(1) that a convicted person who is not in jail presents	 hispetition  of appeal in person; (2) that a  convicted  personthough	unable to present his petition of appeal  personallyowing  to various reasons, including his being in jail,	 canpresent	 it through his pleader and (3) where the  convictedperson is in jail and thus unable to present his petition inperson	and  is unable to engage a pleader to  present	his,petition  of  appeal,  can  present  it	 through  the	jailauthorities.  Where the convicted person presents his appealin person or through a pleader under s. 421 his appeal shallnot be dismissed summarily unless he or his pleader is givena  reasonable opportunity of being heard in support  of	 hispetition.   No	such consideration arises in the case  of  aconvicted  person who is unable to present his	petition  inperson or through a pleader.  There is a rational basis for514making	the  classification  mentioned	above  which  has  areasonable  connection	with the object of  the	 legislationproviding  for	appeals under Chapter XXXI.   Under  s.	 410there  is  no discrimination as any person  convicted  at  atrial  held  by a Sessions Judge or an	Additional  SessionsJudge  may  appeal to the High Court.  Where  the  convictedperson	is able to present his petition of appeal in  personhis  position  is entirely different from a  person  who  isunable	to  do	so  because he is  in  jail.   Similarly,  aconvicted person whether in jail or not who can present	 hispetition through a pleader is in a different position from aconvicted person who is in jail and is unable to present hispetition  through a pleader.  The Code intended in the	caseof  a convicted person who presents his petition  of  appealwhile  in  jail that his petition and the  judgment  of	 thecourt  which  convicted	 him  must  be	considered  by	 theAppellate Court before it is summarily dismissed,  otherwisethe right of appeal conferred on such a person under s.	 410would  be  meaningless.	  In the case of such  a  person  noquestion could arise of his being heard in person because hehas  not presented the appeal in person nor could  there  beany  question of his pleader being heard because no  pleaderhad  been engaged by him to present the	 appeal.   Differentconsiderations	arise in the case of a convicted person	 whopresents  his  petition	 of appeal in person  or  through  apleader in which case he or his pleader must be heard beforethe  appeal is summarily dismissed.  There is, therefore,  arational  basis	 for making the	 classification	 into  threecategories which has a reasonable connection with the objectof  the	 Code.	 It could not therefore	 be  said  that	 theproviso to s' 421 offends against the provisions of Art.  14of the Constitution.It  was,  however, contended that although an  appeal  filedunder s. 420 may have been dismissed summarily a  subsequentappeal filed through a pleader ought to have been heard	 andthe  Judicial Commissioner erred in holding that the  appealdid  not  lie.	 The appeal could not  have  been  summarilyrejected without the pleader having been515heard.	From that point of view the provisions of s. 421 hadnot been complied with.	 It is sufficient to say that if theorder  dated  October 28, 1955, dismissing  the	 appellant'sappeal	under  s. 420 was lawful, a second appeal  from	 thesame judgment of conviction presented through a pleader	 wasnot  maintainable  because the previous order  of  the	HighCourt  dismissing the appeal was final under s. 430  of	 theCode of Criminal Procedure.  Certain cases were relied	uponto   which   reference	has  been  made	 by   the   JudicialCommissioner.	Those  cases can be distinguished  from	 thepresent case.  In none of them was it decided that where  anorder  dismissing the appeal is lawful a  subsequent  appealfiled  through a pleader was maintainable.  In our  opinion,there  is no substance in this point, once it is  held	thatthe order dated October 28, 1955, was a lawful order  which,we think, it was, as in our opinion the proviso to s. 421 inno  way	 offends against the provisions of Art.	 14  of	 theConstitution.  The appeal is accordingly dismissed.					 Appeal dismissed.	       ----------------------------
