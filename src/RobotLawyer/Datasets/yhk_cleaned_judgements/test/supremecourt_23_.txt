The Sessions judge on appeal  upheldthe conviction and sentence under S. 409 of the Indian PenalCode, but set aside the conviction and sentence under s. 105of the Insurance Act on the ground that no sanction under s.107  of the Insurance Act had been obtained.   Sanction	 wasthereafter obtained and a fresh complaint was filed  againstthe  respondents  under s. 105 of the  Insurance  Act.	 Thetrial ended in an acquittal by the Magistrate who held	thatArt. 20(2) Of the Constitution and also s. 26 of the GeneralClauses Act were a bar to conviction.  The State appealed tothe High Court against the108order of acquittal but the appeal was dismissed.  On furtherappeal by the State,Held,  that the crucial requirement to attract Art. 202)  Ofthe  Constitution  is  that  the  two  offences	 should	  beidentical.  it	is,  therefore,	 necessary  to	analyse	 andcompare	 the  ingredients of the two offences, and  not	 theallegations made in the two complaints, to see whether theiridentity is established.So  judged,  there  can be no doubt that  in  spite  of	 thepresence of    certain common elements between the two,	 theoffences under S.   409 of the Indian Penal Code and S., 105of  the	 Insurance Act	are distinct in	 their	ingredients,content and scope and cannot be said to be identical.Om  Prakash Gupta v. State of U. P., [1957] S.C.R.  423	 andState  of  Madhya   Pradesh v. Veereshw	 ar  Rao  Agnihotry,[1957] S.C.R. 868, referred to.A  similar  view  of the scope of the  rule  as	 to  double-jeopardy has always been taken by the American Courts.Albrecht  v. United States, (1927) 273 U. S. 1: 71  Law	 Ed.505, referred to.In S. 26 of the General Clauses Act also the emphasis is noton  the	 facts	alleged in the two  complaints	but  on	 theingredients of the two offences charged.This  construction of Art. 20(2) of the Constitution and  S.26  of the General Clauses Act, 1897, is precisely  in	linewith s. 403(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.Consequently,  it  could not be said, in the  instant  case,that  the respondents were being sought to be  punished	 forthe  same offence so as to attract either Art. 20(2) Of	 theConstitution or S.  26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION:    Criminal Appeal No.  63of 1957.Appeal	from the judgment and order dated March 2, 1956,  ofthe Bombay High Court in Cr.  A. No. 1258 of 1955.H.   R. Khanna and R. H. Dhebar, for the appellant.N.   S. Bindra, for the respondents (Amicus curiae).1960.	December 9. The following Judgment of the Court	 wasdelivered byAYYANGAR, J.-This appeal on a certificate under Art.  134(1)of  the	 Constitution granted by the High Court	 of  Bombay,principally  raises  for consideration the  application	 andscope  of  Art. 20(2) of the Constitution and  s.26  of	 theGeneral Clauses Act.109 The  facts  necessary for the appreciation  of	 the  pointsinvolved  in this appeal are few and may be briefly  stated.The two respondents-S.	L. Apte and Miss Dwarkabai Bhat-wererespectively   the  Managing  Director,	 and  the   ManagingDirector of the Women's department, of an insurance  Companyby  name  'The Long Life Insurance Company'  which  had	 itsheadquarters  at  Poona.   A  power  of	 attorney  had	beenexecuted by the company in favour of the first respondent inJune,  1942,  under  which he was  vested  with	 the  power,control and possession inter alia of the moneys belonging tothe  company  with a view to have them	invested  in  propersecurities.  The second respondent as Manaaing Director alsoacted  under  another  power of	 attorney  executed  by	 thecompany in her favour in or about June, 1942, and by  virtuethereof	 she  was assisting the first  respondent  in  main-taining the accounts of the company.  While the	 respondentswere thus functioning, an audit conducted in 1952  disclosedthat considerable sums of money amounting to over Rs. 55,000were  shown  as	 cash balances with  the  first	 respondent.Further	 enquiries made by the Directors showed that  moneysaggregating  to over Rs. 95,000 had from time to  time	beenwithdrawn from the company by the first respondent with	 theassistance   and   sanction  of	  the	second	 respondent,professedly  for  the expenses of the  company.	  Among	 thepapers	of the company was a voucher dated August  9,  1952,evidencing  the	 withdrawal  of this  amount  by  the  firstrespondent  and	 signed	 by  him  and  this  also  bore	 thesignature of the second respondent in token of her sanction.The respondents, however, could furnish no proper account ofthe legitimate expenses of the company for which the  amountwas purported to be taken.Both  the  respondents	were  thereupon	 prosecuted  for  anoffence	 under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code and also	 foran  offence  under  s. 105 of the Indian  Insurance  Act  inCriminal Case 82 of 1953.  The learned Magistrate  convictedand  sentenced	both the respondents for both  the  offenceswith  which  they were charged.	 The  respondents  thereuponfiled110appeals	 to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Poona  and	 thelearned	 Sessions  Judge, by his order dated  May  3,  1954,while	confirming  the	 conviction  and  sentence  on	 therespondents under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code set  asidetheir  conviction under s. 105 of the Indian Insurance	Act.The  reason  for  the latter order was the  finding  of	 thelearned Sessions Judge that the sanction required by s.	 107of the Indian Insurance Act which was a prerequisite for theinitiation  of	the prosecution under s. 105  had  not	beenobtained  before the complaint in respect thereof  had	beedfiled.	 The  conviction and sentence under s.	409  of	 theIndian	Penal Code which had been affirmed by  the  SessionsJudge in both the cases have now become final.Subsequetly  the Insurance Company obtained the sanction  ofthe  Advocate-General of Bombay under s. 107 of	 the  IndianInsurance  Act	and filed a complaint in the  Court  of	 theJudicial Magistrate, Poona, on January 18, 1955, against thetwo respondents charging each of them with an offence  unders. 105 of the Indian Insurance Act.  The Magistrate took thecase  on file and directed the issue of process.   Thereuponthe   two  respondents	made  an  application	before	 theMagistrate  on	March 22, 1955, praying that  the  complaintagainst	 them may be dismissed as being barred by s.  403(1)of the Criminal Procedure Code, by reason of their  previousconviction by the Magistrate for the same offence under	 theInsurance Act and their acquittal in respect thereof by	 theSessions   Judge,  pleading  in	 addition  that	  when	 theconviction by the Magistrate stood, they had even  undergonea  portion of the sentence imposed.  The learned  Magistrateoverruled this plea on the ground that the acquittal of	 therespondents was not on the merits of the case, but for	lackof  sanction under s. 107 of the Indian Insurance Act  whichrendered  the Magistrate without jurisdiction  to  entertainthe  complaint.	  The  trial was  then	proceeded  with	 andevidence was led.  But finally the Magistrate acquitted	 therespondents   on   the	ground	that  Art.  20(2)   of	 theConstitution and s. 26 of the General Clauses Act were a barto their111conviction  and punishment.  The State of  Bombay  thereuponfiled  an  appeal  to the High Court under  s.	417  of	 theCriminal  Procedure Code.  The appeal was dismissed  by	 thelearned	 Judges	 who however granted a	certificate  on	 thestrength of which this appeal has been preferred.As the prosecution against the respondents under s.    105of the Insurance Act has been held to be barred by     reasonof   the   provisions  contained  in  Art.  20(2)   of	 theConstitution and s. 26 of the General Clauses Act, it  wouldbe convenient to set out these provisions before entering ona discussion of their content and scope.Article 20(2) of the Constitution runs:	      "No  person shall be prosecuted  and  punished	      for the same offence more than once."	      Section 26 of the General Clauses Act enacts:	      "Where  an  act  or  omission  constitutes  an	      offence under two or more enactments, then the	      offender shall be liable to be prosecuted	 and	      punished	 under	either	or  any	  of   those	      enactments,  but	shall not be  liable  to  be	      punished twice for the same offence."As  the application of these two  provisions is	 conditionedby  the identity of the two offences which form the  subjectof  the	 prosecution  or  prosecutions,	 we  might  as	wellreproduce  the	relevant  provisions  constituting  the	 twooffences,  viz., s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code and s.	 105of the Indian Insurance Act:	      "409.  Whoever, being in any manner  entrusted	      with  property,  or  with	 any  dominion	over	      property	in his capacity of a public  servant	      or  in  the way of his business as  a  banker,	      merchant,	 factor, broker, attorney or  agent,	      commits criminal breach of trust in respect of	      that   property,	 shall	be   punished	with	      imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of	      either description for a term which may extend	      to  ten  years, and shall also  be  liable  to	      fine."Criminal  breach  of  trust referred to in  the	 section  isdefined in s. 405 of the Indian Penal Code in these terms:	      "405.  Whoever, being in any manner entrusted	      112	      with  property,  or  with	 any  dominion	over	      property,	  dishonestly	misappropriates	  or	      converts	to  his own use	 that  property,  or	      dishonestly uses or disposes of that  property	      in   violation   of  any	direction   of	 law	      prescribing the mode in which such trust is to	      be  discharged.  or  of  any  legal  contract,	      express or implied, which he has made touching	      the  discharge  of  such	trust,	or  wilfully	      suffers  any  other person so to	do,  commits	      'criminal breach of trust'."The  offence  created  by the Indian  Insurance	 Act  is  asfollows:	      "105.   (1)'Any  director,   managing   agent,	      manager  or  other officer or employee  of  an	      insurer  who wrongfully obtains possession  of	      any property of the insurer or having any such	      property	 in   his   possession	  wrongfully	      withholds	  it  or  wilfully  applies  it	  to	      purposes	 other	than  those   expressed	  or	      authorised by this Act shall on the  complaint	      of  the  Controller  made	 after	giving	 the	      insurer not less than fifteen days' notice  of	      his  intention,  or, on the complaint  of	 the	      insurer  or  any member or  any  policy-holder	      thereof,	be  punishable with fine  which	 may	      extend  to  one  thousand rupees	and  may  be	      ordered  by  the Court trying the	 offence  to	      deliver up or refund within a time to be fixed	      by  the  Court any  such		    property	      improperly obtained or wrong- fully   withheld	      or  wilfully  misapplied	and  in	 default  to	      Buffer imprisonment for a period not exceeding	      two years.	      (2)This section shall apply in respect of a	      provident society as defined in Part III as it	      applied in respect of an insurer."Before addressing ourselves to the arguments urged before asby  the	 Yearned  Counsel  for the  appellant  State  it  isnecessary to set out one matter merely to put it aside.	 Theentire argument on behalf of the State before the High Courtproceeded  on  denying that the order of  a  Criminal  Courtpassed	under s. 105 of the Indian Insurance  Act  directingthe accused to "deliver up or refund...... any such propertyimproperly  withheld or wilfully misapplied" was a  "punish-ment" within either Art. 20(2) of the Constitution or113s. 26 of the General Clauses Act.  The learned Judges of theHigh Court rejected this contention.  Though learned Counselfor   the  appellant  originally  submitted  that   he	 wascontesting  this conclusion of the High, Court, he  did	 notaddress	 us  any  argument under that head  and	 we  do	 nottherefore  find	 it  necessary to dwell on  this  point	 anyfurther, but shall proceed on the basis that a direction  bythe  Magistrate to replace the moneys of the insurer with  apenalty	 of imprisonment in default of compliance  therewithwas a "punishment" within Art. 20(2) of the Constitution ands. 26 of the General Clauses Act.Turning	 to the main points urged before us, we may  premisethe discussion by stating that it was not disputed before usby  learned  Counsel for the State, as it was  not  disputedbefore	the  learned  Judges of the  High  Court,  that	 theallegations  to	 be  found  in	the  original  complaint  inCriminal  Case 82 of 1953 on which the conviction  under  s.409  of the Indian Penal Code was obtained were	 similar  tothe allegations to be found in the complaint under s. 105 ofthe Indian Insurance Act.  It should, however, be  mentionedthat there was not any complete identity in the statement offacts  which set out the acts and omissions on the  part  ofthe  respondents  which were alleged to constitute  the	 twooffences-s.  409 of the Indian Penal Code and s. 105 of	 theInsurance  Act.	  For instance, in the complaint  which	 hasgiven rise to this appeal, the crucial paragraphs  detailingthe allegations are 12 and 13 of the complaint which run:	      "12.  The company submits that the accused has	      thus  wrongfully	obtained possession  of	 Rs.	      95,000   or  having  that	 property   in	 his	      possession wrongfully withheld it or  wilfully	      applied  it  to  purposes	 other	than   those	      expressed or authorised by the	  Insurance	      Act, 1938, and committed an offence on   the	      9th August, 1952, under Sectionof the  Insurance	      Act, 1938."	      "13. The company through their Solicitorscalled	      upon  the	 accused  to  explain  his   conduct	      within7	      15	      114	      days  from  the receipt of  the  letter.	 The	      accused  has failed and neglected to reply  to	      the said letters."It is obvious that on these allegations alone the offence ofcriminal  breach of trust could not be established  as	theylack  any reference to any entrustment or to  the  dishonestintent	which  are the main ingredients of  the	 offence  ofcriminal  breach  of  trust.  But to this  point  about	 thedifference  in the ingredients of the two offences we  shallrevert a little later.Even  assuming that the allegations to be found in  the	 twocomplaints  were identical, the question,  however,  remainswhether	 to attract the ban imposed by either Art. 20(2)  ofthe Constitution or s. 26 of the General ClausesAct  on	 asecond punishment, it is  sufficient that the allegations inthe two complaints are substantiallythe same or	 whetherit is necessary further that theingredients	    whichconstitute the two offences should be identical.We shall first take\ up for consideration Art. 20(2) of	 theConstitution whose terms we shall repeat:	      "20.  (2)	 No person shall be  prosecuted	 and	      punished for the same offence more than once."To  operate  as	 a  bar	 the  second  prosecution  and	 theconsequential  punishment thereunder, must be for "the	sameoffence".  The crucial requirement therefore for  attractingthe  Article is that the offences are the same,	 i.e.,	theyshould	be  identical.	If, however, the  two  offences	 aredistinct, then notwithstanding that the allegations of factsin  the two complaints might be substantially  similar,	 thebenefit	 of  the ban cannot be invoked.	 It  is,  therefore,necessary to analyse and compare not the allegations in	 thetwo  complaints but the ingredients of the two offences	 andsee  whether their identity is made out.  It would  be	seenfrom a comparison of s. 105 of the Insurance Act and a.	 405of Indian Penal Code (a. 409 of the Indian Penal Code  beingonly  an  aggravated form of the same offence)	that  thoughsome of the necessary ingredients are common they differ  inthe following:(1)Whereas  under  a.  405 of the Indian  Penal	 Code  theaccused must be "entrusted" with property or with  "dominionover that property", under s. 105 of115the Insurance Act the entrustment or dominion over  propertyis  unnecessary it is sufficient if the	 manager,  director,etc.  "obtains possession" of the property.(2)The offence of criminal breach of trust (s. 405 of  theIndian	Penal  Code)  is not committed	unless	the  act  ofmisappropriation  or  conversion  or  "the  disposition	  inviolation of the law or contract", is done with a  dishonestintention,  but	 s. 105 of the Insurance Act  postulates  nointention and punishes as an offence the mere withholding ofthe  property-whatever be the intent with which the same  isdone,  and  the	 act of application of the  property  of  aninsurer	 to purposes other than those authorised by the	 Actis similarly without reference to any intent with which suchapplication   or   misapplication   is	 made.	  In   thesecircumstances  it  does not seem possible to  say  that	 theoffence	 of criminal breach of trust under the Indian  PenalCode  is the "same offence" for which the  respondents	wereprosecuted  on	the complaint of the company  charging	themwith an offence under s. 105 of the Insurance Act.This  aspect of the matter based on the two  offences  beingdistinct  in  their ingredients, content and scope  was	 notpresented to the learned Judges of the High Court,  possiblybecause	  the  decisions  of  this  Court   construing	 andexplaining the scope of Art. 20(2) were rendered later.	  InOm  Prakash Gupta v. State of U.P. (1) the accused, a  clerkof a municipality had been convicted of an offence under  s.409 of the Indian Penal Code for having misappropriated sumsof money received by him in his capacity as a servant of thelocal  authority  and the conviction had  been	affirmed  onappeal,	 by the Sessions Judge and in revision by  the	HighCourt.	 The plea raised by the accused before this  Court,in  which the matter was brought by an appeal  with  specialleave,	was  that s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code  had	beenrepealed by implication by the enactment of sub-ss. (1)	 (c)and (2) of s. 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act  becausethe  latter dealt with an offence of substantially the	sametype.  This Court repelled that contention.  It(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 423.116analysed  the  ingredients  of the two	offences  and  afterpointing  out the difference in the crucial  elements  whichconstituted the offences under the two provisions, held thatthere  was  no repeal of s. 409 of the	'Indian	 Penal	Codeimplied by the constitution of a new offence under the termsof the Prevention of Corruption Act.  It was the applicationof this decision and the ratio underlying it in the  contextof  Art. 20(2) ,of the Constitution that is of relevance  tothe present appeal.  The occasion for this arose in State ofMadhya	Pradesh v. Veereshwar Rao Agnihotry (1).   The	res-pondent	 was  a tax-collector under a municipality  and	 wasprosecuted  for	 offences among others under s. 409  of	 theIndian Penal Code and s 5(2) of the Prevention of CorruptionAct  for misappropriation of sums 'entrusted to him as	suchtax-collector.	By virtue of the provision contained in s. 7of  the Criminal Law Amendment Act, XLVI of 1952,  the	casewas transferred to a Special Judge who was appointed by	 theState Government after the prosecution was commenced  beforea Magistrate.  The Special Judge found the accused guilty ofthe  offence  under  s. 409 of the  Indian  Penal  Code	 andconvicted  him to three years' rigorous imprisonment but  asregards	 the  charge  under S. 5(2)  of	 the  Prevention  ofCorruption  Act, he acquitted the accused on the  ground  ofcertain	 procedural  non-compliance  with the  rules  as  toinvestigation  prescribed  by  the  latter  enactment.	 Therespondent   appealed  to  the	High  Court   against	thisconviction  and	 sentence under s. 409 of the  Indian  PenalCode and there urged that by reason of his acquittal in res-pect  of  the  offence under s. 5(2) of	 the  Prevention  ofCorruption  Act, his conviction under s. 409 of the  Indian,Penal  Code  could not also be maintained,  the	 same  beingbarred by Art. 20(2) of the Constitution.  The High Court ofMadhya Bharat accepted this argument and allowed the  appealand the State challenged the correctness of this decision byan appeal to this Court.  Allowing the appeal of the  State,Govinda	 Menon,	 J., delivering the judgment  of  the  Courtobserved:(1)[1957] S.C.R. 868:117	      "This  Court has recently held in	 Om  Prakash	      Gupta v. The State of U.P. that the offence of	      criminal	misconduct punishable under s.	5(2)	      of  the  Prevention of Corruption Act,  11  of	      1947, is not identical in essence, import	 and	      content  with an offence under s. 409  of	 the	      Indian  Penal  Code   In	view  of  the  above	      pronouncement,  the view taken by the  learned	      Judge of the, High Court that the two offences	      are one and the same, is wrong, and if that is	      so,  there can be no objection to a trial	 and	      conviction  under s. 409 of the  Indian  Penal	      Code,   even  if	the  respondent	  has	been	      acquitted	 of an offence under s. 5(2) of	 the	      Prevention of Corruption Act, II of 1947	 The	      High  Court  also	 relied on Art.	 20  of	 the	      Constitution  for the order of  acquittal	 but	      that  Article  cannot apply because  the	res-	      pondent  was  not	 prosecuted  after  he	 had	      already been tried and acquitted for the	same	      offence  in an earlier trial  and,  therefore,	      the  well-known maxim "Nemo debet bis  vexari,	      si  constat curiae quod sit pro una  et  eadem	      causa" (No man shall be twice punished, if  it	      appears  to the court that it is for  one	 and	      the  same	 cause) embodied in Art.  20  cannot	      apply" Before	 leaving this part of the case we might	 also  pointout  that  a  similar view of the scope of the	rule  as  todouble-jeopardy	 has  always  been taken by  the  Courts  inAmerica.  The words of the Vth Amendment where this rule  isto be found in the American Constitution are:	      "Nor shall any person be subject, for the same	      offence,	to be twice put in jeopardy of	life	      or limb." and it will be noticed that there as	      well,   the  ban	is  confined  to  a   second	      prosecution   and	 punishment  for  the	same	      offence.	 Willoughby after referring  to	 the	      words  quoted  in the  Fifth  Amendment  says:			    "Cases  may	 occur in which the  same  act	may	      render  the  actor  guilty  of  two   distinct	      offences;	 In  such cases the  accused  cannot	      plead   the  trial  and  acquittal,   or	 the	      conviction  and punishment for one offence  in	      bar  to  a conviction for the  other"(1).	  In	      Albrecht v.	      (1)Constitution	of  the	 United	  States,	      Vol.II.- p. 1158.,	      118	      United States (1) Brandeis, J., speaking for a	      unanimous Court said:	      "There  is  a claim of violation	of  the	 Vth	      Amendment	  by   the  imposition	 of   double	      punishment.   This contention rests  upon	 the	      following	 facts.	 Of the nine, counts in	 the	      information four charged illegal possession of	      liquor, four illegal sale and one	 maintaining	      a	 common	 nuisance.  The contention  is	that	      there was double punishment because the liquor	      which the defendants were convicted for having	      sold is the same that they were convicted	 for	      having possessed.	 But possessing and  selling	      are  distinct  offences.	 One  may  obviously	      possess without selling; and one may sell	 and	      cause to be delivered a thing of which he	 has	      never   had  possession;	or  one	  may	have	      possession and later sell, as appears to	have	      been  done  in this case.	 The fact  that	 the	      person  sells  the liquor which  he  possessed	      does  not render the possession and  the	sale	      necessarily   a  single  offence.	  There	  is	      nothing  in  the Constitution  which  prevents	      Congress	from punishing separately each	step	      leading  to the consummation of a	 transaction	      which  it has power to prohibit and  punishing	      also the completed transaction."If,  therefore,	 the  offences were  distinct  there  is  noquestion  of the rule as to double-jeopardy as	embodied  inArt. 20(2) of the Constitution being applicable.The  next point to be considered is as regards the scope  ofs.  26	of  the General Clauses Act.  Though s.	 26  in	 itsopening words refers to "the act or omission constituting anoffence	 under two or more enactments", the emphasis is	 noton the facts alleged in the two complaints but rather on theingredients  which constitute the two offences with which  aperson	is  charged.  This is made clear by  the  concludingportion of the section which refers to "shall not be  liableto  be	punished  twice	 for the  same	offence,".   If	 theoffences are not the same but are distinct, the ban  imposedby  this  provision also cannot be  invoked.   It  thereforefollows that in the present case as the respondents are	 notbeing sought to be punished for "the(1)  (1927) 273 TT.S. I: 71 Law.  Ed. 505.			    119same  offence"	twice  but for two  distinct  offences	con-stituted or made up of different ingredients the bar of	 theprovision is inapplicable.In  passing, it may be pointed out that the construction  wehave  placed on Art. 20(2) of the Constitution and s. 26  ofthe General Clauses Act is precisely in line with the  termsof s. 403(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code which runs:	      "403.  (2) A person acquitted or convicted  of	      any  offence may be afterwards tried  for	 any	      distinct	offence for which a separate  charge	      might have been made against him on the former	      trial under section 235, sub-section (1)."It  would  be noticed that it is because of  this  provisionthat  the  respondents	before us  were	 originally  chargedbefore	the  Magistrate	 in Criminal Case 82  of  1953	withoffences under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code as well as s.105 of the Indian Insurance Act.The  respondents in this case did not appear in	 this  Courtand as the appeal had to be heard ex parte Mr. N. S.  Bindrawas requested to appear as amicus curiae to assist the Courtat the hearing of the appeal.  We express our thanks to	 himfor the assistance he rendered.The  appeal is accordingly allowed and the judgment and	 theorder  of the High Court is set aside and the case  will  goback  to the Judicial Magistrate, Fourth Court,	 Poona,	 forbeing proceeded with according to law.Appeal allowed.Case remanded.120
