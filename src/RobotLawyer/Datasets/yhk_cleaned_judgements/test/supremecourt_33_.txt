On the promulgation of the Constitution  of  India,the United State of Rajasthan became the State of  Rajasthanin  the	 Indian	 Union and all	its  assets,  including	 thejhalawar  State	 Bank and its dues, vested in the  State  ofRajasthan.Moneys	due from the appellants in respect of advances	madeto  them  by  the  jhalawar State Bank at  a  time  when  itbelonged to the ruling State of jhalawar, could be recoveredby  the State of Rajasthan after the Bank had become  vestedin it, as a public demand under the Rajasthan Public DemandsRecovery Act, 1952.The form prescribed in the Rajasthan Public Demands RecoveryAct,  in  which a certificate has to be drawn up  and  filedunder  S.  4  of  the Act  for	commencing  proceedings	 forrecovery  of  public demands under the Act in so far  as  itrequired  a  statement as to the period for which  a  publicdemand is due, was not applicable to a public demand like  aloan  due to the Government in respect of which there is  noquestion of any period for which it is due.The  Rajasthan Public Demands Recovery Act did not  off	 endArt.  14 of the Constitution as giving special	facility  tothe  Government as a banker for the recovery of	 the  bank'sdues  for,  the	 Government can legitimately  be  put  in  aseparate class for this purpose.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 88 of 1957.Appeal	from the judgment and order dated January 18,  1956,of  the Rajasthan High Court (Jaipur Bench) in	D.B.C.	WritPetition No. 262 of 1954.S.   K. Kapur and Ganpat Rai, for the appellants.N.   S. Bindra and D. Gupta, for the respondents.1960.	December 7. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySARKAR,	  J.-The   appellants  are  traders   of   Jhalawar.Respondent No. 1, the Collector of Jhalawar, ,served on	 theappellants  a  notice under s. 6 of  the  ,Rajasthan  PublicDemands	 Recovery Act, 1952, hereafter called the  Act,	 forthe   recovery	from  them  as	a  public  demand,  of	 Rs.2,24,607/6/6  said  to be due on account of loans  taken  bythem  from the Jhalawar State Bank.  The appellants filed  apetition under s.   8  of  the Act contending,	among  otherthings, that964the amount sought to be recovered from them was not a publicdemand.	  Respondent No. 1 appears to have called  upon	 theappellants  to prove that it was not a public  demand.	 Theappellants without proceeding further before respondent	 No.1,  filed a petition in the High Court of Rajasthan for	 theissue  of a writ quashing the proceedings under	 the  PublicDemands Recovery Act.  The High Court dismissed the petitionbut  granted  a	 certificate that the case was	fit  for  anappeal to this Court.  Hence the present appeal.The only question raised in this appeal is whether any	loandue  to	 the  Jhalawar State Bank could be  recovered  as  apublic demand.	A "public demand" within the meaning of	 theAct  is	 "any  money  payable to  the  Government  or  to  adepartment or an officer of Government under or in pursuanceof a written instrument or agreement".	The Government	heremeans the Government of Rajasthan for the Act was passed  in1952 by the Rajasthan State Legislature.  The question	thenis  whether money due to the Jhalawar State Bank,  is  moneypayable to the Government of Rajasthan.Now,  the Jhalawar State Bank was started in 1932.  At	thattime  Jhalawar	was a ruling State.  Sometime  in  or  aboutApril,	1948, the State of Jhalawar, along with	 nine  otherruling States of Rajputana, integrated and formed the UnitedState  of Rajasthan under a covenant executed by the  Rulersof  these  States.   One of the articles  of  this  covenantprovided, "All the assets and liabilities of the covenantingStates	shall  be the assets and liabilities of	 the  UnitedState."	 Subsequently,	on  March 30, 1949,  the  States  ofBikaner,  Jaipur,  Jaisalmer and Jodhpur joined	 the  UnitedState of Rajasthan.  On the promulgation of the Constitutionof  India,  the United State of Rajasthan became  a  Part  BState  in  the	Indian Union.  The assets  of  the  previousruling	State of Jhalawar, which had earlier vested  in	 theUnited State of Rajasthan, thereupon passed to and  devolvedupon the State of Rajasthan in the Indian Union.965The  proceedings under the Act against the  appellants	werestarted by the filing of a requisition with respondent No. 1by respondents Nos. 2 and 3, being respectively the TreasuryOfficer, Jhalawar, and the Recovery Officer, Jhalawar  StateBank, under s. 3 of the Act stating that the amount  earliermentioned  was due from the appellants to the Government  ofRajasthan  in  respect of the claims of the  Jhalawar  StateBank  against them.  This was done presumably shortly  priorto  June 16, 1953, on which date respondent No. 1  signed  acertificate specifying the amount of the demand and  certainother particulars and filed it in his own office under s.  4of  the	 Act.	A notice of the signing and  filing  of	 thecertificate was served upon the appellants under s. 6 of theAct.   This notice and the subsequent proceedings have	beenreferred to in the beginning of this judgment.The  claim thus is in respect of moneys due to the  JhalawarState  Bank.   If  that Bank was not  the  property  of	 theJhalawar  State, then its dues cannot of course be  said  tohave  merged  in  the  present	State  of  Rajasthan.	 Theappellants first contended that the Jhalawar State Bank	 wasnot  the  property  of	the State  of  Jhalawar.   The	onlymaterial to which we have been referred by the appellants insupport	 of this contention is certain rules framed  by	 theRuler  of Jhalawar in respect of the Bank.  It	was  pointedout  that the rules showed that the Bank was like any  othercommercial enterprise.	We are unable to agree that for thisreason	it  could  not be an institution  belonging  to	 theState.	 There	was nothing to prevent	the  Jhalawar  Statecarrying  on  a commercial undertaking.	 If it did  so,	 theassets of that undertaking would be those of the State	and,in the circumstances earlier mentioned, must now be held  tobe vested in the State of Rajasthan.It  was also said that the rules showed that the  managementof  the	 Bank was in the hands of a board of  which  certainnon-officials  were  members.  It was  contended  that	thisshowed that the Bank was not the property of the State.	  Itis clear, however, from the122966rules  that  the  Bank was not the property  of	 the  board.Again,	the board was constituted from time to time  by	 theRuler  and the majority of its members were officers of	 theState.	 This would show that the Ruler was in full  controlof the management of the Bank as a State undertaking.  It istrue  that the rules indicate that the Bank might sue or  besued  in respect of transactions made by or with it.   That,however,  would	 not indicate that the Bank had	 a  separateidentity.   The	 rules in this connection only	indicate  inwhat  name suits could be brought by or against the  State'sbanking business.  On the other hand, it is perfectly  clearthat  the  capital of the Bank was derived solely  from	 thefunds of the Jhalawar State.  No part of it was	 contributedby  anyone  else.   One of the objects of the  Bank  was  toinvest	 the  surplus  funds  of  the  State.	The   entiretransaction of the business of the Bank was in the  ultimatecontrol	 of  the Ruler.	 The Jhalawar State  guaranteed	 thefinancial liabilities of the Bank.  The name "Jhalawar StateBank"  also indicates that the institution belonged  to	 theState  of Jhalawar.  About the time of the formation of	 theUnited	State  of  Rajasthan in 1948,  the  Chief  ExecutiveOfficer,  Jhalawar, issued a public notification  in  which,after  referring  to  the  article  in	the  Covenant  whichprovided that the assets and liabilities of the	 covenantingStates	would  be the assets and liabilities of	 the  UnitedState, he proceeded to state that by virtue of this article,on  the formation of the new State, the	 responsibility	 andguarantee  of the existing transactions with  the  differentdepartments  of Jhalawar State or the Jhalawar	State  Bank,would  be  of the newly formed United  State  of  Rajasthan.This  would show that the assets of the Jhalawar State	Bankwere being treated by all concerned as assets of the  formerJhalawar  State,  which, upon the formation  of	 the  UnitedState  of  Rajasthan,  had  vested  in	the  latter   State.Further,  no one else has at any time made any claim to	 theassets of the Jhalawar State Bank.  It is, therefore,  clearbeyond	all doubt, that the Jhalawar State Bank was  one  ofthe assets of Jhalawar State and is now vested in the  Stateof Rajasthan.967The second point argued for the appellants is that the	duesof the Jhalawar State Bank have in any case been transferredby the Government of Rajasthan to the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.under  certain	Notifications to which	we  shall  presentlyrefer.	 It is said that the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.  is,  asits name shows, obviously a limited company having an  inde-pendent existence and is not a department of the  Governmentof Rajasthan State.  It is also contended that this  vestingtook place before the proceedings under the Act had started.Therefore,  it	is said that at the  commencement  of  thoseproceedings,  the amount claimed from the appellants as	 dueto  the Jhalawar State Bank, was not a public demand  withinthe meaning of the Act.This contention which is based on the Notifications, earliermentioned, does not seem to us to be well founded.  We	willassume	for the present purpose that the Bank  of  RajasthanLtd.  is  not a department of the  Government  of  RajasthanState.	 The  question	is  whether  the  effect  of   theseNotifications,	which  were two in number, was to  vest	 thedues  of  the Jhalawar State Bank in the Bank  of  RajasthanLtd.   The  first Notification is dated February  15,  1951.It, stated that the Government of the State of Rajasthan haddecided to transfer, among others, the Jhalawar State  Bank,to the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.  It was contended that by thisNotification  the  assets  of the Jhalwar  State  Bank	weretransferred  to the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd.  We do not  thinkthat that was the effect of this Notification.	It containedtwo very significant provisions which we set out below:"All  debtors of the State Banks irrespective of the  class,category  and  nature of the debt are hereby  informed	thatwithin one month from the date of publication of this noticethey  should clear accounts with the aforesaid	State  Bankswhich  will  continue  to function only	 to  clear  the	 oldaccounts, and thereafter their accounts with the  securitiespledged	 will  automatically be transferred to the  Bank  ofRajasthan  Ltd.,  who will be authorised on  behalf  of	 theState, to effect necessary recoveries and settle accounts.968The  transfer of these debts to the Bank of  Rajasthan	Ltd.will not, on any account, take away the inherent right whichthe  Rajasthan Govt. possess in these  various	transactionsmade on the guarantee of the respective convenanting  Statesto  make recoveries and settle accounts in  accordance	withthe  existing  rules or laws that may hereafter be  made  toeffect recovery of State dues or State debts."It is clear from these provisions that the Bank of RajasthanLtd. was being authorised "on behalf of the State", that is,the  Government	 of the State of Rajasthan, to	recover	 theamounts due to the Jhalawar State Bank.	 The transfer of thelatter Bank to the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. was to be  subjectto this qualification that its dues would remain the dues ofthe  Government of the State of Rajasthan and would only  berecovered by the Bank of Rajasthan Ltd. as the agent of thatGovernment.   The  last paragraph set out  above  emphasisesthis Position.	It preserves the right of the Government  ofthe  State  of Rajasthan to recover the amounts due  to	 theJhalawar State Bank in accordance with any law that might bemade after the date of the Notification.  The position	thenis  that  under	 this  Notification the	 debts	due  to	 theJhalawar Bank were not transferred to the Bank of  RajasthanLtd.  and remained payable to the Government  of  Rajasthan.The  other  Notification  is dated April 16,  1952,  and  itrepeats	  that	 the   banks  mentioned	  in   the   earlierNotification,  including the Jhalawar State Bank,  "will  bemerged	in the Bank of Rajasthan Limited".  It is said	thatthe  effect of this Notification was in any event to  cancelthe earlier Notification, in so far as the latter  preservedthe power of the State to collect the debts of the  JhalawarState  Bank.  We are wholly unable to agree.   This  Notifi-cation	only reiterates the intention of the  Government  ofthe State of Rajasthan to merge the banks named, in the Bankof  Rajasthan Ltd.  It says nothing specifically  about	 thedues  of these banks or as to their recoveries, with  regardto   which,  therefore,	 the  provisions  of  the   previousNotification  must  have  effect.   Furthermore,  there	  isnothing to show that the debts969due  to	 the  Jhalawar	State  Bank  were  by  any  documentspecifically  transferred  to  or  vested  in  the  Bank  ofRajasthan  Ltd.	 and thereupon became  its  property.	Thatbeing  so,  there is no basis for the  contention  that	 thedebts  due  from the appellants are now due to the  Bank  ofRajasthan Ltd. in its own right.  It would follow that	suchdebts  remained debts due to the Government of the State  ofRajasthan.The third point argued was that the moneys claimed from	 theappellants  were not payable under a written  instrument  oragreement.  This contention is wholly unfounded.  It appearsthat  the loans were granted by the Jhalawar State  Bank  tothe   appellants  on  their  own  applications.	   In	eachapplication  the appellants stated that they wanted  a	loanfrom  the Jhalawar State Bank and promised to repay it	withinterest at the rate mentioned in it.  By these applicationsthe   appellants  also	proposed  to   hypothecate   variousproperties  belonging  to  them	 as  security  for  the	 duerepayment of the loans taken.  They signed the	applicationsand  the receipts, which latter also bore the signatures  ofthe  officers  of the Bank in token of the sanction  of	 theloan.  In our view, the money payable by the appellants	 waspayable	 under	these  applications and	 receipts  and	was,therefore, payable under written instruments or	 agreements.A  point was sought to be made that in each case there	weretwo documents, namely, the application by the appellants andthe receipt for the moneys advanced signed by them,  whereasa  public  demand  as  defined	in  the	 Act,  required	 oneinstrument.   It  is  enough  to  say  in  regard  to	thiscontention  that the Act does not say that the moneys  shallbe due under a single instrument.  It is well-known that  ina statute a singular includes the plural.  In any case,	 thetwo documents constituted the written agreement between	 theparties and that is enough to satisfy the requirement of theAct, even if read in the way suggested by the appellants.The fourth point advanced was that the certificate under theAct  was  defective  and therefore the	proceedings  were  anullity.  Section 4 of the Act requires that the certificateshall be in the prescribed form.970One  of the particulars to be stated in the  form,  requiresthat  the  period  for which the demand was  due  should  bespecified.  That period was not specified in the certificatein the present case.  It seems to us however that this is nodefect.	  In the case of loans due, there is no question  ofany  period  for which the demand is  due.   Obviously,	 therequirement as to, the specification of the period was meantto  apply where the demand consisted of a claim for  revenueor rent or the like, which could be due for a period.  It isclear  to us that the requirement as to stating	 the  periodfor which the demand is due, as appears from the  prescribedform,  does  not  arise in the case of a  loan	due  to	 theGovernment  which is a public demand within the Act  and  insuch  a case no question of stating the period arises.	 Thecertificate was not, therefore, defective.The last point argued was that in so far as the Act  enablesmoneys	due  to	 the Government in respect  of	its  tradingactivities  to	be  recovered by way of	 public	 demand,  itoffends	 Art. 14 of the Constitution.  It is said  that	 theAct  makes  a  distinction between  other  bankers  and	 theGovernment as a banker, in respect of the recovery of moneysdue.  It seems to us that the Government, even as a  banker,can  be legitimately put in a separate class.  The  dues  ofthe Government of a State are the dues of the entire  peopleof the State.  This being the position, a law giving specialfacility for the recovery of such dues cannot, in any event,be said to offend Art. 14 of the Constitution.We  have now discussed all the points raised in this  appealand  are unable, for the reasons earlier mentioned, to	findmerit  in  any	of  them.  In the  result  we  come  to	 theconclusion that the amount claimed from the appellants was apublic demand within the meaning of the Act and was  legallyrecoverable  by	 the  impugned	proceedings.   This   appealtherefore  must	 be  dismissed	with  costs  and  we   orderaccordingly					  Appeal dismissed.971
