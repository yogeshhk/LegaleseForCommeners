During the period from 1930 to 1941-42 hepurchased  a large number of shares and securities which  bythe  accounting year 1941-42 were of a value Rs. 1491  lacs.He  sold  certain  shares and securities  of  the  value  ofseveral	 lacs  and made certain amount of  profit  on  thosesales.	 In  1940 the appellant borrowed a large  amount  ofmoney from his brother, the Maharaja of Darbhanga and openeda  new	account	 named account No.  2  which  contained	 allentries regarding shares purchased and sold out of the moneyborrowed from the Maharaja.  In the assessment year  1944-45to 1948-49 the profits made by the(1) [1961] 3 S.C.R. 279.288appellant  from	 purchase  and sale of	shares	amounted  toseveral	 lacs  and the Income-tax Officer held those  to  beliable	to  income-tax as business profits.   The  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner upheld the assessments but  excludedthe  profits for the years 1944-45.  On appeal by  both	 theparties the Appellate Tribunal held on the evidence that theappellant  was	to  be regarded as a dealer  in	 shares	 andsecurities  and	 therefore the profits	were  assessable  toincome-tax.   The  High	 Court	stated	the  following	 twoquestions under s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act and  answeredthem in the affirmative:-"(1)  Whether  in the circumstances of the  case,  there  ismaterial  to support the finding of the	 Appellate  Tribunalthat the assessee was a dealer in shares and securities withrespect to each of the account and, therefore, liable to  betaxed?(2)Whether  having regard to the finding of the	 AppellateTribunal  in respect of 1941-42 assessment, it- was open  tothe Appellate Tribunal in the present case to hold that	 theprofits and transactions of sale and purchase of shares	 andsecurities amounted to profits of business and so liable  tobe taxed?"On  appeal  by special leave the appellant  contended  interalia, that being a Zamindar the buying and selling of shareswas not his normal activity and he did not carry on any suchbusiness  but his purchases and sales were in the nature  ofinvestments  of his surplus monies and therefore the  excessamounts received by sales were capital receipts being merelysurplus and not profits.Held, that on the materials produced and on the facts provedthe  appellant must be held to have been  rightly  assessed.The  principle applicable to such transactions is that	whenan owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it andobtains	 a higher price for it than the original price	paidby  him,  the enhanced price is not a profit  assessable  toincome tax, but where as in the present case what is done isnot  merely a realisation or a change of investment  but  anact done in what is truly the carrying on of a business	 theamount recovered as appreciation will be assessable.G.Venkataswami Naidu & Co. v.

The	 High Court could not interfere	 with  thosefindings  and  it  rightly answered  the  questions  in	 theaffirmative.There is no such thing as res judicata in income-tax matters289and it was quite open to the Appellate Tribunal to give	 thefinding that it did.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 137 to	 141of 1958.Appeals	 by special leave from the judgment and order  datedApril  26, 1956 of the Patna High Court in  Misc.

The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyKAPUR,	J.-The	assessee who is the  appellant	has  broughtthese  five  appeals against the judgment and order  of	 theHigh  Court of Patna by which it answered the two  questionsstated	under s. 66(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act  againstthe  appellant and in favour of the Commissioner of  Income-tax.The  appellant	is the son of the  late	 Maharajadhiraja  ofDarbhanga  and	the brother of the  present  Maharaja.	 Thefather	died in 1929 and the appellant was given by  way  ofmaintenance  the  Estate of Rajnagar.  He was also  given  ayearly allowance of Rs. 30,000 which was later raised to Rs.48,000.	 From 1929, the appellant invested his cash  surplusin  shares and securities, the account of which was  enteredin  what  is called Account Book No. 1. From the  year	1930onwards	 up  to the year 1941-42 the appellant	purchased  alarge	number	of  shares  and	 securities  which  by	 theaccounting year 1941-42 were of the value of Rs. 14.91 lacs.During this period the appellant sold shares and  securitiesin the accounting years 1936-37 and 1939-40 of the value  of1.48  lacs  and	 1.69 lacs respectively.   He  made  certainamount	of  profits on these sales but under orders  of	 theCommissioner  of  Income-tax in the former case and  of	 theIncome-tax Tribunal in the latter case, these sums were	 notassessed to income-tax.	 In the290accounting years 1942-43 to 1946-47 the appellant  purchasedand  sold  some	 shares and  securities.   The	 entries  inAccount No. 1 stood as follows:-  Total value of    Total cost of      Total cost of shares  shares  &  securities	 shares and    and  securities	soldcost at the	       securities pur	during the year.  beginning of the    chased during the     year.	       year.1350 Fs.

Rs. 3.39 lacs1946-47			     ( 9items)		  (2 items)and  in	 all these years the appellant	made  profits  whichvaried	from Rs. 2,56,959 in the accounting year  194243  toRs. 33,174 in the accounting year 1946-47.On  July 16, 1940, the appellant arranged an overdraft	withthe  Mercantile	 Bank  of India and  actually  withdrew	 Rs.10,000	for  the purchase of shares.  But  his	brother	 theMaharaja  advanced to him without interest Rs. 10  lacs	 andthus  the overdraft was paid off.  A new Account was  openedin the books of the appellant named No. 2 Investment Accountwhich  contained all entries in regard to  shares  purchasedand   sold  from  out  of  the	money  borrowed	  from	 theMaharajadhiraj.	  In this account entries of  the  differentyears were as follows:-292was held not to. be taxable.  Thus in the second period	 theassessee was held not to be carrying on	 any trade.  In	 thethird period, i.e., the assessment years 1944-45 to  1948-49the profits made by the appellant from purchase and sale  ofshares were as	follows:-1944-45...Rs.2,62,000 and odd1945-46...Rs.3,95,000 and odd1946-47...Rs.1,57,000 and odd1947-48...Rs.1,33,000 and odd1948-49...Rs.  76,000 and oddThe Income-Tax Officer held these to be liable to income-taxas  business  profits.	On appeal  the	Appellate  AssistantCommissioner excluded the profits for the years 1944-45	 and1945-46 but for the years 1946-47 to 1948-49 the assessmentswere  upheld.	Both  parties  appealed	 to  the   AppellateTribunal.  It held on the evidence that the appellant was tobe  regarded  as  a  dealer in	shares	and  securities	 andtherefore  the profits were assessable to  income-tax.	 Theappellant applied for a case to be stated under s. 66(1)  ofthe Income-tax Act.  This application was dismissed but	 theHigh  Court made an order under s. 66(2) of  the  Income-taxAct to state a case on two questions of law.  The  questionswere as follows:	      (1)...Whether  in	 the  circumstances  of	 the	      case, there is material to support the finding	      of  the Appellate Tribunal that  the  assessee	      was  a  dealer in shares and  securities	with	      respect	to   each  of  the   accounts	and,	      therefore, liable to be taxed?	      (2)...Whether,  having regard to the  findings	      of  the  Appellate  Tribunal  in	respect	  of	      1941/42	assessment,  it	 was  open  to	 the	      Appellate Tribunal in the present case to hold	      that the profits and the transactions of	sale	      and purchase of shares and securities amounted	      to  profits  of business and so liable  to  be	      taxed ?The  High Court held that the facts and circumstances  whichthe  Tribunal  took into consideration in  arriving  at	 thefinding were the material before the Tribunal to support thefinding and the first question293was  answered in the affirmative and therefore	against	 theappellant.  In regard to the second question the answer	 wasagain in the affirmative and against', the appellant who hascome to this Court by special leave.It  was	 argued on behalf of the appellant that he  was	 notcarrying  on the business of buying and selling	 shares	 buthis purchases and sales were in the nature of investments ofhis surplus monies and therefore the excess amounts receivedby sales were capital receipts being merely surplus and	 notprofits.   It was also submitted that the appellant being  azamindar the buying and selling of shares was not his normalactivity; that he had a large income and it was his  surplusincome	which  he  was investing in buying  the	 shares	 andwhenever  he found it profitable he converted  his  holdingsand securities and for a number of years from 1931-32 he hadbeen  buying shares but he did not sell them; that the	verynature	of  investments	 was  such  that  they	had  to	  beconstantly  changed so that the monies invested may be	usedto  the best advantage of the investor; and that  the  saleswere  really for the purpose of reemploying the monies	thathe had invested to his best advantage.Counsel	 for  the  appellant relied upon  certain  cases  insupport of his submission that the first question raised wasof  a  wider  amplitude and that  it  had  been	 erroneouslyrestricted  by the High Court and that its true	 import	 wasthe  same  as  of the questions which  were  raised  in	 thefollowing  cases  decided by this Court.  He  relied  on  G.Venkataswami  Naidu & Co. v. The Commissioner of  Income-tax(1),  Oriental Investment Co., Ltd. v. The  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax,  Bombay  (2).  In the former case  the  assesseepurchased four plots of land adjacent to the mills of  whichhe was the Managing Agent.  On various dates and about	fiveyears  later  sold them to the mills in	 which	he  realizedabout Rs. 43,000 in excess of his purchase price.  This	 wastreated	 by  the Income-tax authorities as purchase  with  aview to sell at a profit.  The question referred was whetherthere was material for the(1) [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 646.(2) [1958] S.C.R. 49.294assessment  of	that  amount  as  income  arising  from	  anadventure in the nature of trade.  The High Court held	thatthat  was  the nature of the transaction.   On	appeal	thisCourt  held  that  before the Tribunal	could  come  to	 theconclusion that it was an adventure in the 'nature of trade,it  had	 to take into consideration the	 legal	requirementsassociated  with  the concept of the trade or  business	 andthat  such a question was a mixed question of law and  fact.It  was also held that where a person invests money in	landintending  to hold it and then sells it at a profit it is  acase  of  capital accretion and not profit derived  from  anadventure  in the nature of trade but if a purchase is	madesolely	and exclusively with the intention to resell  it  atprofit and the purchaser never had any intention to hold theproperty  for  himself there would be a	 strong	 presumptionthat the transaction is in the nature of trade but that	 wasalso a rebuttable presumption.	The purchase in the  absenceof  any	 rebutting evidence was held to fall in	 the  lattercategory,  i.e., adventure in the nature of trade.   In	 theOriental  Investment case(1) the assessee was an  investmentcompany.  It had purchased certain shares and sold them	 andqua those shares it claimed to be treated as an investor andnot  a	dealer on the ground that it did not  carry  on	 anybusiness in the purchase and sale of shares.  The assessee'sapplications  for reference to the High Court-were  rejectedon the ground that no question of law arose out of the orderof the Tribunal.  It was held that the question whether	 theassessee's  business  amounted to dealing in shares  and  inproperties or was merely an investment was a mixed  questionof law and fact and the legal effect of the facts found	 wasa  question  of law and this Court ordered the	case  to  bestated	on  two	 questions  that  it  framed.	One  of	 thequestions  was similar to the first question in the  presentcase but the second question was a wider one, i.e.,  whetherthe profits and losses arising from the sale of shares	etc.could be taxed as business profits.The question which the High Court had to answer(1)  [1958] S.C.R. 49.295in the present case was a narrow one and the answer to	thaton  the material before the Court was rightly given  in	 theaffirmative.  But even if the question is taken to be  widerin  amplitude,	on the materials produced and on  the  factsproved	the  appellant	must be held to	 have  been  rightlyassessed.  Counsel for the appellant argued that the amountsreceived  by him in the accounting years were in the  natureof  capital  accretions and therefore not,  assessable.	  Insupport,  Counsel for the appellant relied on the  followingcases:-Raja   Bahadur	Kamakshya  Narain   Singh   v.	 TheCommissioner  of Income-Tax, Bihar & Orissa (1)	 where	LordWright observed that profits realised by the sale of  sharesmay  be	 capital  if  the seller  is  an  ordinary  investorchanging  his  securities but in some instances	 it  may  beincome if the seller of the shares is an investment  companyor  an insurance company.  The other cases relied upon	wereCalifornian  Copper Syndicate Limited v. Harris (2);  Cooperv. Stubbs (3); Leeming v. Jones (4) and Edwards v.  Bairstow& Harrison (5). ....It	is  not necessary to  discuss  thesecases because..the principle applicable to such transactionsis that...when an owner of an ordinary investment chooses torealise	 it  and  obtains  a higher price  for	it  than  heoriginally  acquired  it  at, the enhanced price  is  not  aprofit assessable to income tax but where as in the  presentcase what is done is not merely a realisation or a change ofinvestment but an act done in what is truly the carrying  onof  a business the amount recovered as appreciation will  beassessable.In  July  1948 the appellant had  borrowed,  though  withoutinterest,  a large sum of money to the extent of  about	 Rs.10,00,000,  no	doubt from his brother.	 He  started  a	 newaccount	 calling  it  No. 2  Investment	 Account.   For	 theassessment years under appeal shares purchased and sold wereof  a large magnitude ranging from Rs. 4.68 lacs to  Rs.  69thousands  in what is called the first account and from	 Rs.9,64,000 or even if Port Trust Debentures are excluded(1) [1943] L.R.70 I.A. 180,194.	    (2) [1904] 5 T.C. 259.(3) [1925] 10 T.C. 29, 57.	     (4) [1930] 15 T.C. 333(5)..[1955] 36 T.C. 207.296Rs. 3,60,000 to Rs. 30,000.  The magnitude and the frequencyand  the ratio of sales to purchases and total holdings	 wasevidence from which the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal  couldcome  to  the  conclusion  as to  the  true  nature  of	 theactivities  of	the  appellant.	  The  principle  which	  isapplicable  to the present case is what we have	 said  aboveand on the evidence which was before the Tribunal, i.e., thesubstantial nature of the transactions, the manner in  whichthe  books had been maintained, the magnitude of the  sharespurchased  and sold and the ratio between the purchases	 andsales  and  the holdings, if on this material  the  Tribunalcame  to the conclusion that there was material	 to  supportthe  finding that the appellant was dealing in shares  as  abusiness, it could not be interfered with by the High  Courtand in our opinion it rightly answered the question  againstthe appellant in the affirmative.The  second question is wholly unsubstantial.  There  is  nosuch  thing  as	 res judicata in  income-tax  matters.	 TheAppellate  Tribunal  has  placed in  a	tabulated  form	 theactivities  of the appellant showing the buying and  sellingand  the  magnitude  of	 holdings  and	it  cannot  be	saidtherefore that it was not open to the Appellate Tribunal  togive the finding that it did.In  our	 opinion  the High Court rightly  held	against	 theappellant.  The appeals are therefore dismissed with  costs.One hearing fee in this Court.Appeals dismissed.297
