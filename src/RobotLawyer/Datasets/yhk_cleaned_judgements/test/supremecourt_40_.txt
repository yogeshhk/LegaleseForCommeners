C. Mathur, for the appellant (in	 Cr.A. No. 57 of 1960).G....C.	 Mathur,  for the appellant (in Cr.  A.	 No.  58  of1960).Gopal Singh and D. Gupta, for the respondent.1960.	December 5. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySUBBA  RAO, J.-These two appeals raise rather  an  importantquestion on the interpretation of the provisions of s.	207Aof  the Criminal Procedure Code (hereinafter referred to  asthe Code).  'The  facts  that  have given rise to these  appeals  may  bebriefly	 stated.  The appeals arise out of an incident	thattook  place  on	 November 29, 1957, when  one  Sadashiv	 wasmurdered  in the courtyard of his house in village  Nimgaon.The  case of the prosecution was that the  four	 appellants,armed  with  sticks,  went to the  house  of  the  deceased,dragged	 him 'out of the house and beat him with  sticks  inthe  courtyard; and that as a result of the beating he	diedon the next day at about 5 p.m. at Bhandara Hospital.  Afterinvestigation,	the  police submitted their  report  to	 theMagistrate under's. 173 of the Code along with the  relevantdocuments.   After  forwarding the report,  the	 officer  incharge of the; police station furnished892the  appellants	 with a copy of the report  forwarded  undersub-s. (1) of s. 173, the First Information Report  recordedunder  s. 154 and all other documents or  relevant  extractsthereof on which the prosecution proposed to rely, includingthe statements recorded under sub-S. (3) of S. 161 and	alsointimated them of the persons the: prosecution proposed	 to.examine	 as its witnesses.  The Magistrate posted  the	casefor  inquiry  on  February 10, 1958 and	 on  that  date	 theprosecution intimated that it did not intend to examine	 anywitnesses  in  the Magistrate's Court., , On behalf  of	 theappellants no objection was raised, to,that course.  But theMagistrate adjourned the inquiry to February 12, 1958, as hewanted to consider whether any evidence was necessary to  berecorded   before   commitment.	  On  February	 12,   1958,reexpressed his opinion that no witness need. be examined atthat  stage; thereafter, he framed charges  against  accusedappellants  under  s. 302, read with s. 34,  of	 the  IndianPenal Code, and also under s. 448 thereof and committed	 theappellants to the Sessions Court.Before	the learned Sessions Judge the prosecution led	fourtypes of evidence, i.e. (1) eye-witnesses, namely, P.Ws.  6,11, 20 and 25; (2) dying declaration, Ex. P-15, supported byP.   Ws.  18,22	 and  19;  (3)-the  identification  of	 theappellants  in jail by P.Ws. 20 and 25; and (4) recovery  ofvarious articles at, the instance of the accused-appellants.The defence examined four witnesses.  On a consideration  ofthe  entire  evidence,	the  learned  Sessions	Judge	heldthat,the prosecution, case had been amply borne out and thatthe four appellants entered into the house of the   deceasedand beat him in the manner described by the prosecution wit-nesses.	 As. no less than 12 confused wounds were  inflictedon the deceased, which resulted in the fracture of his	ribsand injury to the lung,. and as the, doctor opined that	 thedeath  was due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from	saidfracture,  the learned Sessions Judge hold that the  accusedappellants  were guilty of murder and convicted	 them  unders.302,	read  with a. 34, Indian Penal Code,and	 he  furtherconvicted them, under s. 448 of the Indian893Penal  Code for trespassing into the house of the  deceased.On  these findings the learned Sessions Judge sentenced	 theappellants  to	undergo imprisonment for life on  the  firstcount  and for 3 months rigorous imprisonment on the  secondcount.	 The  appellants preferred an appeal  against  theirconvictions  and  sentences to the High Court of  Bombay  atNagpur.	 The learned Judges of the High Court, on a resurveyof  the entire evidence, agreeing with the learned  SessionsJudge, accepted the prosecution case, but they held that theappellants were guilty only under s. 304, Part 1, read	withs. 34, Indian Penal Code, and in the result they reduced thesentence  from	life  imprisonment  to	10  years'  rigorousimprisonment  in  regard  to appellant 1  and  to  7  years'rigorous  imprisonment	in  regard to  appellants  2  to  4.Against	 the said convictions and sentences, the  appellantshave  preferred,  by special leave, appeals to	this  Court.Criminal  Appeal  No. 57 of 1960 has been preferred  by	 thefirst appellant and Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 1960 by appel-lants 2 to 4.Learned	 counsel  for the appellants raised  before  us	 thefollowing two points: (1) The Sessions Court and, on appeal,the  High Court have not properly appreciated  the  evidenceand  the  circumstances	 of the case  in  holding  that	 theappellants  had	 committed the offences. (2) The  trial	 andconviction of the appellants by the Sessions Court were nulland  void, as the Magistrate had no jurisdiction  to  committhe appellants to Sessions without examining witnesses undersub-s. (4) of s. 207A of the Code and that, as the order  of'committal  was	 without jurisdiction, the  defect  was	 notcured either under s. 532 or s. 537 of the Code.The  first question does not merit any consideration.	Boththe  courts  below have, carefully considered  the  evidenceadduced by the prosecution as well as the accused-appellantsand  have  accepted  the prosecution case.   It	 is  a	wellestablished  practice  of  this Court not  to  interfere  onquestions  of  fact, particularly when they  are  concurrentfindings, except under exceptional circumstances.  We  find,no such exceptional894circumstances in this case.  We, therefore, reject the firstcontention.The  second contention turns upon the interpretation of	 therelevant  provisions  of  S.  207A  of	the  Code.    Beforeattempting  to	construe  the  relevant	 provisions  of	 thesection it would be helpful to notice briefly the history ofthe said section.  Under the Criminal Procedure Code, as  itoriginally  stood,  in the matter of  committal	 proceedingsthere was no distinction between the proceeding	 instituatedon  a  police report and that instituted otherwise  than  onpolice report.	The main object of the committal proceedingswas  to	 hold an inquiry to ascertain and  record  the	casewhich was to be tried before the Court of Sessions.  It	 wasprimarily  to give an opportunity to an accused to  know  inadvance	 the particulars of evidence that would	 be  adducedagainst him in the Court of Sessions so that he could be  ina  position to prepare his defence.  Another  object,  whichwas  no	 less  important, was to enable	 the  Magistrate  todischarge  an  accused	if there was  no  prima	 facie	caseagainst	  him.	  This	 procedure   prevented	 unnecessaryharassment  to such accused and at the same time  saved	 thevaluable  time	of  the Sessions  Court.   In  practice	 thecommittal proceeding, whether intended by the Legislature ornot, served another purpose, namely, it gave an	 opportunityto  the	 accused  to test the credibility  of  witnesses  bybringing out the discrepancies between their evidence in thecommitting court, the statements made by them to the  policeunder  s. 161 of the Code and the evidence given by them  inthe  Court of Sessions.	 Though very often  accused  personstook  full advantage of this additional opportunity to	testthe  veracity  of  the witnesses, as often as  not,  it	 hadturned	out to be duplication of trials with the  resultantslong  delays  in  the  disposal	 of  criminal  cases.	 Theadvantage  of committal proceeding. was not solely  for	 theaccused,  for  the. prosecution by examining  the  witnessesbefore the committing Magistrate secured their testimony  inthe  sense  that though it was tampered	 subsequenty--it  isunfortunately  a frequent phenomenon in	 criminal,  cases-itcould use the said evidence as substantive895one  under  s.	288 of the Code.  The  Legislature,  in	 itswisdom, presumably thought that undue delay in the  disposalof  sessions cases was due to the elaborate  and'  prolongedcommittal  proceedings and stepped in to amend the  Code  inthat respect.  The whole of s. 207A has been inserted by ActXXVI of 1955.  While the section simplified the procedure inregard	to  commitment proceedings instituted  on  a  policereport,	 it confined the existing procedure  to	 proceedingsinitiated otherwise than on a police report.  This  distinc-tion  between  the  two classes of cases  had  a  reasonablefactual	 basis.	 In the case of a police report, a  thoroughinquiry	 would have been made and the investigating  officerwould  have sent a report to the Magistrate under s. 173  ofthe  Code.  The amended s. 173 of the Code also	 enjoins  onthe  officer  in  charge of the police	station	 a  duty  tofurnish before trial, free of cost, to the accused copies ofthe  report forwarded under that section to the	 Magistrate,the  First Information Report recorded under s. 154 and	 allother  documents or relevant extracts thereof on  which	 theprosecution  proposes to rely, including the statements,  ifany,  recorded under s. 164 of the Code and  those  recordedunder sub-s. (3) of s. 161 and a list of witnesses whom	 theprosecution  proposes  to  examine as  its  witnesses.	 TheMagistrate in a proceeding instituted on police report wouldordinarily  be	in  a  position, on  the  said	material  tounderstand  the case of the prosecution and know the  natureof the evidence that would be adduced on the basis of  whichthe accused is sought to be proceeded against.	The  accusedalso  would have an opportunity to know beforehand the	casehe would have to meet and the evidence that would be adducedagainst him.  But in a proceeding instituted otherwise	thanon a police report, no such maternal would be available	 andtherefore  the	old procedure continued to apply to  such  acase.  With this background let us look at the provisions ofs. 207A of the Code.  The relevant provisions of s. 207A  ofthe Code may now be read:Section	 207A: (1) When, in any proceeding instituted  on  apolice report, the Magistrate receives the896report	forwarded  under  section 173,	he  shall,  for	 thepurpose	 of  holding an	 inquiry under this section,  fix  adate which shall be a date not later than fourteen days fromthe   date  of	the  receipt  of  the  report,	unless	 theMagistrate,  for  reasons to be recorded,  fixes  any  laterdate.(2)..If,   at  any  time  before  such	date,  the   officerconducting  the	 prosecution applies to	 the  Magistrate  toissue  a process to compel the attendance of any witness  orthe  production	 of any document or  thing,  the  Magistrateshall issue such process unless, for reasons to be recorded,he deems it unnecessary to do so.(3)..At	 the  commencement of the  inquiry,  the  Magistrateshall,	when the accused appears or is brought	before	him,satisfy	 himself that the documents referred to	 in  section173 have been furnished to the accused and if he finds	thatthe  accused has not been furnished with such  documents  orany of them, he shall cause the same to be so furnished.(4)..The Magistrate shall then proceed to take the  evidenceof  such  persons,  if	any,  as  may  be  produced  by	 theprosecution  as	 witnesses to the actual commission  of	 theoffence	 alleged, and if the Magistrate is. of opinion	thatit  is	necessary in the interests of justice  to  take	 theevidence  of any one or more of the other witnesses for	 theprosecution, he may take such evidence also.(5)..The  accused shall be at liberty to  cross-examine	 thewitnesses examined under sub-section (4), and in such  case,the prosecutor may re-examine them.(6)  When the evidence referred to in sub-section(4)  has  been taken and the Magistrate has  considered	 allthe  documents	referred  to  in section  173  and  has,  ifnecessary, examined the accused for the purpose of  enablinghim  to explain any circumstances appearing in the  evidenceagainst	 him  and given the prosecution and the	 accused  anopportunity of being heard, such Magistrate shall, if he  isof  opinion  that such evidence and  documents	disclose  nogrounds for committing the accused person for trial,  recordhis  reasons  ,and discharge him, unless it appears  to	 theMagistrate897that  such  person should be tried before  himself  or	someother	Magistrate,   in  which	 case  he   shall   proceed,accordingly.(7)..When,  upon such evidence being taken,  such  documentsbeing  considered, such examination (if any) being made	 andthe  prosecution and the accused being given an	 opportunityof  being  heard,  the Magistrate is  of  opinion  that	 theaccused	 should	 be committed for trial, he  shall  frame  acharge	under  his  hand, declaring with  what	offence	 theaccused is charged.On the interpretation, of sub-s. (4), which is the main sub-section under scrutiny in the present case, the High  Courtsin India have expressed conflicting views.  It would not  benecessary  to consider the said decisions in detail, but  itwould  be  enough if we state the conflicting  views,  whichareas follow: (1) Under sub-s. (4) the prosecution is  boundto  examine  all the eye-witnesses indicated in	 the  policereport,	 and  the discretion of- the Magistrate	 to  examinewitnesses  under the second part of the said sub-section  isonly in respect of witnesses other than the  eye-wit-nesses:vide M. Pavalappa v. State of Mysore (1), State v.     AndiBetankar  (2), Ghisa v. State (3 ) and Chandu  Satyanarayanav. The State (4). (2) The Magistrate's power to examine eye-witnesses  under  the first part of sub-s. (4)	is  confinedonly  to  such	witnesses as are produced in  court  by	 theofficer	 conducting  the  prosecution  and  if	he  has	 notproduced  any such witnesses, the Magistrate cannot  examineany  eye-witnesses  under the second part of the  said	sub-section, for, according to this view, the second part  dealswith  only witnesses other than eye-,witnesses. (3)  If	 theprosecution has not produced any eye-witnesses the court maynot  in its discretion examine any witness under the  secondpart, but can, if satisfied, discharge or commit the accusedto sessions on the basis of the documents referred to in  s.178 of the Code: vide State v. Lakshmi Narain (5), State, ofU. P. v. Satyavir (6). (4) The first part confers a power ona Magistrate only to examine the eyewitnesses produced, but(1)  A.I.R. 1957 Mysore 61.(3)  A.I.R. 1919 Raj. 294.(5)  A.I.R. 1960 All. 237.(2)  A.I.R. 1958 Orissa 241.(4)  A.I.R. 1959 A.P.651.(6)  A.I.R. 1959 All. 408.898the  second part empowers him to examine any  witness  otherthan  those produced, whether eyewitnesses or not, and in  acase  where the prosecution failed to discharge its duty  toproduce	 any witnesses or any important	 eye-witnesses,	 thecourt would not be exercising its judicial discretion if  itcommits	 the accused to sessions on the basis  of  documentsreferred  to under s. 173 of the Code without  examining  atleast  the important witnesses: vide State v. Yasin (1),  Inre Pedda Amma Muttigadu (2), A. Ishaque v. The State (3) andManik  Chand  v. The State (4).	 We have  gone	through	 thejudgments  of the High Courts cited at the Bar	and  derivedconsiderable assistance from them for deciding the  questionraised.	  But as the question is to be primarily decided  onthe  interpretation  of the relevant provisions,  we  think,without any disrespect to the learned Judges, that it is notnecessary to consider the said decisions in detail.Now let us look at the relevant provisions of s.  207A	  ofthe Code to ascertain its intendment.  Sub-s.	  (4) is themost important section vis-a-vis the taking of evidence.  Itis in two parts, the first part provides for the examinationof witnesses produced by the prosecution and the second partfor  the  examination  of  other  witnesses.   One  of	 thefundamental rules of interpretation is that if the words  ofa statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous "no moreis  necessary than, to expound those words in their  naturaland  ordinary sense, the words themselves in such case	bestdeclaring the intention of the legislature".  The first partof  the	 sub-section  reads: "The.   Magistrate	 shall	thenproceed to take the evidence of such persons, if any, as maybe  produced by the prosecution as witnesses to	 the  actualcommission of the offence alleged." The word "shall" imposesa  peremptory duty on the Magistrate to take  the  evidence;but  the  nature  of the said evidence	is  clearly  definedthereafter.    The  clause  "as	 may  be  produced  by	 theprosecution  as	 witnesses to the actual commission  of	 theoffence alleged" governs the words "such persons";(1)  A.I.R. 1958 All. 861.(3)  A.I.R. 1958 Cal. 341.(2)  A.I.R. 1959 A.P. 469.(4)  A.I.R. 1958 Cal. 324.899with  the  result that the duty of the	Magistrate  to	takeevidence  is only confined to the witnesses produced by	 theprosecution.   Learned counsel for the	appellants  contendsthat it could not have been the intention of the Legislatureto permit the prosecution to keep back the eye-witnesses  inthe committal court and therefore the word "produced" shouldbe  read  as "cited".  To accept this interpretation  is  tosubstitute the word "cited" in place of the word "produced":such a construction is not permissible, especially, when theplain  meaning of the word used by the Legislature is  clearand unambiguous, and the acceptance of that meaning does notmake  the section otiose.  The phrase "if any"	between	 thewords  "such  persons" and the aforesaid  clause  emphasizesthat  the prosecution may not produce any such	persons,  inwhich  case the obligation to examine such witnesses  cannotarise.	The wording of the second part of the sub-section isalso  without  any  ambiguity  and it  reads:  "and  if	 theMagistrate  is	of  opinion  that it  is  necessary  in	 theinterests of justice to take the evidence of any one or moreof the other witnesses for the prosecution, he may take suchevidence  also." No doubt the word "may" in the	 clause	 "hemay take evidence" imposes duty upon the Magistrate to	takeother  evidence;  but that duty can arise only if he  is  ofopinion that it is necessary in the interests of justice  totake  the  evidence.  The fulfilment of the  condition	thatgives  rise  to the duty is left to the	 discretion  of	 theMagistrate.  The duty to take evidence arises only if he  isof the requisite opinion.  Doubtless the discretion being  ajudicial  one,	it  should be exercised	 reasonably  by	 theMagistrate.  If he exercises it perversely, it may be liableto  be	set aside by a superior court.	If so, what  do	 thewords "other. witnesses" mean?	Do they mean witnesses otherthan eyewitnesses or witnesses, eye-witnesses or not,  otherthan   those   produced	 before	 the  Magistrate,   by	 theprosecution?	The  witnesses	who  will  depose   to	 theprosecution case may be of different categories, namely, (i)witnesses who are eye-witnesses to the actual commission  ofthe offence alleged; (ii) witnesses who speak to the facts900which  afford  a motive for the commission of  the  offence;(iii)  witnesses who speak to the investigation and  to	 thefacts unfurled by the investigation; and (iv) witnesses	 whospeak  to  the	circumstances  and  facts  probablizing	 thecommission of the offence, which is technically described assubstantive  evidence.	 Sub-section  (4)  enjoins  on	 theMagistrate a duty to examine the first category of witnessesproduced  by the prosecution.  The word "actual"  qualifyingthe  word  "commission" emphasises the fact  that  the	saidwitnesses  should be those who have seen the  commission  ofthe  offence.  We have held in interpreting the	 first	partthat  the Magistrate should examine only such witnesses	 whoare  produced before him by the prosecution; but  there	 maynot  be	 eyewitnesses  in  a case, or,	if  there  are,	 theprosecution  may  not have produced all of them	 before	 theMagistrate.   The second part of the  sub-section  thereforeconfers	 a discretionary power on the Magistrate to  examineany  one or more of witnesses of all  categories,  includingthe  eye-witnesses  who	 have  not  been  produced  by	 theprosecution within the meaning of the first part of the saidsub-section.   But  it	is said that  sub-ss.  (6)  and	 (7)indicate  that	taking of evidence by the  Magistrate  is  acondition  precedent for making an order of discharge or  ofcommittal and, therefore, the provisions of Sub-s. (4)	mustbe  so	construed as to impose a duty on the  Magistrate  toexamine	 some witnesses.  Firstly, we cannot hold  that	 thesub-sections  impose  any such condition.  The	argument  isthat  the  clause in subs. (6), namely, "When  the  evidencereferred to in subsection (4) has been taken" is a conditionprecedent  for	making an order of  discharge.	 The  adverb"when" in the clause in the context denotes a point of	timeand  not  a condition precedent.  The clause  means  nothingmore than that an order of discharge can be made under	sub-s. (6) after the events mentioned therein have taken  place.Secondly,   the	 two  clauses  necessarily  refer   to	 thecorresponding  or appropriate situations under	the  earliersub-sections.	The first clause will not come into play  ifthe Magistrate has not taken any evidence.  So too, in	sub-s. (7) also the901adverb "when" denotes the time when the Magistrate can	makethe  order of committal.  If evidence has, not	been  taken,that sub-section is not applicable a the Magistrate proceedsto make an order of committal on other material referred  toin  the	 sub-section.  On the other hand', if the  said	 twosub-sections are construed as imposing a condition precedentfor making an order of discharge or commitment, as the	casemay  be, the said two sub-sections will directly, come	intoconflict with the provisions of sub-s. (4).  When one.	sub-section	 clearly confers a discretion on the  Magistrate  totake or not to take evidence, the other subsections take  itaway.	 It  is	 not  permissible  to  create  conflict	  byconstruction,  when by an alternative construction  all	 thethree sub-sections can be harmonized and reconciled.  If theconstruction suggested by learned counsel for the appellantsbe  adopted,  it would also lead to an anomaly in  that	 theMagistrate,  though  the  documents referred to	 in  s.	 173clearly	 pronounce the innocence of the accused, has  to  gothrough	 the pretence of examining one or more witnesses  tosatisfy the provisions of the sub-section.Reliance  is  placed upon s. 251A of the  Code	relating  towarrant cases whereunder the Magistrate is authorized,	uponconsideration of all the documents referred to in s. 173 andupon   making  such  examination  of  the  accused  as	 theMagistrate thinks necessary and after giving the prosecutionand the accused an opportunity of being heard, to  dischargethe accused, if he considers the charge against the  accusedto  be	groundless; but if he is of opinion  that  there  isground	that  the accused has committed an  offence  allegedagainst him, he shall frame in writing a charge against	 theaccused.  By contrasting this provision with s. 207A, it  iscontended  that if the construction put forward	 by  learnedcounsel is not accepted, the obvious difference between	 thetwo.  procedures  indicated  by	 the  Legislature  would  beobliterated.   We  cannot agree with this  contention.	 Thedifference  between  the two procedures is that, in  a	casecovered by  s. 207A,  evidence will have to be	taken  undercertain902contingencies,	whereas	 under s. 251A no evidence  need  betaken  at all.	That distinguishes the different  proceduresunder  the  two sections and it is not the province  of	 thecourt to add any further conditions or limitations to  thoseprovided by the Legislature.We are fortified in our view by a decision of this Court  inMacherla Hanumantha Rao v. The State of Andhra Pradesh	(1).There the point in controversy was whether sa. 207 and 207A,inserted  in  the  Code by the Amending Act  XXVI  of  1955,violated the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution.	  Insupport of the contention that they violated Art. 14 of	 theConstitution,  it  was	sought	to  be	made  out  that	 theprovisions  of	s.  207A  of the  Code,	 in  comparison	 andcontrast  with other provisions of Ch.	XVIII of  the  Code,prescribed  a  less advantageous position  for	the  accusedpersons	 in a proceeding started under a police report	thanthe  procedure prescribed in other cases in  the  succeedingprovisions of that chapter.  This Court held that there	 wasa reasonable classification to support the difference in theprocedures.   Sinha  J., as he then was, who spoke  for	 theCourt,	in  order  to meet the	argument  based	 on  discri-mination, considered the scope of the new section.  In doingso, the learned Judge observed thus at p. 403:"The  magistrate  then has to record the  evidence  of	suchwitnesses as figure as eye-witnesses to the occurrence,	 andare  produced  before him.  He has also the  power'  in	 theinterest  of justice, to record such other evidence  of	 theprosecution as he may think necessary, but he is not obligedto record any evidence.	 Without recording any evidence	 butafter  considering all the documents referred to in s.	1973and after examining the accused person and after hearing theparties,  it  is  open to the magistrate  to  discharge	 theaccused	 person after recording his reasons that  no  groundfor  committing the accused 1 for trial has been  made	out,unless he decides to try the accused himself or to send	 himfor trial by another magistrate.  If, on the other hand,  hefinds that the accused should be committed for trial, he  isrequired to frame a charge(1) [1958] S.C.R. 396.903disclosing the offence with which the accused is charged."Then the learned Judge proceeded to consider the scope of s.208 of the Code.  After having found that there was  obviousdifference  in the procedure, the learned Judge came to	 theconclusion  that "the Legislature has provided for  a  clearclassification	between the two kinds of proceedings at	 thecommitment  stage based upon a very relevant  consideration,namely, whether or not there has been a previous inquiry  bya  responsible public servant whose duty it is	to  discovercrime  and to bring criminals to speedy justice".   It	willthus  be seen that the observations of the learned Judge  atp. 403 cannot be said to be obiter, as learned counsel	asksus  to	hold, for the construction of the provisions  of  s.207A was necessary to ascertain whether there was reasonableclassification or not.	Assuming that the said	observationsare obiter, even then, they record the considered opinion offive  learned  Judges  of  this Court.	 The  view  we	haveexpressed also is consistentwith the said observations.Our   view   could  now	 be  expressed	in   the   followingpropositions:  (1)  In a proceeding instituted on  a  policereport,	 the  Magistrate is bound to take evidence  of	onlysuch   eye-witnesses  as  are  actually	 produced   by	 theprosecution  in	 court.	 (2) The Magistrate,  if  he  is  ofopinion	 that  it  is in the interest  of  justice  to	takeevidence, whether of eye-witnesses or others, he has a	dutyto  do so. (3) If the Magistrate is not of that opinion	 andif  the prosecution has not examined any  eye-witnesses,  hehas  jurisdiction  to  discharge or commit  the	 accused  tosessions on the basis of the documents referred to in s, 173of the Code. (4) The discretion of the Magistrate under sub-s.   (4)  is  a	 judicial  discretion  and,  therefore,	  inappropriate  cases the order of discharge or  committal,  asthe  case  may be, is liable to be set aside by	 a  superiorcourt.Before	closing	 we would like to  make	 some  observations.Rarely	we come across cases where the prosecution does	 notexamine important eye-witnesses, for such a procedure  wouldentail the danger of the said witnesses being tampered	withby the accused, with904the result that there will not be any evidence taken  by thecommitting  Magistrate	which could be used  as	 substantiveevidence under s. 288 of the Code.  Even if the	 prosecutiontakes  that  risk,  the Magistrate shall  exercise  a  soundjudicial  discretion under the second part of sub-s. (4)  ofs.  207A in forming the opinion whether witnesses should  beexamined   or  not,  and  any  perverse	 exercise  of	thatdiscretion can always be rectified by a superior court.	 Rutthere  may  be a case where the Magistrate can make  up	 hismind  definitely  on  the documents referred to	 in  S.	 173without	 the aid of any oral evidence and in that  event  hewould  be  within  his rights to  discharge  or	 commit	 theaccused,  as  the  case may be.	 In this  view,	 it  is	 notnecessary  to  express	our  opinion  whether  even  if	 theMagistrate acted illegally in committing an accused  withouttaking any evidence, the said illegality is cured either bys.   537 of the Code or any other section thereof.In the result, the appeals fail and are dismissed.				     Appeals dismissed.
