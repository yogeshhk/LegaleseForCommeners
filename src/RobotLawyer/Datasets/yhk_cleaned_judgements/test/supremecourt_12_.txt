N. Kripal and D. Gupta, for the appellant.Sardar Bahadur, for the respondent.1960.  December 13.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredby238KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal pursuant to a certificate of theHigh Court of Kerala against the judgment and order of	thatcourt and the question for decision is the applicability  ofs.  35 of the Indian	Income-tax Act	(hereinafter  termedthe 'Act').The facts which have given rise to the appeal are these: Therespondent is a limited company which owns a spinning  millsat Alwaye.  It commenced business in January, 1951, and	 itsfirst  accounting year ended on December 31, 1951,  and	 therelevant  assessment year is 1952-53.  It filed	 its  returnshowing	 an income Rs. 3,21,284 without taking into  accountthe  amount allowable under s. 15C of the Act.	On  February2,  1953,  the net assessable income of the  respondent	 wasdetermined  at	Rs. 1,47,083 after  deducting  Rs.  1,79,081under s. 15C.  The respondent however declared a dividend ofRs. 4,72,415 which attracted the application of s. 2 of	 theFinance	 Act, 1952, read with Part B, proviso (ii) of  FirstSchedule  and  thus  it	 became liable	to  the	 payment  ofadditional  income tax and this fact was overlooked  by	 theIncome-tax Officer.  After giving notice under s. 35 of	 theAct,  the Income-tax Officer by an order dated	January	 25,1954, rectified this error and imposed an additional tax  atthe rate of one anna in the rupee.  He later discovered thatthis  was  also erroneous and the rate should  have  been  5annas  in  a rupee.  By an order dated August 12,  1954,  herectified  the error.  Under s. 18A, advance income tax	 hadto be paid and the respondent company had deposited only Rs.5,000 and therefore became liable to penal interest under s.18A(8)	of  the	 Act.  By the same order  this	omission  toimpose penal interest was' corrected and this error was thusrectified.Against	 this order the respondent company went in  revisionunder  s. 33A(2) to the Commissioner of Income-tax  but	 therevision  was dismissed.  Thereupon the	 respondent  companyfiled a petition in the High Court of Kerala under Art.	 226of the Constitution on the ground that s. 35 of the Act	 didnot apply and that on the merits additional tax could not beimposed. The High Court by its judgment dated October 31,2391955 held that the orders made were without jurisdiction andtherefore  granted a writ of certiorari quashing the  ordersand the Income-tax Officer has brought this appeal  pursuantto a certificate of that High Court.According  to  the  High  Court, s. 35	of  the	 Act  was  aprovision  for	rectification of "mistakes apparent  on	 therecord"	 and  in  the opinion of the High  Court  it  was  amistake	 analogous  to	O. 47, r. 1 of	the  Code  of  CivilProcedure  for grant of review on the ground of	 mistake  orerror apparent on the face of the record and it construed itin the following words:-	      "i.e. an evident error which does not  require	      any    extraneous	  matter   to	 show	 its	      incorrectness.   The error may be one of	fact	      but  is  not limited to matters  of  fact	 and	      include also errors of law.  But the law	must	      be  definite and capable of ascertainment.  An	      erroneous view of law on a debatable point  or	      a	 wrong	exposition  of the law	or  a  wrong	      application  of the law or a failure to  apply	      the  appropriate	law cannot be  considered  a	      mistake  or error apparent on the face of	 the	      record.	See Chitaley's C.P.C. Col.  III	 pp.	      3549-50, 5th edition."On the ground that the applicability of proviso (ii) of PartB  of  the First Schedule of the Finance Act was  a  complexquestion which could not be said to be "apparent on the faceof  the	 record",  the High Court held	that  the  necessaryfoundation  for the exercise of the powers under s.  35	 hadnot  been laid and therefore the Income-tax Officer  had  nojurisdiction to make the order that he did.  The High  Courtalso held that the levy of penal interest under s. 18A(8) ofthe Act for failure to make advance deposit under s.  18A(3)was also without jurisdiction.The  learned  Judges of the High Court seem to	have  falleninto an error in equating the language and scope of s. 35 ofthe Act with that of O. 47, r. 1, Civil Procedure Code.	 Thelanguage of the two is different because according to s.  35of the Act which provides for rectification of mistakes	 thepower is given to the various income-tax authorities  withinfour years from the date of any assessment passed by them torectify240any  mistake  "apparent from the record" and  in  the  CivilProcedure Code the words are "an error apparent on the	faceof  the record" and the two provisions do not mean the	samething.	 This  court in Maharana  Mills	 (Private)  Ltd.  v.Income-tax Officer, Porbandar (1) has laid down the scope ofs. 35 at p. 358 in the following words:-	      "The  power  under  section  35  is  no  doubt	      limited to rectification of mistakes which are	      apparent	 from	the   record.	 A   mistake	      contemplated by this section is not one  which	      is to be discovered as a result of an argument	      but  it is open to the Income-tax	 Officer  to	      examine the record including the evidence	 and	      if he discovers any mistake he is entitled  to	      rectify the error provided that if the  result	      is  enhancement of assessment or reducing	 the	      refund  then notice has to be  given  to	the	      assessee and he should be allowed a reasonable	      opportunity of being heard."In  that case the error arose because of an initial  mistakein determining the written down value which was subsequentlyrectified.  In an earlier case M. K. Venkatachalam v. BombayDyeing & Manufacturing Co.  Ltd. (2) where as a	 consequenceof  a subsequent amendment of the law  having  retrospectiveeffect,	 the  Income-tax  Officer  reduced  the	 amount	  ofinterest  under	 s.  18A(5)  of the  Act  and  the  assesseeobtained  from the High Court a writ of prohibition  againstthe  Income-tax	 Officer  on the  ground  that	the  mistakecontemplated had to be apparent on the face of the order andnot  a mistake resulting from an amendment of the  law	eventhough it was retrospective in its effect, it was held	thatit   was  a  case  of  error  apparent	from   the   record.Gajendragadkar, J. in his judgment said:-	      "At  the	time  when  the	 Income-tax  Officer	      applied his mind to the question of rectifying	      the  alleged  mistake, there can be  no  doubt	      that  he	had  to read the  principal  Act  as	      containing the inserted proviso as from  April	      1, 1952."Thus this court has held that discovery of an error on(1) [1959] 36 I.T.R. 350.(2) [1958] 34 I.T.R. 143.241the  basis  of	assessment  due to  an	initial	 mistake  indetermining  the  written down value is a mistake  from	 therecord and so is a misapplication of the law even though thelaw  came  into operation retrospectively.   The  Income-taxOfficer, can, under s. 35 of the Act, examine the record andif  he discovers that he has made a mistake he	can  rectifythe  error  and the error which can be corrected may  be  anerror  of fact or of law.  The restrictive operation of	 thepower  of review under 0. 47 R. 1, Civil Procedure  Code  isnot  applicable in the case of s. 35 of the Act and  in	 ouropinion	 it cannot be said that the order of the  Income-taxOfficer	 in  regard  to assessment in  dispute	was  withoutjurisdiction.In  regard  to	s.  18A (8) also  the  learned	Judges	havemisdirected  themselves because that section  is  mandatory.It provides:-	      S.    18A(8)  "Where,  on making	the  regular	      assessment, the Income-tax Officer finds	that	      no payment of tax has been made in  accordance	      with the foregoing provisions of this section,	      interest calculated in the manner laid down in	      sub-section  (6) shall be added to the tax  as	      determined   on  the  basis  of  the   regular	      assessment."Therefore  the Income-tax Officer was required to  calculatethe interest in the manner provided under the provisions  ofthat sub-section and had to add it to the assessment.Counsel	 for the respondent sought to raise the question  asto  the	 applicability of proviso (ii) of Part	B  of  FirstSchedule  of  the  Finance  Act 1952  and  relied  upon	 thejudgments  of  this Court in Commissioner of  Income-tax  v.Elphinstone  Spinning  &  Weaving Mills Co.   Ltd.  (1)	 andsimilar cases reported as Commissioner of Income-tax, BombayCity   v.   Jalgaon  Electric  Supply	Co.    Ltd.(1)	 andCommissioner  of Income-tax, Bombay City v.  Khatau  MakanjiSpinning  and Weaving Co. Ltd. (3); but the facts  of  thosecases were different.  In the first case there was no  totalincome and the(1) [1960] 40 I.T.R. 142.      (2) [1960] 40 I.T.R. 184.(3) [1960] 40 I.T.A. 189.31242Finance Act was not applicable in that case.  In the  secondthere was no profit in any preceding year and therefore	 thefiction	 failed because it postulates that there  should  beundistributed  profits	of  one or  more  years	 immediatelypreceding  the	previous year.	In the third case  also	 theFinance Act was inapplicable because the additional tax	 wasnot  properly  laid  upon  the total  income  and  what	 wasactually  taxed was never a part of the total income of	 theprevious year.In  our opinion the order of the High Court  was  erroneous.We  therefore allow this appeal and set aside  the  judgmentand order of the High Court with costs in this court and  inthe High Court.				   Appeal allowed.		 __________________
