PETITIONER:M/S.  DAMODAR VALLEY CORPORATION	Vs.RESPONDENT:THE STATE OF BIHARDATE OF JUDGMENT:21/11/1960BENCH:SINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.(CJ)BENCH:SINHA, BHUVNESHWAR P.(CJ)IMAM, SYED JAFFERSARKAR, A.K.SUBBARAO, K.SHAH, J.C.CITATION: 1961 AIR  440		  1961 SCR  (2) 522ACT:Sales	Tax-Liability-Agreement	 to  supply  equipment	 andmachinery to contractor--If a sale or hire-Test-Bihar  SalesTax Act, 1947 (19 of 1947) S. 2(g), 13(5), 25.HEADNOTE:The appellant Corporation was assessed to sales tax under S.13(5)  of  the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, on  the  price  ofmachinery  and	equipment, amounting  approximately  to	 Rs.42,63,305, supplied to two contractor firms on the basis  ofan  agreement  which  it  entered into	with  them  for	 theconstruction of a dam.	The agreement provided, inter  alia,that  the price of the machinery and equipment supplied	 wasto  be paid by the contractors and until that was done	theywere  to  remain the property of the  Corporation.   It	 wasfurther	 agreed	 that the Corporation would take  them	overafter the completion of the work at their residual value, tobe  calculated	in  the manner set  out	 in  the  agreement,provided  that	they were properly looked after	 during	 theperiod	of  operation;	and  if	 the  contractors  so  choseearlier, if they were declared surplus and certified as suchby the consulting Engineer.  The price was to be paid in  18equal instalments, two-thirds of which was realisable in anycase,  and  thereafter the Corporation was to  consider	 thedate  or dates of taking them over after assessment  of	 thedepreciation in order to arrive at the residual value.	 TheCorporation was not bound to take over if the residual	lifeof  the equipment fell below one-third of the standard	lifeas fixed by the parties.523The  contractors were to replenish the stock of spare  partssupplied  to them at their own cost.  The  appellant's	casewas  that the transaction represented by the  agreement	 wasnot  a	sale within the meaning of the Act.  The  Sales	 Taxauthorities  held against it and the only question that	 wasultimately  referred  to  the High Court  by  the  Board  ofRevenue	 under S. 25 of the Act was whether the property  inthe  equipment and machinery passed to the  contractors	 andthe transaction amounted to a sale.  The High Court answeredthe   question	 in  the  affirmative,	holding	  that	 thetransaction was a sale within the meaning of s. 2(g) of	 theAct.	The   High  Court  having  refused   the   necessarycertificate, the appellant appealed by special leave grantedby this court.Held,  that  the  appeal must be confined  to  the  questiondebated	 in the High Court.  It is well settled that,  whilefunctioning in its advisory capacity under a taxing statute,the High Court cannot go beyond the question referred to  itor  on	a reference called by it.  That the  appeal  was  byspecial leave could make no difference and the scope of	 thecontroversy  could  not	 be extended beyond  what  could  belegally raised before the High Court.The  two fold test to determine whether a particular  agree-ment is a contract of mere hiring or of purchase on deferredpayments is (1) whether the hirer is under an obligation  topurchase  the  goods  and (2) whether he has  the  right  toreturn	the goods at any time during the subsistence of	 thecontract.   What  has to be considered in each case  is	 thesubstance of the agreement and not the words describing	 itscategory.Helby v. Matthews and others, (1895) A.C. 471, referred to.So judged, there could be no doubt that on the terms of	 theagreement between the parties the transaction in the instantcase was clearly a sale on deferred payments with an  optionto repurchase and not a mere contract of hiring.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 285 of 1959.Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment and Decree  datedthe 13th July, 1956, of the Patna High Court in M.

November  21.	The  Judgment  of  the	Court	 wasdelivered by524SINHA,	C.J.-This  appeal,  by special	leave,	is  directedagainst	 the judgment and order of the High Court  of  Patnadated July 13, 1956 disposing of a reference under s.  25(1)of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947, which hereinafter will  bereferred to as the Act, made by the Board of Revenue, Bihar.The  facts of this case have never been in dispute  and	 mayshortly	  be  stated  as  follows.   The  appellant   is   aCorporation   incorporated   under   the   Damodar    ValleyCorporation  Act  (XIV	of 1948)  and  will  hereinafter  bereferred  to  as  the Corporation.   It	 is  a	multipurposeCorporation, one of its objects being the construction of  anumber	of  dams  in  Bihar  and  Bengal  with	a  view	  tocontrolling  floods  and  utilising  the  stored  water	 forpurposes of generation of electricity.	One of such dams  isthe  Konar Dam in the district of Hazaribagh in Bihar.	 Forthe  construction  of  the  aforesaid  Dam  the	 Corporationentered into an agreement with Messrs Hind Construction Ltd.and  Messrs Patel Engineering Co. Ltd. on May 24, 1950,	 andappointed them contractors for the aforesaid purpose.	Theywill  hereinafter be referred to as the Contractors.   As  aresult	of  a  change in the design of the  Dam,  it  becamenecessary  to  enter into a supplementary agreement  and  onMarch  10, 1951, cl. 8 of Part II of the original  agreementwas  amended and a fresh cl. 8 was substituted.	  Under	 thenew  cl.  8 of the agreement, as  amended,  the	 Corporationagreed	to make available to the contractors such  equipmentas   was  necessary  and  suitable  for	  the	constructionaforesaid.   The  Contractors are charged the  actual  pricepaid by the Corporation for the equipment and machinery thusmade  available, inclusive of freight and customs  duty,  ifany, as also the cost of transport, but excluding sales tax.The  equipment	thus  supplied by  the	Corporation  to	 theContractors  was  classified into two groups,  Group  A	 andGroup  B,  as detailed in Schedule No. 2. The  machinery  inGroup  A  was to be taken over from the Contractors  by	 theCorporation,  after  the  completion of the  work  at  their"residual  value" which was to be calculated in	 the  mannerset  out in the agreement.  The machinery in Group B was  tobecome the525property  of the Contractors after its full price  had	beenpaid  by them.	No more need be said about the machinery  inGroup  B, because there is no dispute about that group,	 theContractors  having  accepted  the  position  that  Group  Bmachinery  had	been  sold to  them.   The  controversy	 nowremaining  between the parties relates to the  machinery  inGroup A.On  August  12,	 1952,	the  Superintendent  of	 Sales	Tax,Hazaribagh,  assessed the Corporation under s. 13(5) of	 theAct  for the period April, 1950 to March, 1952.	 It  is	 notnecessary to set out the details of the tax demand,  becausethe amount is not in controversy.  What was contended beforethe  authorities  below	 and  in this  Court  was  that	 thetransaction  in question did not amount to a  "sale"  withinthe  meaning  of the Act.  The Superintendent  rejected	 thecontention  raised on behalf of the Corporation that it	 wasnot  liable to pay the tax in respect of the machinery	sup-plied to the Contractors.  The Corporation went up in appealto  the	 Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax against  the	saidorder  of assessment.  By his order dated May 5,  1953,	 theDeputy Commissioner rejected the contention of the appellantas  to	its  liability	under  the  Act,  but  made  certainamendments  in the assessment which are not material to	 thepoints	in controversy before us.  The	Deputy	Commissionerrepelling  the Corporation's contentions based on  the	Act,held  inter-alia that the supply of equipment in Group A  ofthe  agreement	aforesaid amounted to a sale and was  not  ahire  ; that the condition in the agreement for the  "takingover"  of  the	equipment on conditions	 laid  down  in	 theagreement  was in its essence a condition of repurchase	 andthat  the Corporation was a "dealer" within the	 meaning  ofthe Act.  The Corporation moved the Board of Revenue, Bihar,in its revisional jurisdiction under s. 24 of the Act.	 TheBoard  of Revenue by its resolution dated October  1,  1953,rejected the revisional application and upheld the order  ofthe authorities below.	Thereafter, the Corporation made  anapplication to the Board of Revenue under  s.	  25 of	 theAct for a reference to refer the following67526questions  to the High Court at Patna, namely,	(a)  whetherthe  assessment under s. 13(5) of the Act  is  maintainable,(b) whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case,  itcan  be	 held  that the property in the	 goods	included  inSchedule A did pass to the Contractors- and the	 transactionamounted  to  a	 sale,	and (c) whether	 the  terms  of	 theagreement  amount to sale transactions with the	 Contractorsand  taking over by the Corporation amounts  to	 repurchase.This application was made on December 22, 1953, but when theapplication for making a reference to the High Court came upfor hearing before the Board of Revenue on May 20, 1954, andafter	the  parties  had  been	 heard,	 counsel   for	 theCorporation sought leave of the Board to withdraw  questions(a) and (c) from the proposed reference and the Board passedthe following order:-"Leave is sought by the learned advocate for the  petitionerto drop questions (a) and (c) from the reference.  The leaveis  granted.  There remains only question (b) for  referenceto the High Court........"Thus  only  question (b) set out above was referred  to	 theHigh  Court for its decision.  After hearing the parties,  aDivision  Bench of the High Court, Ramaswami, C. J. and	 RajKishore	 Prasad,  J., heard the reference and  come  to	 theconclusion  by	its judgment dated July 13, 1956,  that	 thereference  should  be answered in the  affirmative,  namely,that  the transaction in question amounted to a sale  withinthe meaning of s. 2(g) of the Act.Thereupon  the	Corporation made an  application  headed  asunder  Art. 132(1) of the Constitution and prayed  that	 theHigh  Court  "be  pleased to grant leave to  appeal  to	 theSupreme	 Court of India and grant the necessary	 certificatethat  this  case is otherwise a fit case for appeal  to	 theSupreme Court..... " Apart from raising the ground of attackdealt with by the High Court on the reference as  aforesaid,the  Corporation at the time of the hearing of the  applica-tion appears to have raised other questions as would  appearfrom  the following extract from the judgment and  order  ofthe High Court dated January 31, 1957 :-527"It was conceded by learned counsel for the petitioner	thatthe case does not fulfill the requirements of Article 133(1)of  the Constitution; but the argument is that leave may  begranted under Article 132 of the Constitution as there is  asubstantial   question	 of   law   with   regard   to	 theinterpretation	of the Constitution involved in	 this  case.We are unable to accept this argument as correct.  It is notpossible  for  us  to hold that	 there	is  any	 substantialquestion of law as to the interpretation of the Constitutioninvolved  in this case.	 The question at issue was purely  amatter	of construction of section 2(g) of the	Bihar  SalesTax  Act  and  that question was decided by  this  Court  infavour of the State of Bihar and against the petitioner.  Itis  argued  now	 on  behalf  of	 the  petitioner  that	 theprovisions  of section 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax  Act	 areultra  vires of the Constitution, but no such  question	 wasdealt  with or decided by the High Court in  the  reference.We do not, therefore, consider that this case satisfies	 therequirements  of  Art. 132(1) of the  Constitution  and	 thepetitioner  is	not entitled to grant of a  certificate	 forleave to appeal to the Supreme Court under this Article.The application is accordingly dismissed."Having	failed to obtain the necessary certificate from	 theHigh  Court, the Corporation moved this Court  and  obtainedspecial leave to appeal under Art. 136 of the  Constitution.The leave was granted on March 31, 1958.Though the scope of the decision of the High Court under  s.25  of	the Act on a reference made to it  is  limited,	 theCorporation   has  raised  certain  additional	 points	  ofcontroversy, which did not form part of the decision of	 theHigh Court.  Apart from the question whether the transactionin  question  amounted to a sale within the meaning  of	 theAct,  the statement of the case on behalf of  the  appellantraises	the following additional grounds of attack,  namely,(1) that the Corporation is not a dealer within the  meaningof  the Act, (2) that the proviso to s. 2(g) of the  Act  isultra  vires  the  Bihar Legislature and (3)  that  the	 Actitself is ultra vires the Bihar Legislature by reason of the528legislation being beyond the scope of entry 48 in List II ofSchedule  7 of the Government of India Act, 1935.  Hence,  apreliminary objection was raised on behalf of the respondentthat  the additional grounds of attack were not open to	 theCorporation  in	 this Court.  It  is,  therefore,  necessaryfirst to determine whether the additional grounds of  attackset out above are open to the Corporation.  In our  opinion,those  additional  grounds are not open.   They	 were  neverraised	 at  any  stage	 of  the  proceedings	before	 theauthorities  below,  or in the High Court.   This  Court  issitting in appeal over the decision of the High Court  unders.  25	of  the	 Act.	The High  Court	 in  coming  to	 itsconclusion  was acting only in an advisory capacity.  It  iswell  settled  that the High Court acting  in  its  advisorycapacity  under	 the  taxing statute cannot  go	 beyond	 thequestions  referred to it, or on a reference called  by	 it.The  scope  of	the appeal to this Court,  even	 by  specialleave,	 cannot	 be  extended  beyond  the  scope   of	 thecontroversy  that could have been legally raised before	 theHigh  Court.  It is manifest that the High Court  could	 nothave  expressed	 its opinion on any matter  other  than	 thequestion  actually  before it as a result of  the  referencemade  by  the Board of Revenue.	 The  preliminary  objectionmust,  therefore, be allowed and the appeal limited  to	 thequestion  whether the transaction in question in  this	caseamounted to a sale within the meaning of the Act.It is manifest that this controversy between the parties hasto  be resolved with reference to the terms of the  contractitself.	  Clause  8 of the agreement as amended	 is  a	verycomplex	 one  as will presently appear	from  the  followingextracts, being the relevant portions of that clause :-"The  Corporation  may hire or make available  such  of	 itsequipment as is suitable for construction for the use of theContractor.   The actual prices paid by the Corporation	 forthe  equipment	thus made available, inclusive	of  freight,insurance  and	custom duties, if any, and the cost  of	 itstransport  to  site  but excluding such	 tax  as  sales	 taxwhether local, municipal, State or Central, shall be chargedto the529Contractor  and the equipment shall remain the	property  ofthe  Corporation  until the full prices	 thereof  have	beenrealised  from	the  Contractor.   Equipment  lent  for	 theContractor's  use, if any, shall be charged to him on  termsof hiring to be mutually agreed upon; such terms will  coverinterest  on  capital  cost  and  the  depreciation  of	 theequipment.The Corporation will supply to the Contractor the  machinerymentioned in Schedule No. 2, Group A and Group B below."Then  follows  a description seriatim of the many  items  ofmachinery  in Group A with the number of such machinery	 andthe  approximate cost thereof.	In this Group A,  there	 arefourteen items of which it is only necessary to mention	 thefirst one, that is to say, four excavators with	 accessoriesapproximately  valued  at  Rs. 12,46,390; and  no.  14,	 twoexcavators  of	another	 model,	 approximately	costing	 Rs.3,35,000.   The total approximate cost of the  machinery  inGroup  A is estimated to be Rs. 42,63,305.  Then follow	 thedescriptions  of machinery in Group B, the approximate	costof  which is Rs. 21,84,148.  Then follow certain  conditionsin  respect  of	 equipments included in Group  A,  in  thesewords:-"The  Corporation will take over from the Contractor item  1and  14	 on the completion of the work at a  residual  valuecalculated on the basis of the actual number of hours workedassuming the total life to be 30,000 hours and assuming thatthe  machinery	will  be properly looked  after	 during	 theperiod of its operation.  The remaining items of this  groupwill  be  taken over by the Corporation	 at  their  residualvalue taking into account the actual number of hours  workedand  the standard life of such machinery for which  ScheduleF.  as	last relished, ? of the U. S. Bureau  of  IndustrialRevenue, on the probable useful life and depreciation  ratesallowable  for	Income Tax purpose  (vide  Engineering	NewsRecord dated March 17, 1949) will serve as a basis, providedthat  the  machinery shall be properly looked after  by	 theContractor  during  the period of its  operation.   Providedfurther	 that such residual value of the machinery shall  beassessed530jointly	 by  representatives of the Corporation and  of	 theContractor and that in case of difference of opinion betweenthe  two  parties  the	matter	shall  be  settled   througharbitration  by	 a third party to be agreed to both  by	 theCorporation and the Contractor.The  items included in this group will be taken over by	 theCorporation from the Contractor either on the completion  ofthe work or at an earlier date if the Contractor so  wishes,provided  that	in the latter case the	equipments  will  betaken  over by the Corporation only when they  are  declaredsurplus	 at Konar and such declaration is duly certified  bythe Consulting Engineer, within a period of 15 days of	suchdeclaration being received by the Corporation.In respect of the machinery which shall have been  deliveredto  the Contractor on or before the 31st of  December  1950,their  cost  shall  be	recovered  from	 the  Contractor  ineighteen  equal instalments beginning with January 1951	 andin respect of the remaining items included in this group  ofmachinery, their cost will be recovered from the  Contractorin  eighteen  equal instalments beginning  with	 July  1951,provided   that	 these	remaining  items  shall	 have	beendelivered  to  the Contractor prior to	the  last  specifieddate.Provided-(a)  that the total actual price for these equipments  whichhas  been provisionally estimated at Rs. 42,63,305  will  bechargeable  to the Contractor as per first para of clause  1above.(b)  that after approximately two thirds of total cost or anamount	of  Rs. 28,43,000 (Rupees twenty eight	lakhs  fortythree  thousand) approximately has been recovered  from	 theContractor  on account of these equipments  the	 Corporationwill consider the date or dates when it could take over	 theequipments  still under use by the Contractor,	assess	the,extent	to  which  they have already  been  depreciated	 andthereby arrive at, their residual value; and(c)  that the recovery or refund of the amount payable by orto  the	 Contractor on account of these equipments  will  bedecided	 only  if the Corporation is  fully  satisfied	thattheir residual life at the time of531their  being  finally handed over to the  Corporation  shallunder  no  circumstances  fall	below  one  third  of  theirrespective  standard life as agreed upon by the	 Corporationand the Contractor."Then  follow  terms and conditions in respect of  Group	 'B'which  are  not relevant to our	 purpose.   Thereafter,	 thefollowing conditions appear:-"In  respect  of  equipments whether in Group A	 or  B	madeavailable by the Corporation to the Contractor.The  following	conditions shall apply	to  all	 equipments,i.e.,  those included in Group A and B above and others,  ifany-(a)  The  Contractor  shall  continuously  maintain   propermachine	 cards	separately  in	respect	 of  each  item	  ofequipment,  clearly showing therein, day by day, the  numberof  actual  hours the machine has worked together  with	 thedates and other relevant particulars.(b)  The  Contractor shall maintain all such  equipments  ingood  running condition and shall regularly and	 efficientlygive service to all plant and machinery, as may be  requiredby the Corporation's Chief Engineer who shall have the rightto  inspect,  either personally or  through  his  authorisedrepresentatives all such plant and equipment and the machinecards  maintained in respect thereof at mutually  convenienthours.(c)  No item of equipment made available by the	 Corporationon  loan or hire shall at any time be removed from the	worksite under any circumstances until the full cost thereof hasbeen  recovered from the Contractor by the  Corporation	 andthereafter only if in the opinion of the Consulting Engineerthe  removal of such item or items is not likely  to  impedethe satisfactory prosecution of the work.Similarly no item of equipment or material belonging to	 theContractor  but	 towards the cost of which  money  has	beenadvanced  by  the Corporation shall at any time	 be  removedfrom the work site under any circumstances until the  amountof money so advanced has been recovered from the  Contractorby532the  Corporation  and thereafter if in the  opinion  of	 theConsulting Engineer the removal of such item or items is notlikely to impede the satisfactory prosecution of the work.(d)  The Corporation shall supply to the Contractor whateverspares	have  been  procured or ordered	 for  the  equipmentalready supplied or to be supplied by the Corporation to theContractor  under  the	terms of  this	Agreement  and	thatthereafter the replenishment of the stock of spares shall beentirely  the  responsibility of the  Contractor  who  shalltherefore take active steps in time to procure fresh  sparesso as to maintain a sufficient reserve.The spares to be supplied by the Corporation will be  issuedto  the Contractor by the Executive Engineer, Konar  as	 andwhen  required by the Contractor against indent	 accompaniedby  a certificate that the spares previously issued  to	 himhave  been actually used up on the machines for	 which	theywere intended.(e)  Whenever  spares  are  issued  to	the  Contractor	  inaccordance   with  this	 provision,  their   actual   pricesinclusive  of freight, insurance and customs  but  excludingstorage	 and handling charges shall be debited	against	 himand recovered from his next fortnightly bill.(f)  In order to enable the Contractor to take active  stepsfor  planning  the  procurement	 of  additional	 spares	  inadvance,  the Corporation shall forthwith furnish to  him  acomplete  list	of all the spares which it has	procured  orordered for the equipment to be supplied to the Contractor."The  portions  quoted above contain the relevant  terms	 andconditions in respect of the transaction in question, so faras  it	is necessary to know them for the  purpose  of	thiscase.	It  will  be  noticed  that  the  Corporation	madeavailable  to the Contractors different kinds  of  machineryand  equipment detailed in Group A of the approximate  valueof  Rs.	 42,63,000  odd, for which the	price  paid  by	 theCorporation  inclusive of freight, insurance,  customs	dutyetc.  has to be charged to them.  But the machinery and	 theequipment so533made  available	 to  the  Contractors  were  to	 remain	 theproperty  of the Corporation until the, full  price  thereofhad  been  realised  from  the	Contractors.   It  is	alsonoteworthy  that the agreement makes a	distinction  betweenthe  aforesaid part of the agreement and the equipment	lentto  the contractors in respect of which the contractors	 hadto  be	charged in terms of hiring,  including	interest  oncapital	 cost  and  the	 depreciation  of  equipment.	Thusclearly	 the agreement between the parties contemplated	 twokinds  of  dealings between them, namely (1) the  supply  ofmachinery   and	 equipments  by	 the  Corporation   to	 theContractors and (2) loan on hire of other equipment on termsto  be	mutually  agreed  between them	in  respect  of	 themachinery  and equipment supplied by the Corporation to	 theContractors.	There  is  a  further  condition  that	 theCorporation will take over from the contractors items 1	 and14,  specifically referred to above, and the other items  inGroup  A at their "residual value" calculated on  the  basisindicated in the paragraph following the description of	 themachinery  and	the equipments.	 But there  is	a  conditionadded that the "taking over" is dependent upon the conditionthat the machinery will be properly looked after during	 theperiod	of its operation.  There is an additional  conditionto the taking over by the Corporation, namely, the work	 forwhich they were meant had been completed, or earlier, at thechoice	of the Contractors, provided that they are  declaredsurplus	 for the purposes of the construction of  the  KonarDam and so certified by the Consulting Engineer.  Hence,  itis not an unconditional agreement to take over the machineryand equipment as in Group B. The total approximate price  ofRs.  42,63,305	is payable by the Contractors  in  18  equalinstalments.   Out  of the total cost thus  made  realisablefrom  the  Contractors	two-thirds,  namely,  Rs.  28,42,000approximately,	has to be realised in any case.	  After	 thetwo-thirds  amount  aforesaid  has been	 realised  from	 thecontractors  on account of supply of the equipments  by	 theCorporation,  the  Corporation had to consider the  date  ordates of the "taking over" of the equipment after  assessingthe extent to which it534had depreciated as a result of the working on the project inorder  to arrive at the "residual value" of the	 same.	 Therefund	of the one third of the price or such other  sum  asmay be determined as the "residual value" would depend	uponthe  further  condition	 that  the  Corporation	 was   fullysatisfied  that	 their	"residual  life"  shall,  under	  nocircumstances,	fall  below one-third  of  their  respectivestandard  life	as agreed upon by the  parties.	  It  would,thus,  appear  that  the  "taking  over"  of  such  of	 theequipments  as	were  available to be returned	was  not  anunconditional term.  The Corporation was bound to take	themover only if it was satisfied that their "residual life" wasnot  less than one-third of the standard life fixed  by	 theparties.   It is clear from the terms and conditions  quotedabove  that there was no right in the contractors to  returnany of the machinery and equipments at any time they  liked,or found it convenient to do so.  The conditions which applyto  all	 equipments, whether in Group A or in Group  B,	 arealso  relevant to determine the nature of  the	transaction.The  contractors  are  required	 to  "continuously  maintainproper machine cards showing certain relevant  particulars".It is their duty to maintain the equipments in good  runningcondition and to regularly and effectively service them.  Noitem  of  machinery and equipment could be  removed  by	 thecontractors  under  any circumstances until  the  full	costthereof	 had been recovered from them and even then only  ifthe removal of those items of machinery or equipment was notlikely	to  impede the satisfactory progress  of  the  work.Then   follows	the  most  important  condition	  that	 theContractors  themselves shall have to replenish their  stockof  spare parts of the machinery made available to  them  bythe  Corporation.   When  spare parts are  supplied  to	 theContractors by the Corporation, they shall be liable for theactual price of those parts inclusive of freight,  insuranceand customs duty.Those  substantially are the terms of the  contract  betweenthe parties and the sole question for determination in	thisappeal	 is  whether,  in  respect  of	the  machinery	 andequipments  admittedly	supplied by the Corporation  to	 theContractors, it was a mere535contract of hiring, as contended on behalf of the  appellantCorporation,  or a sale or a hire purchase, as contended  onbehalf	of the respondent State.  The law on the subject  isnot in doubt, but the difficulty arises in applying that lawto  the	 facts and circumstances of a particular case  on  aproper	 construction	of  the	 document   evidencing	 thetransaction between the parties.  It is well settled that  amere  contract of hiring, without more, is a species of	 thecontract  of bailment, which does not create a title in	 thebailee, but the law of hire purchase has undergone consider-able development during the last half a century or more	 andhas  introduced	 a  number of variations,  thus	 leading  tocategories,  and it becomes a question of some nicety as  towhich  category	 a particular contract between	the  partiescomes  under.	Ordinarily,  a	contract  of  hire  purchaseconfers no title on the hirer, but a mere option to purchaseon  fulfillment	 of certain conditions.	 But a	contract  ofhire purchase may also provide for the agreement to purchasethe  thing  hired  by  deferred	 payments  subject  to	 thecondition  that title to the thing shall not pass until	 allthe  instalments  have	been  paid.   There  may  be   othervariations of a contract of hire purchase depending upon theterms  agreed  between the parties.  When  rights  in  thirdparties have been created by acts of parties or by operationof  law, the question, which does not arise here, may  ariseas  to what exactly were the rights and obligations  of	 theparties	 to  the  original contract.  It  is  equally  well-settled	 that  for the purpose of determining  as  to  whichcategory  a particular contract comes under, the court	willlook  at the substance of the agreement and not at the	merewords  describing  the	category.   One	 of  the  tests	  todetermine  the question whether a particular agreement is  acontract  of  mere  hiring or whether it is  a	contract  ofpurchase  on a system of deferred payments 'of the  purchaseprice  is  whether there is any binding	 obligation  on	 thehirer  to  purchase  the  goods.   Another  useful  test  todetermine  such	 a controversy is whether there is  a  rightreserved to the hirer to return the goods at any time duringthe  subsistence of the contract.  If there is such a  rightreserved, then536clearly there is no contract of sale, vide Helby v. Matthewsand others (1).	 Applying these two tests to the transactionin the present case, it becomes clear that it was a case  ofsale  of  goods with a condition of  repurchase	 on  certainconditions   depending	 upon  the   satisfaction   of	 theCorporation  as	 to  whether  the  "residual  life"  of	 themachinery  or the equipment was not less than  one-third  ofthe  standard  life  in accordance  with  the  terms  agreedbetween the parties.  It is clear on those terms that  thereis no right reserved to the contractors to return the  goodsat any time that they found it convenient or necessary.	  Onthe  other  hand, they were bound to pay two-thirds  of	 thetotal  approximate  price  fixed by  the  parties  in  equalinstalments.  The Contractors were not bound under the termsto  return any of the machinery or the equipments,  nor	 wasthe  Corporation  bound to take them  back  unconditionally.The term in the agreement regarding the "taking over" of themachinery or equipments by the Corporation on payment of the"residual  value" is wholly inconsistent with a contract  ofmere hiring and is more consistent with the property in	 thegoods  having  passed  to the Contractors,  subject  to	 thepayment	 of  all  the instalments  of  the  purchase  pride.Furthermore, the stipulation that the Contractors themselveswill have to supply the spare parts, as and when needed, forreplacements  of the worn out parts is also consistent	withthe  case  of the respondent that title had  passed  to	 thecontractors and that they were responsible for the upkeep ofthe  machinery and equipments and for depreciation.   If  itwere a mere contract of hiring, the owner of the goods wouldhave  continued	 to be liable for replacements of  worn	 outparts  and  for depreciation.  Applying those tests  to	 theterms of the agreement between the parties, it is clear thatthe  transaction  was a sale on deferred  payments  with  anoption	to repurchase and not a mere contract of hiring,  ascontended on behalf of the appellant.It  must, therefore, be held that the judgment of  the	HighCourt  is entirely correct and the appeal must be  dismissedwith costs.
