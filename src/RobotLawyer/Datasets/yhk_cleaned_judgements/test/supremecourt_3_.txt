B. Agarwala and K. P. Gupta, for the appellant.G.   C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent.1960.  December 16.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbySHAH, J.-The appellant, Sarjoo Prasad was convicted by P. M.Agra, Magistrate First Class, Allahabad of an offence  unders. 7 read with s. 16 of the Prevention of Food	AdulterationAct, 1954 (37 of 1954)hereinafter referred to as the Act-andin  view of a previous conviction for a similar offence	 wassentenced  to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one year	 andto  pay	 a fine of Rs. 2,000.  The conviction  and  sentencewere  confirmed	 in  appeal  by	 the  Court  of	 Session  atAllahabad  and by the High Court of Judicature at  Allahabadin revision.  The appellant has appealed to this court	withspecial leave under Art. 136 of the Constitution.The appellant was an employee of one Thakur Din who  carrieson  business  at  92-C, Mirganj, Allahabad as  a  vendor  ofedible	oils and provisions.  On September 22, 1956, a	FoodInspector  of the Allahabad Municipality purchased from	 theappellant  a sample of mustard oil exposed for sale  in	 theshop  which  on analysis was found to  be  adulterated	withlinseed	 oil.  Thakur Din and the appellant were  prosecutedin the court of the First Class Magistrate, Allahabad for326selling	 adulterated food.  The Magistrate convicted  ThakurDin and the appellant and sentenced Thakur Din to pay a fineof Rs. 200 and the appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonmentfor one year and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000.The expression "sale" is defined by s. 2(xiii) in the Act asmeaning sale of any article of food, whether for cash or  oncredit	or  by way of exchange and whether by  wholesale  orretail,	 for human consumption or use, or for analysis,	 andincludes  an  agreement	 for sale, an offer  for  sale,	 theexposing  for sale or having in possession for sale  of	 anysuch article, and includes also an attempt to sell any	sucharticle.   The definition includes not only actual sale	 butagreement  for sale, offer for sale, exposure for  sale	 andeven  possession of articles for sale and attempt  to  sell.The  appellant	was in charge of the shop at the  time	whenmustard oil was sold to the Food Inspector.  Mustard oil wasexposed	 for  sale  and	 it was in  the	 possession  of	 theappellant  and	he actually sold it.  But  counsel  for	 theappellant  contends that by s. 7 of the Act, the owner of  ashop alone is prohibited from selling adulterated food,	 anda  servant employed in the shop who sells food on behalf  ofthe employer is not a "person" against whom the	 prohibitionoperates.  Counsel says that an employee in a shop who	withknowledge  that an article of food is adulterated, sells  itis  guilty of aiding and abetting his employer, but  withoutsuch  knowledge	 he  is	 not  liable  to  be  punished	 forcontravening the provisions of the Act.Section 7 of the Act in so far as it is material provides: "No  person  shall himself or by any person on	 his  behalf  -----sell------(1) any adulterated food;The material part of s. 16(1) provides:"If any person,(a)  whether   by   himself  or	 by  any   person   on	 hisbehalf-----sells-----any article of food in contravention..ofthe provisions of this Act or327he shall..................    be punishable...........That  the mustard oil sold by the appellant was	 adulteratedhas  not  been challenged in this appeal.   The	 appellant'splea  that the mustard oil delivered to the  Food  Inspectorwas  not  meant	 for  sale  was	 disbelieved  by  the  TrialMagistrate and that view has been confirmed by the Court  ofSession and the High Court.  The expression "person" has notbeen  defined  in the Act and in the context in	 which	thatexpression  occurs,  it prima facie includes every  one	 whosell   adulterated   food.   By	 the  collocation   of	 theexpression, "no person shall himself or by any person on hisbehalf",   the	employer  alone	 is  not  prohibited.	 Theintention of the Legislature is plain.	Every person, be  hean   employer  or  an  agent  is  prohibited  from   sellingadulterated  food and infringement of the prohibition is  bys.  16 penalised.  By s. 19 in a prosecution for an  offencepertaining  to the sale of any adulterated article of  food,it  is	no  defence merely to allege  that  the	 vendor	 wasignorant  of the nature of the substance or quality  of	 thefood  sold by him.  Such a defence can only succeed  if	 theperson charged with selling adulterated food proves that thearticle of food was purchased as of the same in nature, sub-stance and quality as that demanded by the purchaser with  awritten	 warranty  in the prescribed form, that	 he  had  noreasons to believe at the time when he sold it that the foodwas  not of such nature, substance, and quality and that  hesold it in the same state as he purchased it, and he submitsto  the food inspector or the local authority a copy of	 thewarranty with a written notice that he intends to rely	uponit  and	 specifies the name and address of the	person	fromwhom  he  received it.	Prohibition of sale  of	 adulteratedfood  is  evidently  imposed  in  the  larger  interest	  ofmaintenance  of public health.	The prohibition	 applies  toall persons who sell adulterated food, and for contraventionof the prohibition all such persons are penalised.   Becausethe  Legislature has sought to penalise a person  who  sellsadulterated food by his agent, it cannot be assumed that  itwas intended to328penalise  only those who may act through their	agents.	  Ifthe  owner  of a shop in which adulterated food is  sold  iswithout proof of mens rea liable to be punished for sale  ofadulterated food, we fail to appreciate why   an agent or  aservant	 of  the  owner is not liable  to  be  punished	 forcontravention  of the same provision unless he is  shown  tohave guilty knowledge.The  argument that the Legislature could not  have  intendedhaving regard to the fact that a large majority of  servantsin  shops  which  deal in food are  illiterate	to  penaliseservants who are not aware of the true nature of the articlesold  has  in our judgment no force.  The intention  of	 theLegislature  must  be gathered from the words  used  in	 thestatute and not by any assumptions about the capacity of theoffenders  to  appreciate the gravity of the  acts  done  bythem.  There is also no warrant for the assumption that	 theservants  employed  in	shops  dealing	in  food  stuff	 aregenerally illiterate.The  Legislature has, in the interest of the public  health,enacted	 the  Act  and has provided  that  all	persons	 areprohibited from selling adulterated food.  In the absence ofany  provision,	 express  or necessarily  implied  from	 thecontext,  the courts will not be justified in  holding	thatthe  prohibition was only to apply to the owner of the	shopand  not  to the agent of the owner  who  sells	 adulteratedfood.	The  view taken to the contrary by the	Madras	HighCourt in Re S. Moses (1) is, in our judgment, erroneous.There is no substance in the contention that the  convictionof  the appellant was not for a second offence committed  byhim  under  the Prevention of Food  Adulteration  Act.	 Theprosecutor produced before the court an extract dated  April7, 1956 of a judgment in criminal case No. 208 of 1956 whichshowed that one "Sarjoo Prasad" had been convicted by P.  N.Jauhari,  Magistrate  F-Class, Allahabad of the	 offence  ofadulteration  of mustard oil and sentenced to pay a fine  ofRs. 80.	 In the view of the Magistrate, the extract  relatedto the appellant.  The name of the person convicted and	 hisfather's name and residence were identical with the name  ofthe appellant,(1)  I.L.R. (1959) mad. 418.329his father's name and his residence.  All the details  givenin   the  extract  tallied  with  the  description  of	 theappellant.   In the memorandum of appeal filed to the  Courtof  Session  challenging  the  conviction  recorded  by	 theMagistrate First Class, it was not contended that the personconvicted in the earlier case was some person other than theappellant.But the appellant was merely an employee of Thakur Din.	  Itis  not	 shown that he made himself any profit	out  of	 thetransaction.  Thakur Din has been sentenced to pay a fine ofRs.  200 only.	The offence committed by the appellant is  arepetition  of	a  similar offence committed by	 him  a	 fewmonths	earlier, but we think that having regard to all	 thecircumstances, this is a case in which there are special andadequate reasons which would justify imposition of a penaltyless  than the minimum prescribed by a. 16(ii) of  the	Act.We  reduce the sentence to imprisonment to three months	 andwe remit the fine.  Subject to this modification, the appealis dismissed.			    Appeal dismissed.
