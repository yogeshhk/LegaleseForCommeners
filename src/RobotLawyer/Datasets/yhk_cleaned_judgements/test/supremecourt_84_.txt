That  sectionprovided  that the committee constituted under the  repealedenactment  was to be deemed to have been  constituted  underthe Act and the members thereof should hold office till	 thefirst meeting of the committee was called under S. 35 of theAct.   No  election  was held under the	 new  Act;  the	 oldcommittee, which continued to function, after duly passing aresolution  and	 obtaining the necessary sanction  from	 theGovernment,  sold certain municipal lands to third  parties.The   appellants,   who	 were  rate-payers   of	  the	saidMunicipality,  moved the High Court for-the issue of a	writof quo warranto challenging the said sales under Art. 226 ofthe  Constitution.  The High Court dismissed  the  petition.The contention of the appellants in this Court was that	 themembers of the said committee were functus officio on expiryof three years from the commencement of the Act for s. 34 ofthe  Act prescribed a term of three years and S. 320 of	 theAct  did not provide any definite term for them.  But if  S.34  was	 held to be inapplicable, neither  could  the  firstgeneral	 election under the Act, for which s. 16 of the	 Actwas the only provision, be held, nor could the first meetingof  the	 committee  called under s. 35 of the  Act  and	 theresult	would  be  that the  old  committee  would  continueindefinitely.Held, that the contention must be negatived.The  word  'committee' in s. 320 of the	 Hyderabad  DistrictMunicipalities	Act, 1956, did not mean a committee  electedunder  the Act and the term of three years prescribed by  s.34 of the Act could not, therefore, apply to it.Construed  in  the light of  well-recognised  principles  ofinterpretation	of statutes and the scheme as  envisaged  byss.  16, 17, 18, 20, 32, 34, and 320 of the Act, s.  320  ofthe Act could be no more than a transitory provision and  itwould be unreasonable to suggest that the Legislature  whichrepealed  the  earlier	Act with the  express  intention  ofconstituting	committees   on	   broad-based	  democraticprinciples,   intended	 to   perpetuate   old	  committeesconstituted under the repealed Act.Section	 16(1) of the Act, properly construed,	was  clearlyinapplicable to the first general election under the Act andcould  apply  only to subsequent elections.  So far  as	 thefirst  general election under the Act was concerned, ss.  17and  20 of the Act provided a self-contained and  integratedmachinery therefor independent of s. 16(1) of the Act.Canada	Sugar Refining Co. v. R., [1898] A.C. 735,  referredto.The Legislature in enacting the new Act assumed and expectedthat  the Government would, within a reasonable	 time  issuenotifications  for holding the first general election  underS.   17	 of  the  Act  and its failure to  do  so  and	thusimplement the			    297Act,  and not any inherent inconsistency in the Act  itself,prolonged the life of the old committee.Since  S. 77 of the Act expressly authorised  the  MunicipalCommittee   to	sell  municipal	 property  subject  to	 theconditions  specified  therein,	 no  prohibition  could	  beimplied	 from  the  provisions of s 76 of the  Act  and	 theimpugned  sales, effected in conformity with the  conditionsprecedent  laid down by s. 77 of the Act, could not be	saidto be ultra vires the powers of the committee.Elizabeth Dowager Baroness Wenlock v. The River Dee Company,(1885)	10 A.C. 354 and Attorney-General v. Fulhan  Corpora-tion, (1921) 1 Ch.  D. 440, considered.Per Sarkar, J.-It is well settled that where the language ofa  statute leads to manifest contradiction of  the  apparentpurpose	 of the enactment, as the language of s. 16(i)	doesin  the present case, the Court has the power so to read  itas to carry out the obvious intention of the Legislature.The  intention	of the Legislature in enacting the  new	 Actclearly	 was  that elections should be held  and  committeesconstituted under it.Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher, [1949] 2 All E.R.	155,referred to.Section	 16(1)	is  the	 only  section	of  the	 Act   whichauthorises the holding of a general election but, since	 therequirements  as  to time in s. 16(i) of the Act  could	 notapply  to the first general election, that section  must  beread  to carry out the obvious intention of the	 Legislatureas if there was no such requirement in the case of the firstgeneral	 election  under the Act.  Although this  would	 notindicate  when	that election was to be	 held,	the  obviousimplication  would  be	that  it  must	be  held  within   areasonable time of the commencement of the Act.	 Section  20of  the	 Act  does not authorise the holding  of  a  generalelection.Salmon v. Duncombe, (1886) 11 App.  Cas. 627, referred to.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 387 of 1960.Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and	order  datedFebruary 12, 1960, of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, in WritPetition No. 5 of 1960.P.   A. Choudhuri and K. R. Choudhuri, for the appellants.P.   Ram Reddy, for respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 6 to 11.1960.	November  7. The Judgment of  Gajendragadkar,  SubhaRao, Wanchoo and,.  Mudholkar, JJ.,38298was  delivered	by  Subba Rao, J. Sarkar,  J.,	delivered  aseparate judgment.SUBBA  RAO  J.-This  appeal by	special	 leave	is  directedagainst	 the  judgment of the High Court  of  Judicature  atHyderabad  dismissing the petition filed by  the  appellantsunder  Art. 226 of the Constitution to issue a writ  of	 quowarranto  against  respondents	1 to 10	 directing  them  toexhibit an information as to the authority under which	theyare  functioning  as  members  of  the	Vicarabad  MunicipalCommittee and to restrain them from selling certain plots ofland belonging to the Municipality to third parties.   Vica-rabad  was  originally	situate	 in  the  Part	B  State  ofHyderabad  and is now in the State of Andhra  Pradesh.	 TheMunicipal  Committee of Vicarabad was constituted under	 theHyderabad Municipal and Town Committees Act (XXVII of 1951).In the year 1953 respondents 1 to 10 were elected, and	fiveothers,	 who are not parties before us, were  nominated,  tothat Committee.	 On November 27, 1953, the Rajpramukh of theState  of  Hyderabad  published	 a  notification  under	 therelevant   Acts	  in  the   Hyderabad	Government   GazetteExtraordinary notifying the above persons as members of	 thesaid  Committee.  Presumably with a view to democratize	 thelocal institutions in that part of the country and to  bringthem  on  a par with those prevailing  in  the	neighbouringStates,	 the  Hyderabad District  Municipalities  Act,	1956(XVIII	of 1956), (hereinafter referred to as the Act),	 waspassed	by the Hyderabad _ Legislature and it  received	 theassent of the President on August 9, 1956.  Under s. 320  ofthe  Act  the Hyderabad Municipal and Town  Committees	Act,1951 (XXVII of 1951) and other connected Acts were repealed.As  a  transitory  measure,  under  the	 same  section	 anyCommittee  constituted under the enactment so  repealed	 wasdeemed	to  have  been constituted under  the  Act  and	 themembers	 of  the  said Committee were to  continue  to	holdoffice	till the first meeting of the Committee	 was  calledunder s. 35 of the Act.	 Under that provision respondents  1to  10 and the five nominated members continued to  functionas members			    299of  the Municipal Committee.  In or about the year 1958	 thesaid  Committee	 acquired land measuring acres	15-7  guntasdescribed as " Varad Raja Omar Bagh " for Rs. 18,000 for thepurpose	 of  establishing a grain market  (gunj).   For	 onereason	or  other,  the Municipal Committee  was  not  in  aposition   to  construct  the  grain  market  and   run	  itdepartmentally.	 The Committee, therefore, after taking	 thepermission  of	the  Government,  resolved  by	a  requisitemajority  to  sell  the said land to third  parties  with  acondition  that	 the vendee or vendees	should	construct  abuilding  or buildings for running a grain  market.   There-after  the  Committee sold the land in	different  plots  tothird parties ; but the sale deeds were not executed in viewof  the interim order made in the writ petition by the	HighCourt and subsequently in the appeal by this Court.In  the writ petition the appellants contended, inter  alia,that  the respondents ceased to be members of the  MunicipalCommittee on the expiry of three years from the date the newAct  came into force and that, therefore, they had no  rightto  sell the land, and that, in any view, the sale  made  bythe  Committee of the property acquired for the	 purpose  ofconstructing a market was ultra vires the provisions of	 theAct.   The  respondents contested the  petition	 on  variousgrounds.  The learned Judges of the High Court dismissed thepetition with costs for the following reasons:1.   The old Committee will continue to function till a	   newCommittee comes into existence.2.   "	Section 76 contemplates that property vested  in  itunder  s.  72(f), 73 and 74 should be  transferred  only  toGovernment.   Here,  the transfer is not in  favour  of	 theGovernment.   That  apart  we are told that  in	 this casesanction of the Government was obtained at every stage.	  Itcannot	be  predicated	that  the  purpose  for	 which	 theproperties  are	 being	disposed of is	not  for  a,  publicpurpose.   It is not disputed that the properties are  beingsold only to persons who are required to build grain  market".3.   The act now opposed is not in any way in conflict	withthe provisions of ss. 244, 245 and 247.3004.   "	It  looks to us that the petitioners  lack  in	bonafides  and  that  this	petition is  not  conceived  in	 theinterests of the public ".The present appeal, as aforesaid, was filed by special leavegranted by this Court.Mr.  P.	 A. Chowdury, learned counsel  for  the	 appellants,canvassed the correctness of the findings of the High Court.His  first argument may be summarized thus: Under s. 320  ofthe  Act  any  Committee  constituted  under  the   repealedenactment shall be deemed to have been constituted under theAct and the members of the said Committee shall continue  tohold  office  till  the first meeting of  the  Committee  iscalled under s. 35 of the Act.	Under s. 35 of the Act,	 thefirst  meeting of the Committee shall not be held on a	dateprior to the date on which the term of the outgoing  membersexpires	 under s. 34.  Section 34 of the Act  provides	thatthe  members  shall hold office for a term of  three  years.Therefore,  the term of the members of the Committee  deemedto  have been constituted under s. 320 is three	 years	fromthe  date  on which the Act came into force.   If  the	termfixed Under s. 34 does not apply to the members of the	saidCommittee,  the	 result will be that the said  members	willcontinue to hold office indefinitely, for the first  meetingof the Committee could not be legally convened under the Actas s. 16 which enables the Collector to do so imposes a dutyon him to hold a general election within three months beforethe  expiry  of	 the term of office of the  members  of	 theCommittee  as specified in s. 34, and, as no  definite	termhas  been prescribed for the members of the Committee  unders.  320, the election machinery fails, with the result	thatthe members of the " deemed " Committee would continue to bemembers of the said Committee indefinitely.  On this  inter-pretation learned counsel contends that the section would bevoid for the following reasons: (1) s. 320(1)(a) of the	 Actwould  be  ultra vires the powers of the  State	 Legislatureunder Art. 246 of the Constitution, read with entry 5,	ListII,  VII  Schedule;  (2)  the  said  section  deprives	 theappellants  of the right to equality and protection  of	 thelaws guaranteed under Art. 14301of  the	 Constitution;	(3) s. 320 would  be  void  also  asinconsistent with the entire scheme of the provisions of theAct.Let us first test the validity of the construction of s. 320of  the Act suggested by the learned counsel.  The  materialpart of s. 320 reads:" (1) The Hyderabad Municipal and Town Committees Act, 1951,(XXVII of 1951)........................ (is) hereby repealed; provided that:-(a)  any Committee constituted under the enactment so  repealed(hereinafter referred to in this section as  the	saidCommittee)  shall be deemed to have been  constituted  underthis Act, and Members of the said Committee shall  continueto  hold office till the first meeting of the  Committee  iscalled under section 35;".The terms of the section are clear and do not lend any scopefor argument.  The section makes a distinction between the "said"  Committee and the Committee elected under  the.	 Actand says, " Members of the said Committee shall continue  tohold  office  till  the first meeting of  the  Committee  iscalled	under  s.  35 ". Though the  word  "  Committee"  isdefined	 in  s. 2(5) to mean a Municipal or  Town  Committeeestablished or deemed to be established under the Act,	thatdefinition  must give way if there is anything repugnant  inthe  subject  or  context.  As the  section  makes  a  cleardistinction between the " said " Committee and the Committeeelected	 under the Act, in the context, the Committee in  s.320  cannot mean the Committee elected under the  Act.	 Theterm  fixed  for the members of	 the  Committee	 constitutedunder  the Act cannot apply to the members of the  Committeedeemed	to have been constituted under the Act.	 Section  32which  provides for the culminating stage of the process  ofelection  under the Act says that the names of	all  membersfinally	  elected  to  any  Committee  shall  be   forthwithpublished  in the official Gazette.  Section  34  prescribesthe  term of office of the members so elected.	Under it,  "except	as is otherwise provided in this Act, members  shallhold  office for a term of three years."  Section  320(1)(a)provides a different term for the302members	 of  the Committee deemed to have  been	 constitutedunder  the  Act.  Thereunder, the term is fixed not  by	 anynumber	of  years  but by the happening of  an	event.	 TheCommittee  constituted under s. 320 clearly falls under	 theexception.   But it is suggested that the  exception  refersonly to s. 28 whereunder a member of a, Committee ceases  tobe  one	 by a supervening disqualification.   Firstly,	thissection	  does	 not  fix  a  term  but	  only	 imposes   adisqualification  on the basis of a term fixed under s.	 34;secondly, assuming that the said section also fixes a  term,the exception may as well cover both the deviations from thenormal	rule.  That apart, sub-s. (2) of s. 34	dispels	 anydoubt that may arise on the construction of sub-section	 (1)of  the	 section.  Under sub-s. (2), the term of  office  ofsuch members shall be deemed to commence on the date of	 thefirst meeting called by the Collector under s. 35.   Section35  directs the Collector to call a meeting after giving  atleast  five  clear days notice within thirty days  from	 thedate of the publication of the names of members under s. 32.This  provision	 clearly indicates that the members  of	 theCommittee  mentioned in s. 34 are only the  members  electedunder  the Act and not members of tile Committee  deemed  tohave  been elected under the Act, for, in the case  of	thelatter Committee, no publication under s. 32 is provided forand therefore the provisions of s. 35 cannot apply to  them.It is, therefore, manifest that the term prescribed in s. 34cannot apply to a member of the deemed " Committee.Let us now see whether this interpretation would necessarilylead us to hold that the members of the " deemed " Committeeunder s. 320(1)(a) would have an indefinite duration.	Thisresult,	  it  is  suggested,  would  flow  from	 a   correctinterpretation	of the relevant provisions of s. 16  of	 theAct.  The judgment of the High Court does not disclose	thatany argument was addressed before that Court on the basis ofs.  16	of the Act.  But we allowed the learned	 counsel  toraise the point as in effect it is only a link in the  chainof his argument to persuade us to hold in his favour on	 theconstruction of s. 320.			    303Before we consider this argument in some detail, it will  beconvenient  at	this  stage  to	 notice	 some  of  the	wellestablished  rules  of Construction which would help  us  tosteer  clear  of  the  complications  created  by  the	Act.Maxwell	 "  On the Interpretation of Statutes",	 10th  Edn.,says at p. 7 thus:"..............	  if  the  choice  is  between	two   inter-pretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve	 themanifest  purpose  of  the legislation, we  should  avoid  aconstruction which would reduce the legislation to  futilityand  should rather accept the bolder construction  based  onthe  view  that	 Parliament would  legislate  only  for	 thepurpose of bringing about an effective result."It is said in Craies on Statute Law, 5th Edn., at p. 82--Manifest  absurdity  or	 futility,  palpable  injustice,  orabsurd inconvenience or anomaly to be avoided.')Lord  Davey  in	 Canada Sugar Refining Co.  v.	R.  providesanother	 useful	 guide	of correct  perspective	 to  such  aproblem in the following words:"  Every  clause  of  a statute	 should	 be  construed	withreference  to the context and the other clauses of the	Act,so as, so far as possible, to make a consistent enactment ofthe  whole  statute or series of statutes  relating  to	 thesubject-matter."To appreciate the problem presented and to give an  adequateanswer to the same, it would be necessary and convenient  tonotice	the scheme of the Act as reflected in  the  relevantsections,  namely, ss. 16, 17, 18, 20, 32, 34 and 320.	 Thesaid  scheme of the Act may be stated thus: Under  the	Act,there	are  general  elections	 and  elections	 to   casualvacancies.   The general elections may be in regard  to	 thefirst  election	 after	the Act came into force	 or  to	 thesubsequent  elections  under the Act.  Section 5  imposes  aduty  on the Government to constitute a Municipal  Committeefor  each town and notify the date when it shall  come	intoexistence.  Section 17 enjoins on the Government to issue  anotification  calling upon all the constituencies  to  electmembers in accordance(1)  [1898] A.C. 735.304with  the provisions of the, Act on or before such  date  ordates as may be specified in the said notification.  Section16  imposes  a	duty upon the Collector to  hold  a  generalelection in the manner prescribed within three months beforethe  expiry  of	 the term of office of the  members  of	 theCommittee as specified in s. 34 of the Act.  Sub-section (2)of  s.	16 provides for a bye-election for filling up  of  acasual	vacancy.  Section 18 enables the Collector with	 theapproval  of  the  Government to  designate  or	 nominate  aReturning  Officer.  Section 19 imposes a duty upon such  anofficer	 to do all such acts and things as may be  necessaryfor  effectually  conducting  the  election  in	 the  mannerprovided by the Act and the rules made there under.  Section20  authorizes the Collector to issue a notification in	 theOfficial   Gazette   appointing	  the	dates	for   makingnominations,  for  the	scrutiny  of  nominations,  for	 thewithdrawal of candidatures and for the holding of the  poll.After  the elections are held in the manner prescribed,	 thenames  of all the members finally elected to  any  Committeeshall  be  published  in the Official  Gazette.	  Except  asother,wise provided in the Act, s. 34 prescribes the term ofthree  years  for  a member so	elected.   As  a  transitoryprovision  till such an election is held, s. 320  says	thatthe members of the previous Committee constituted under	 theearlier Act shall be deemed to be constituted under the	 Actand  the  members thereof shall hold office till  the  firstmeeting of the Committee is called under s. 35 of the Act.It   is	 clear	from  the  aforesaid  provisions  that	 theGovernment   notifies  the  dates  calling  upon   all	 theconstituencies	to  elect the members before  such  date  ordates prescribed; the Collector holds the election and fixesthe dates for the various stages of the process of  election; the Returning Officer appointed by the Collector does	 allacts  and  things necessary for effectually  conducting	 theelection.On  the	 general scheme of the Act we do not see  any  legalobjection to the Collector holding the first elections underthe Act.  The legal obstacle for such a course is sought  tobe raised on the wording of s. 16(1).305Every general election requisite for the purpose of this Actshall  be  held by the Collector in  the  manner  prescribedwithin three months before the expiry of the term of  officeof the members of the Committee as specified in section 34."The argument is that the Collector's power to hold a generalelection is confined to s. 16(1) and, as in the case of	 themembers	 of  the Committee deemed to have  been	 constitutedunder  the Act the second limb of the section  cannot  applyand  as the Collector's power is limited by the second	limbof the section, the Collector has no power to hold the firstgeneral	 election under the Act.  If this interpretation  beaccepted, the Act would become a dead-letter and-the obviousintention  of  the Legislature would be	 defeated.   Such  aconstruction cannot be accepted except in cases of  absoluteintractability of the language used.While  the  Legislature	 repealed the earlier  Act  with  anexpress	 intention  to constitute new  Committees  on  broadbased  democratic  principles, by  this	 interpretation	 theCommittee under the old Act perpetuates itself indefinitely.In  our	 view,	s.  16(1) does not  have  any  such  effect.Section	 16(1)	may be read along with the  aforesaid  otherrelevant  provisions  of the Act.  If so read, it  would  beclear  that it could not apply to the first  election  afterthe  Act  came	into  force,  but  should  be  confined	  tosubsequent elections.  So far as the first general  electionis  concerned,	there  is a  self-contained  and  integratedmachinery  for	holding	 the election  without	in  any	 waycalling	 in  aid  the provisions of s.	16(1).	 Section  17applies	 to all elections, that is, general as well as	bye-elections.  It applies to the first general election as wellas  subsequent	general	 elections.   The  proviso  to	thatsection says that for the purpose of holding elections undersub-s. (1) of s. 16 no such notification shall be issued  atany  time earlier than four months before the expiry of	 theterm of office of the members of the Committee as  specifiedin  s.	34.  The proviso can be given full meaning,  for  itprovides  only	for a case covered by s. 16(1) and,  as	 thefirst general election is outside the scope of s. 16(1),39306it  also  falls outside the scope of the proviso to  S.	 17.Under  s. 17, therefore, the Government, in respect  of	 thefirst general election, calls upon all the constituencies toelect  members before the date or dates fixed by it.   Unders. 20, the Collector fixes the dates for the various  stagesof  the election.  The Returning Officer does all  the	actsand  things necessary for conducting the election  and	whenthe election process is completed, the names of the  memberselected	 are  published.   All these  can  be  done  withoutreference  to s. 16(1), for the Collector is also  empoweredunder  s.  20 to hold the elections.  In  this	view,  therecannot	be  any legal difficulty for  conducting  the  firstelection, after the Act came into force.  If so, the term ofthe  members  of the Committee deemed to have  been  electedwould come to an end when the first meeting of the Committeewas called under s. 35.	 The Legislature in enacting the lawnot only assumed but also expected that the Government wouldissue  the  requisite notification under s. 17	of  the	 Actwithin	a  reasonable time from the date when the  Act	cameinto force.  The scheme of the Act should be judged on	thatbasis;	if  so judged, the sections disclose  an  integratedscheme giving s. 320 a transitory character.It  is conceded by learned counsel that if s.  320(1)(a)  isconstructed   in  the  manner  we  do,	the   other   pointsparticularised above do not arise for consideration.Before	leaving this part of the case we must  observe	thatthe  difficulty is created not by the provisions of the	 Actbut by the fact of the Government not proceeding under s. 17of  the Act within a reasonable time from the date on  whichthe  Act  came into force.  This is a typical  case  of	 thelegislative  intention being obstructed or deflected by	 theinaction of the executive.Mr.  Ram Reddy, learned counsel for the respondents,  statesthat there are many good reasons why the Government did	 notimplement the Act.  There may be many such reasons, but whenthe  Legislature  made	an  Act in  1956,  with	 a  view  todemocratize  municipal	administration in that part  of	 thecountry	 so as to bring it on a par with that  obtaining  inother			    307States, it is no answer to say that the Government had	goodreasons for not implementing the Act.  If the Government hadany  such reasons, that might be an occasion for moving	 theLegislature  to	 repeal	 the Act or to	amend  it.   If	 theaffected parties had filed a writ of mandamus in time,	thissituation could have been avoided ; but it was not done.  Wehope  and  trust that the Government  would  take  immediatesteps  to hold elections to the Municipal Committee so	thatthe body constituted as early as 1953, under a different Actcould be replaced by an elected body under the Act.Even  so, learned counsel for the appellants  contends	thatthe  Municipal	Committee  had no power	 to  sell  the	landacquired  by  it for constructing a market.   To  appreciatethis  contention  it  would  be	 convenient  to	 notice	 therelevant provisions of the Act.	 Under s. 72(f) all land  orother	property  transferred  to  the	Committee   by	 theGovernment  or	the  District Board  or	 acquired  by  gift,purchase, or otherwise for local purposes shall vest in	 andbe  under the control of the Committee.	 Section 73  enablesthe  Government,  in  consultation with	 the  Committee,  todirect	that  any property, movable or immovable,  which  isvested	in  it, shall vest in such  Committee.	 Section  74empowers  the Government on the request of the Committee  toacquire any land for the purposes of the Act.  Under s.	 76,the  Committee	may, with the sanction	of  the	 Government,transfer  to  the  Government any  property  vested  in	 theCommittee  under  ss.  72(f), 73 and 74, but not  so  as  toaffect	any  trust  or public right  subject  to  which	 theproperty  is  held.  Learned counsel contends that,  as	 theland was acquired by the Committee for the construction of amarket, the Committee has power to transfer the same to	 theGovernment  only subject to the conditions laid down  in  s.76,  and  that	it has no power to sell the  land  to  thirdparties.  This argument ignores the express intention of  s.77 of the Act.	Section 77 says:"  Subject  to	such exceptions as  the	 Government  may  bygeneral or special order direct, no Committee shall transferany  immovable property except in pursuance of a  resolutionpassed at a meeting by a308majority  of not less than two-third of the whole number  ofmembers	 and in accordance with rules made under  this	Act,and no Committee shall transfer any property which has	beenvested	in it by the Government except with the sanction  ofthe Government:Provided that nothing in this section shall apply to  leasesof  immovable property for a term not exceeding three  years".This  section  confers	on the Committee  an  express  powercouched	 in  a negative form.  Negative	 words	are  clearlyprohibitory and are ordinarily used as a legislative  deviceto  make a statute imperative.	If the section is recast  inan  affirmative	 form,	it  reads to  the  effect  that	 theCommittee  shall  have	power  to  transfer  any   immovableproperty, if the conditions laid down under the section	 arecomplied  with.	  The conditions laid down  are:  (1)  thereshall  be a resolution passed at a meeting by a majority  ofnot  less than two-third of the whole number of	 members  ofthe Committee; (2) it shall be in accordance with the  rulesmade under the Act; (3) in the case of a property vested  init by the Government, the transfer can be made only with thesanction of the Government; and (4) the sale is not exemptedby  the	 Government, by general or special order,  from	 theoperation of s. 77 of the Act.	It is not disputed that	 therelevant  conditions have been complied with in the  presentcase.	If  so, the power of the Committee to  alienate	 theproperty cannot be questioned.Learned counsel contends that the provisions of s. 76 governthe  situation and that s. 77 may apply only to	 a  propertyvested in the Committee under provisions other than those ofss.  72(f),  73	 and  74,  and	that  further,	if  a  widerinterpretation	was  given to s. 77, while under s.  76	 thetransfer  in favour of the Government would be subject to  atrust or public right, under s. 77 it would be free from  itif  it	was  transferred  to a	private	 party.	  The  firstobjection has no force, as there are no sections other	thanss.  72, 73 and 74 whereunder the Government vests  propertyin  a Committee.  The second objection also has	 no  merits,for the trust or public right-mentioned in s. 76			    309does  not  appear  to relate to the purpose  for  which	 theproperty  is  purchased	 but to the trust  or  public  rightexisting  over the property so alienated by  the  Committee.Further the proviso to s. 77, which says, " nothing in	thissection	 shall apply to leases of immovable property  for  aterm  not exceeding three years ", indicates that  the	mainsection applies also to the property vested in the Committeeunder  the  previous  section,	for  it	 exempts  from	 theoperation  of the operative part of s. 77 leases for a	termnot  exceeding three years in respect of properties  coveredby   the  preceding  section  and  other   sections.	Thisinterpretation	need not cause any apprehension that a	Com-mittee	may squander away the municipal property, for s.  77is  hedged in by four conditions and the  conditions  affordsufficient   guarantee	against	 improper  and	 improvidentalienations.In  this context learned counsel for the appellants  invokedthe   doctrine	of  law	 that  an  action  of  a   statutorycorporation  may  be ultra vires its  powers  without  beingillegal	 and also the principle that when a statute  confersan  express power, a power inconsistent with that  expresslygiven  cannot be implied.  It is not necessary	to  considerall  the  decisions  cited,  as	 learned  counsel  for	 therespondents  does  not canvass the correctness of  the	saidprinciples.   It would, therefore, be sufficient  to  noticetwo  of	 the decisions cited at the Bar.   The	decision  inElizabeth Dowager Baroness Wenlock v. The River Dee  Company(1) is relied upon in support of the proposition that when acorporation  is authorised to do an act subject	 to  certainconditions, it must be deemed to have been prohibited to  dothe  said  act except in accordance with the  provisions  ofthat Act which confers the authority on it.  Where by Act 14& 15 Viet. a company was empowered to borrow at interest forthe  purposes  of  the concerned Acts,	subject	 to  certainconditions,  it was held that the company was prohibited  bythe  said Act from borrowing except in accordance  with	 theprovisions  of that Act.  Strong reliance is placed  on	 thedecision in Attorney-General v. Fulham Corporation(1) (1885) 10 A.C. 354.(2) (1921) 1 Ch.D. 440.310There,	in exercise of the powers conferred under the  Bathsand  Wash-houses  Acts the Metropolitan	 Borough  of  Fulhampropounded  a  scheme  in substitution	of  an	earlier	 onewhereunder  it	installed  a  wash-house  to  which  personsresorted  for washing their clothes bringing their own	washmaterials  and	utilised  the  facilities  offered  by	 themunicipality on payment of the prescribed charges.  Sarjant,J.,  held that the object of the legislation was to  providefor persons who became customers facilities for doing  theirown  washing,  but the scheme provided for  washing  by	 themunicipality itself and that, therefore, it was ultra  viresthe  statute.	In  coming to that  conclusion	the  learnedJudge, after considering an earlier decision on the subject,applied	 the  following principle to the facts of  the	casebefore him :" That recognises that in every case it is for a corporationof this kind to show that it has affirmatively an  authorityto do particular acts; but that in applying that  principle,the  rule  is  not  to be  applied  too	 narrowly,  and	 thecorporation  is	 entitled  to  do not  only  that  which  isexpressly authorised but that which is reasonably incidentalto or consequential upon that which is in terms authorized."The principle so stated is unobjectionable.The  correctness  of  these  principles	 also  need  not  becanvassed,  for	 the  construction we  have  placed  on	 theprovisions  of the Act does not run counter to any of  theseprinciples.   We  have held that s. 77	confers	 an  expresspower on the Municipal Committee to sell property subject tothe  conditions mentioned therein.  Therefore, the  impugnedsales  are not ultra vires the powers of the Committee.	  Inview  of  the  said express power,  no	prohibition  can  beimplied from the provisions of s. 76.Learned	 counsel further contends that the  statutory  powercan  be	 exercised only for the purposes sanctioned  by	 thestatute,  that	the sales of the acquired  land	 to  privatepersons	 were  not  for	 one of	 such  purposes,  and  that,therefore,  they were void.  The principle that a  statutorybody	can   only   function	within	 the   statute	  isunexcecutionable;  but the			    311Legislature can confer a power on a statutory corporation tosell  its  land is equally uncontestable.  In this  case  wehave  held  that the statute conferred such a power  on	 theMunicipal Committee, subject to stringent limitations.	Manysituations  can	 be  visualized when such a  sale  would  benecessary  and would be to the benefit of  the	corporation.of  course  the	 price fetched by such	sales  can  only  beutilised for the purposes sanctioned by the Act.The last point raised is that the learned Judges of the HighCourt were not justified in holding on the materials  placedbefore	them that the appellants lacked bona fides and	thatthe  petition  filed  by  them	was  not  conceived  in	 theinterests of the public.  We do not find any material on therecord	to  sustain  this  finding.   Indeed,  but  for	 thepetitioner-appellants the extraordinary situation created bythe inaction of the Government in the matter of implementingthe  Act, affecting thereby the municipal administration  ofall  the  districts in Telangana area, might not  have	beenbrought	 to  light.  We cannot describe the  action  of	 theappellants either mala fide or frivolous.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed but, in thecircumstances, without costs.SARKAR,	 J.-The	 first	question is whether  the  first	 tenrespondents are still members of the Municipal Committee  ofVicarabad.  These persons had been elected to the  Committeein   the  elections  held  in  1953  under   the   HyderabadMunicipal  and	Town Commit tees Act,  1951  (Hyderabad	 ActXXVII of 1951), hereafter called the repealed Act.  That Actwas  repealed by the Hyderabad District	 Municipalities	 Act(Hyderabad Act XVIII of 1956), hereafter called the new Act,which  came into force in August 1956.	The appellants,	 whoare  rate-payers  of  the Municipality, contend	 that  on  aproper	reading of the new Act, it must be held	 that  theseten respondents have ceased to be members of the  Committee,and   they  seek  a  writ  of  quo  warranto   against	 therespondents.Section	 320  of  the new Act provides	that  any  Committeeconstituted  under the repealed Act shall be deemed to	havebeen constituted under the new Act312and its members shall continue to hold office till the firstmeeting	 of the Committee is called under s. 35 of  the	 newAct.   The  ten respondents contend that as  admittedly	 themeeting	 under	s.  35 has not been called,  their  term  ofoffice has not yet expired.Now  s. 35, so far as is material, provides that  the  firstmeeting	 of the Committee shall be called by  the  Collectorwithin	thirty days of the date of publication of the  namesof members under s. 32.	 Section 32 states that the names ofmembers finally elected to any Committee shall be  forthwithpublished  in  the  official Gazette.  It  is  quite  clear,therefore, that the Committee mentioned in this section,  isa  Committee constituted by an election held under  the	 newAct.  It would follow that the meeting contemplated in s. 35is a meeting of a Committee constituted by an election	heldunder the new Act.  The provisions of that section put	thisbeyond doubt.In  order,  therefore,	that  a	 meeting  of  the  Committeecontemplated in s. 35 may be held, there has first to be  anelection under the new Act to constitute the Committee.	  Nosuch  election	has  yet been held.   It  is  the  provisionconcerning  election in the new Act that has given  rise  tothe difficulty that arises in this case.  Section 16, sub-s.(1),  gives the power to hold the general elections.  It  isin these words:Every general election requisite for the purpose of this Actshall  be  held by the Collector in  the  manner  prescribedwithin three months before the expiry of the term of  officeof  the members of the Committee as specified in section  34".Section	 34 in substance states that except as	other.	wiseprovided  members of the Committee shall hold office  for  aterm of three years and that term of office shall be  deemedto commence on the date of the first meeting called under s.35.   It would therefore appear that the members whose	termof  office  is sought to be specified by s. 34	are  memberselected under the new Act, for their term is to commence  onthe  date  that they first meet under s. 35 and	 as  earlierstated,	 the  meeting under s. 35 is a	meeting	 of  memberselected under the new Act.			    313The  contention	 for  the appellants is that  if  a.  34  isconstrued  in  the way mentioned above,	 the  first  generalelection  under the new Act cannot be held under s. 16,	 foran election can be held under that section only within threemonths	before the expiry of the term of office	 of  memberselected under the new Act and in the case of first  electionthere are ex hypothesi, no such members.  It is said that asthere  is  no other provision in the new Act for  holding  ageneral election, the Act would then become unworkable,	 forif  the first general election cannot be held no  subsequentelection  can be held either., The result, it is  contended,is  that the Committee elected under the repealed Act  wouldcontinue for ever by virtue of s. 320.	Such a situation, itis said, could not have been intended by the new Act.  It istherefore  suggested  that  s. 34  should  be  construed  asspecifying  a  term  of	 office	 of  three  years  from	 thecommencement  of the new Act for members elected  under	 therepealed  Act who are under s. 320, to be deemed to  form  aCommittee  constituted	under the new Act.  If s. 34  is  soconstrued, then the first general election under the new Actcan properly be held under s. 16.  It is on this basis	thatthe  appellants	 contend that the ten respondents'  term  ofoffice	expired in August, 1959, and they are in  possessionof the office now without any warrant.There  is no doubt that the Act raises some difficulty.	  Itwas  certainly not intended that the members elected to	 theCommittee under the repealed Act should be given a permanenttenure of office nor that there would be no elections  underthe  new Act.  Yet such a result would appear to  follow  ifthe  language used in the new Act is strictly and  literallyinterpreted.   It is however well established that  "  Wherethe  language  of  a statute, in its  ordinary	meaning	 andgrammatical construction, leads to a manifest  contradictionof  the	 apparent  purpose  of the  enactment,	or  to	someinconvenience	or  absurdity,	hardship  or   in   justice,presumably  not intended, a construction may be put upon  itwhich  modifies	 the  meaning of the  words,  and  even	 thestructure of the sentence..................40314Where the main object and intention of a statute are  clear,it  must  not  be reduced to a nullity	by  the	 draftsman'sunskilfulness  or ignorance of the law, except in a case  ofnecessity,  or the absolute intractability of  the  languageused.	Nevertheless,  the  courts  are	 very  reluctant  tosubstitute words in a Statute, or to add words to it, and ithas  been  said that they will only do so where there  is  arepugnancy  to good Bense.": see Maxwell on  Statutes  (10thed.)  p. 229.  In Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v.	 Asher	(1),Denning, L. J., said," when a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his handsand  blame  the	 draftsman.   He must set  to  work  on	 theconstructive	task   of   finding   the    intention	  ofParliament..............  and  then he must  supplement	 thewritten	 word  so  as  to give " force and  life  "  to	 theintention  of the legislature............... A judge  shouldask  himself the question how, if the makers of the Act	 hadthemselves come across this ruck in the texture of it,	theywould  have straightened it out ?  He must then do  as	theywould  have  done.  A judge must not alter the	material  ofwhich  the Act is woven, but he can and should iron out	 thecreases."I  conceive it my duty, therefore, so to read the  new	Act,unless I am prevented by the intractability of the  languageused,  as to make it carry out the obvious intention of	 thelegislature.   Now there does not seem to be  the  slightestdoubt  that the intention of the makers of the new  Act	 wasthat  there should be elections held under it and  that	 theMunicipal Committees should be constituted by such electionsto  run	 the  administration  of  the  municipalities.	 Thesections  to  which  I have so far referred  and  the  otherprovisions  of the new Act make this perfectly plain.	Thuss. 5 provides for the establishment of municipal  committeesand  s.	 8  states that the committees shall  consist  of  acertain number of elected members.  The other sections	showthat the Committees shall have charge of the  administrationof the municipalities for the benefit of the dwellers withinthem.  It is plain(1) [1949] 2 All E.R. 155 ,164.351that  the  entire  object of the new Act would	fail  if  nogeneral election could be held under it.The  question then is, How should the Act be read so  as  tomake  it  possible to hold general elections under  it	?  Iagree with the learned advocate for the appellants that	 theonly section in the new Act providing for general  electionsbeing  held,  is  s.  16(1).  In my view,  s.  20  does	 notauthorise  the	holding	 of any general	 election;  it	onlyprovides  for a notification of the date on which  the	pollshall, if necessary, be taken.	There is no doubt that unders. 16(1) the second and all subsequent general elections canbe held ; in regard to such general elections, no difficultyis  created  by the language of the section.   It  would  becurious	 if s. 20 also provided for general  elections,	 forthen  there would be two provisions in the  Act	 authorisinggeneral elections other than the first.	 Then I find hat allthe  sections referring to general elections refer  to	suchelections  being  held under s. 16(1) and not under  s.	 20.Thus s. 31 provides that if at a general election held unders. 16, no member is elected, a fresh election shall be held.It would follow that if in an election under s. 20, assumingthat  that  section  authorises an election,  no  member  iselected,  no fresh election can be held.  There would be  noreason to make this distinction between elections held unders. 16 and under s. 20.	Again the proviso to s. 17  requiresa certain notification to be issued within a prescribed timefor holding elections under s. 16(1).  If an election can beheld  under s. 20, no such notification need be	 issued	 forthere  is  no provision requiring it.  This could  not	havebeen intended.	For all these reasons it seems to me that s.20 does not confer any power to hold any election.I  have earlier said that the suggestion for the  appellantsis that the best way out of the difficulty is to read s.  34as  specifying	a term of office of three  years  commencingfrom  the coming into force of the new Act, for the  memberselected under the repealed Act who are to be deemed under s.320  to	 be a committee constituted under the new  Act.	  Itseems  to  me  that this is not a correct  solution  of	 theproblem.  First,316the  object  of	 continuing the members	 elected  under	 therepealed  Act  in  office is clearly to have,  what  may  becalled	a  caretaker  committee	 to  do	 the  work  of	 theMunicipality  till  a committee is constituted	by  electionunder the new Act.  It could not have been intended that thecommittee  of  the members elected under  the  repealed	 Actwould  function for three years after the new Act  has	comeinto  operation	 nor that such members would have  the	sameterm  of  office  as  members elected  under  the  new	Act.Secondly,  I  do  not  find  the  language  used  in  s.  34sufficiently tractable to cover by any alteration, a  memberelected	 under the repealed Act.  To meet the suggestion  ofthe  appellants,  a new provision would have really  to	  beenacted	 and  added  to s. 34 and this I  do  not  think  ispermissible.  It would be necessary to add to the section  aprovision that in the case of members elected under the	 oldAct  the term of office of three years would  start  runningfrom  the commencement of the new Act, a provision which  iswholly absent in the section as it stands.  Lastly, so read,s.  34 would come into conflict with s. 320 which  expresslyprovides  that	the term of office of  the  members  electedunder the repealed Act would continue till the first meetingof the committee constituted under the new Act is held unders.  35.	 This portion of s. 320 would have to be  completelystruck out.It seems to me that the real solution of the difficulty liesin construing s. 16(1) so as to authorise the holding of thefirst general election under it and remove the absurdity  ofthere  being  no  provision  directing	the  first   generalelection  to  be held.	Now that section applies  to  ,everygeneral election requisite for the purpose of this Act."  Ittherefore  applies  to	the  first  and	 all  other  generalelections.   The  clear intention hence is  that  the  firstgeneral	 election  will also be held under  this  provision.But  such election cannot be held within the time  mentionedtherein	 for that time has to be calculated from the  expiryof the term of office of the Committee elected under the Actand in the case of the first general election under the	 newAct, there is no such Committee.  The requirement317as to time cannot apply to the first general election.	 Thesection	 has  therefore to be read as if there was  no	suchrequirement  in the case of the first general election.	  Itwill  have  to	be read with the addition  of  the  words  "provided  that	every general election excepting  the  firstgeneral	 election  shall  be  held "  between  the  words  "prescribed  "  and  " within ". That would  'carry  out	 theintention  of the legislature and do the least	violence  tothe  language  used.  So read, there would  be	clear  powerunder  the  Act to hold the first  general  meeting.   Therewould  of  course  then be no indication  as  to  when	thiselection is to be held but that would only mean that it	 hasto  be held within a reasonable time of the commencement  ofthe new Act.The  course  suggested by me is not without the	 support  ofprecedents.   Thus in Salmon v. Duncombe (1),  the  JudicialCommittee in construing a statute omitted from it the  words"  as  if  such natural born subject resided  in  England  "because	 the retention of those words would  have  preventedthe person contemplated getting full power to dispose of hisimmovable property by his will which it was held, the objectof the statute was, he should get.With  regard  to  the other point argued  in  this  .appeal,namely,	 whether  the Municipal Committee even	if  properlyconstituted,  has  power to sell the land mentioned  in	 thepetition, I agree, for the reasons mentioned in the judgmentdelivered by the majority of the members of the bench,	thatit has such power and have nothing to add.The appeal therefore fails.
