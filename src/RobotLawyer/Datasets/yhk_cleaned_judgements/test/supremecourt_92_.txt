The	 appellant  had	 applied  to  the   ElectionCommission for removing the said disqualification but it hadrefused	 to do so.  The appellant's sentence  was,  however,remitted by the Government of Assam under s 401 of the	Codeof  Criminal  Procedure	 and the period	 for  which  he	 wasactually  in  jail was less than two  years.   The  ElectionTribunal held that the nomination paper had been  improperlyrejected  and  set  aside the election but  the	 High  Courttaking a contrary view, dismissed the election petition.Held,  that  the High Court was right in  holding  that	 theappellant   was	  disqualified	 under	S.   7(b)   of	 theRepresentation	of  the People Act and that  his  nominationpaper  had been rightly rejected.  That section speaks of  aconviction and sentence by a Court and an order of remissionof  the	 sentence  under  S. 401 of  the  Code	of  CriminalProcedure,  unlike the grant of a free pardon,	cannot	wipeout either the conviction or the sentence.  Such order is anexecutive  order  that merely affects the execution  of	 thesentence and does not stand on the same footing as an  orderof  Court,  either in appeal or in  revision,  reducing	 thesentence passed by the Trial Court.Venkatesh  Yeshwant Deshpande v.

K. Jha and Sukumar Ghose, for appellants Nos. 1 to 3.G.   S.	 Pathak and Naunit Lal, for respondents Nos.  1	 and2.1960.  October 27.  The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyWANCHOO J.-This is an appeal on a certificate granted by theAssam  High  Court in an election matter.  An  election	 washeld  in the double-member constituency of Goalpara  to	 theAssam Legislative Assembly.  Nomination papers were filed onthe  19th  January, 1957, by a number of  persons  includingAnirara	 Basumatari (hereinafter called the appellant).	  Hewas a candidate for the seat reserved for scheduled  tribes.The  nomination paper of the appellant was rejected  by	 thereturning  officer  on the ground that he  was	disqualifiedunder  s. 7(b) of the Representation of the People Act,	 No.XLIII  of 1951, (hereinafter called the Act).	The  pollingtook place on February 25,1957, and Khagendranath and  H%kimChandra	 Rabha were elected, the latter being a member of  ascheduled  tribe.  Thereupon an election petition was  filedby an elector challenging the election of the two successfulcandidates  on	a  number of  grounds.	 of  these  grounds,however,  only	two are now material, namely, (1)  that	 thenomination paper of the appellant was wrongly rejected,	 and(2) that a corrupt practice was committed by the  successfulcandidates  inasmuch as voters were carried on	mechanicallypropelled  vehicles  to the polling  booths.   The  electiontribunal held on the, first point that the nomination135paper of the appellant had been improperly rejected.  On thesecond	point it hold that the corrupt practice alleged	 hadnot been proved.  In the result, the election was set aside.Thereupon  there  was  an  appeal  by  the  two	  successfulcandidates  to	the High Court. The High Court was  of	theview that the nomination paper of the appellant was properlyrejected;  further on the question of corrupt  practice	 theHigh  Court agreed with the conclusion of the tribunal.	  Inthe result the appeal was allowed and the election  petitionwas ordered to be dismissed.  There was then an	 applicationto the High Court for a certificate to appeal to this  Courtwhich  was granted; and that is how the matter has  come  upbefore us.The  main contention on behalf of the appellant is that	 theHigh  Court was wrong in coming to the conclusion  that	 thenomination  paper  of the appellant  was  properly  rejectedunder  s. 7(b) of the Act.  That provision lays down that  aperson shall be disqualified for being chosen as a member ofeither House of Parliament or of the Legislative Assembly orLegislative Council of a State if he is convicted by a courtin  India of any offence and sentenced to  imprisonment	 fornot  less than two years, unless a period of five years,  orsuch less period as the Election Commission may allow in anyparticular  case,  has	elapsed	 since	his  release.	 Theappellant  in this case was convicted under s. 4(b)  of	 theExplosive  Substances Act No. VI of 1908, and  sentenced  tothree  years  rigorous imprisonment on July 10,	 1953.	 Thenomination paper in this case was filed in January 1957	 andthe  election was held in February 1957 and  therefore	fiveyears  had  not elapsed since his release.  But	 though	 theappellant   was	  sentenced   to   three   years'   rigorousimprisonment, his sentence was remitted by the Government ofAssam  on  November  8, 1954, under s. 401 of  the  Code  ofCriminal Procedure and he was released on November 14, 1954.The contention of the appellant before the election tribunalwas  that in view of this remission his sentence  in  effectwas reduced to a period of less than two years and thereforehe  could  not	be said to  have  incurred  disqualificationwithin the meaning of s.7(b). This contention136was  accepted by the tribunal and that is why it  held	thatthe  nomination	 paper	of  the	 appellant  was	  improperlyrejected.  When the case came to be argued in the High Courton  behalf of the successful candidates, two arguments	wereaddressed  in support of the plea that the nomination  paperof the appellant was properly rejected.	 In the first place,it was urged that in view of the provisions of Articles	 72,73, 161 and 162 of the Constitution read with s. 401 of	 theCode  of  Criminal Procedure, the State	 Government  had  noauthority  to  remit  the sentence  of	the  appellant;	 andsecondly even if the remission was properly granted it wouldnot  affect  the sentence imposed by the Court,	 though	 theappellant might not have had to undergo part of the sentenceafter  the date of the remission order.	 The High Court	 didnot  decide  the  question  as to the  power  of  the  StateGovernment  to	grant remission in this case as it  had	 notfull  materials before it because the matter was not  raisedbefore the tribunal, though it was inclined to the view thatthe  State  Government might not have such power.   But	 theHigh  Court was of the opinion that a remission of  sentencedid  not have the same effect as a free pardon and  did	 nothave  the  effect  of reducing the sentence  passed  on	 theappellant  from	 three years to less than  two	years,	eventhough	the appellant might have remained in jail  for	lessthan two years because of the order of remission.What s. 7(b) lays down is that there should be a  convictionby  a  court  in India for any offence	and  a	sentence  ofimprisonment  for  not less than two years in order  that  aperson	may be disqualified for being chosen as a member  ofeither House of Parliament or of Legislative Assembly or  ofLegislative  Council of a State.  In terms,  therefore,	 theprovision  applies to the case of the appellant for  he	 wasconvicted by a court in India and sentenced to	imprisonmentfor  more than two years.  Further the period of five  yearshad  not  expired  after his  release.	 The  appellant	 hadapplied	  to  the  Election  Commission	 for  removing	 thedisqualification  but  it had refused to do  so.   The	mainquestion therefore that falls for consideration is137whether	 the order of remission has the effect	of  reducingthe  sentence  in  the	same way in which  an  order  of  anappellate  or  revisional criminal court has the  effect  ofreducing  the  sentence	 passed by the trial  court  to	 theextent indicated in the order of the appellate or revisionalcourt.Now it is not disputed that in England and India the  effectof a pardon or what is sometimes called a free pardon is  toclear  the person from all infamy and from all	consequencesof  the	 offence  for  which it	 is  granted  and  from	 allstatutory   or	 other	disqualifications   following	uponconviction.   It  makes	 him, as it were, a  new  man:	(SeeHalsbury's  Laws  of England, Vol.  VII, Third	Edition,  p.244,  para 529).  But the same effect does not follow  on  amere   remission  which	 stands	 on  a	 different   footingaltogether.  In the first place, an order of remission	doesnot  wipe  out the offence; it also does not  wipe  out	 theconviction.   All that it does is to have an effect  on	 theexecution  of  the sentence; though ordinarily	a  convictedperson would have to serve out the full sentence imposed  bya court, he need not do so with respect to that part of	 thesentence which has been ordered to be remitted.	 An order ofremission thus does not in any way interfere with the  orderof the court; it affects only the execution of the  sentencepassed by the court and frees the convicted person from	 hisliability to undergo the full term of imprisonment inflictedby  the court, though the order of conviction  and  sentencepassed	by the court still stands as it was.  The  power  togrant  remission  is  executive power and  cannot  have	 theeffect	which the order of an appellate or revisional  courtwould  have  of reducing the sentence passed  by  the  trialcourt  and  substituting in its place the  reduced  sentenceadjudged  by  the  appellate  or  revisional  court.	Thisdistinction  is	 well brought out in the  following  passagefrom  Weater's	"  Constitutional  Law"	 on  the  effect  ofreprieves  and pardons vis-a-vis the judgment passed by	 thecourt imposing punishment, at p. 176, para 134:-" A reprieve is a temporary suspension of the18138punishment fixed by law.  A pardon is the remission of	suchpunishment.   Both are the exercise of	executive  functionsand  should be distinguished from the exercise	of  judicialpower over sentences.	 The judicial power and the executivepower over sentences are readily distinguishable,'  observedJustice	 Sutherland,  1 To render a judgment is	 a  judicialfunction.  To carry the judgment into effect is an executivefunction.  To out short a sentence by an act of clemency  isan   exercise	of  executive  power  which   abridges	 theenforcement  of	 the  judgment but does	 not  alter  it	 quajudgment'."Though, therefore, the effect of an order of remission is towipe out that part of the sentence of imprisonment which hasnot  been  served  out and thus in practice  to	 reduce	 thesentence  to the period already undergone, in law the  orderof remission merely means that the rest of the sentence neednot  be	 undergone, leaving the order of conviction  by	 thecourt and the sentence passed by it untouched.	In this viewof  the matter the order of remission passed, in  this	casethough	it had the effect that the appellant was re.  leasedfrom  jail before he had served the full sentence  of  threeyears'	imprisonment  and  had actually	 served	 only  aboutsixteen months' imprisonment, did not in any way affect	 theorder  of conviction and sentence passed by the court  whichremained as it was.  Therefore the terms of s. 7(b) would besatisfied  in  the present case and the	 appellant  being  aperson	convicted  and sentenced to  three  years'  rigorousimprisonment  would be disqualified, as five years  had	 notpassed since his release and as the Election Commission	 hadnot removed his disqualification.We may now refer to a number of cases on which reliance	 hasbeen  placed  on  behalf of  the  appellant.   In  VenkateshYeshwant  Deshpande  v. Emperor (1), Bose, J.  (as  he	thenwas), observed as follows at p. 530:-"  The	effect of an order of remission is to wipe  out	 theremitted  portion of the sentence altogether and not  merelyto suspend its operation; suspension(1)  A.I.R. 1938 Nag. 513.139is  separately	provided  for.	In fact, in the	 case  of  apardon	in  England  statutory	and  other  disqualificationfollowing  upon conviction are removed and the pardoned	 manis  enabled  to maintain an action against  any	 person	 whoafterwards  defames him in respect of the offence for  whichhe  was convicted.  That may not apply in full here but	 theeffect of an order of remission is certainly to entitle	 theprisoner to his freedom on a certain date."It  is urged that if the effect of an order of remission  isto wipe out the remitted portion of the sentence  altogetherit means that the sentence is reduced to the period  alreadyundergone and the order of remission has the same effect  asan  order of an appellate or revisional court  reducing	 thesentence  to  the  period  already  undergone.	 That  case,however,  dealt with a different point	altogether,  namely,whether	 a  remission having been granted and  having  takeneffect	it  could be cancelled thereafter.  It was  in	thatcontext	 that  these observations were made.  Even  so,	 thelearned	 judge	was careful to point out that  there  was  adifference  between a pardon and a remission and the  effectof  an order of remission is to entitle the prisoner to	 hisfreedom	 on a certain date.  That case is no  authority	 forthe view that the order of remission amounts to changing thesentence  passed  by  a	 competent  court  and	substitutingtherefor  the sentence of imprisonment already undergone  upto the date of release following the order of remission.Reference  was	also made to a number of election  cases  inwhich  the  view  which	 has been urged	 on  behalf  of	 theappellant  seems to have been taken.  We may refer  to	onlyone  of	 them, namely, Ganda Singh v.  Sampuran	 Singh	(1),which has specifically dealt with this point.  In that	casean  order  was	passed by the  Maharaja	 of  Nabha  grantingamnesty	 to  all political prisoners detained  or  convictedunder  the  Punjab Public Safety Act, 1947,  as	 applied  toNabha  State, and releasing them unconditionally.  The	sameorder  also  provided  for grant  of  remission	 to  personsconvicted for offences other than political offences on(1) (1953) 3 E.L.R. 17.140a certain scale.  The successful candidate in that case	 wassentenced  to  more than two  years'  rigorous	imprisonmentunder  the  Punjab Public Safety Act, as  applied  to  NabhaState, and was thus a political prisoner.  He was  thereforereleased  before he had served two years imprisonment.	 Themain  plank of the election petition in that case  was	thatthe  successful candidate was disqualified under s. 7(b)  ofthe  Act  in  view of his conviction and  sentence  and	 theelection   tribunal  held  that	 remission   by	  government(executive authority) has the same effect as an order passedby a court of law in appeal or on revision and that under s.7 of the Act the court has to look to the amount of sentenceimposed	 on a person and it made no difference	whether	 thesentence  was  reduced	by a court of law on  appeal  or  byrevision or by the powers of the government reserved for  itunder  s.  401 of the Code of Criminal	Procedure,  as,	 theeffect	in both cases was the same.  We are of opinion	thatthis view is incorrect, though perhaps on the facts of	thatcase  the order of the tribunal was right for it seems	thatpolitical  prisoners had been granted a pardon by the  Rulerof  Nabha and not a mere remission under s. 401 of the	Codeof  Criminal Procedure.	 We cannot agree that  remission  bygovernment has the same effect as an order passed by a courtof  law in appeal or on revision.  It is true that under  s.7(b) of the Act one has to look at the sentence imposed; butit  must  be a sentence imposed by a court.  Now  where	 thesentence  imposed  by  a trial court is	 varied	 by  way  ofreduction  by the appellate or revisional court,  the  finalsentence  is again imposed by a court; but where a  sentenceimposed	 by a court is remitted in part under s. 401 of	 theCode of Criminal Procedure that has not the effect in law ofreducing the sentence imposed by the court, though in effectthe  result  may be that the convicted person  suffers	lessimprisonment  than that imposed by the court.  The order  ofremission  affects the execution of the sentence imposed  bythe  court but does not affect the sentence as	such,  whichremains what it was in spite of the order of remission.	  Itis also well to remember that141s.   7(b) speaks of the conviction and sentence passed by  acourt	of  law;  it  does  not	 speak	of  the	 period	  ofimprisonment actually suffered by the convicted person.	 Theother election cases to which our attention was drawn by thelearned	 counsel for the appellant are similar and they	 areall  in	 our opinion wrongly decided.  We are  therefore  ofopinion	 that the High Court was right in the view that	 thenomination paper of the appellant was properly rejected.The next contention on behalf of the appellants is that boththe High Court and the tribunal were wrong in holding that acorrupt	 practice  within the meaning of s.  100(1)(b)	readwith  s. 123(5) had not been proved in this case.  The	caseof   the   appellant  was  that	 voters	 were	carried	  bymechanically  propelled	 vehicles to the polling  booths  byBirendra Kumar Nath who was in-charge of the  electioneeringcampaign on behalf of the Congress Party and Bholaram Sarkarwho  was  president  of the Primary  Congress  Committee  ofDhupdhara.   The successful candidates were both  contestingthe election as nominees of the Congress Party and thereforethese  two  persons  who carried  electors  in	mechanicallypropelled vehicles to the polling booths did so as agents ofthe successful candidates and with their consent.  The	HighCourt  as  well as the election tribunal  hold	that  thoughBirendra  Kumar Nath and Bholaram Sarkar might be deemed  tobe  the agents of the successful candidates for purposes  ofthe election and though the hiring of mechanically propelledvehicles by the agents for conveyance of electors to pollingbooths	had  been proved, there was no proof that  this	 wasdone with the consent, express or implied, of the successfulcandidates.   The  High	 Court	pointed	 out  that  consent,express	 or  implied, of the candidates	 was  necessary	 forpurposes  of s. 100(1) (b) and was of the view that  on	 thefacts proved in this case such consent could not be inferredand  the  circumstances	 did not  convincingly	lead  to  aninference   that  the  corrupt	practice  in  question	 wascommitted  with the knowledge and consent of the  successfulcandidates.  In view of this concurrent finding of the	HighCourt and the142tribunal  on  this  question,  namely,	whether	 there	 wasconsent, express or implied, of the successful candidates tothe  commission	 of  this corrupt practice,  it	 is  in	 ouropinion idle for the appellant now to contend that there wasconsent	 express  or implied, as required by  s.  100(1)(b).The  inference	whether there was consent or  not  from	 thefacts and circumstances proved is still an inference of factfrom other facts and circumstances and cannot be a  questionof  law	 as  urged by learned  counsel	for  the  appellant.Reference in this connection may be made to Meenakshi Mills,Madurai v. The Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras(1),  whereit  was	 held  that a finding of fact, even when  it  is  aninference  from	 other	facts found on evidence,  is  not  aquestion of law and that such an inference can be a questionof  law	 only when the point for determination	is  a  mixedquestion  of  law and fact.  In the present  case  the	onlyquestion is whether the corrupt practice was committed	withthe  consent of the candidates, whether express or  implied,and  the  question  whether such consent was  given  in	 thecircumstances  of this case is a question of fact and not  amixed question of law and fact and therefore the finding  ofthe  High  Court as well as the tribunal that there  was  noconsent,   either  express  or	implied,  in  our   opinion,concludes  the	matter.	  There is no force  in	 this  pointeither.The  appeal  therefore fails and is  hereby  dismissed	withcosts.		       Appeal dismissed.(1) [1956] S.C.R. 691.143
