The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyKAPUR,	J.-These three appeals are brought by special  leaveagainst	 the judgment and order of the High Court of  Keralaand  arise out of a common  judgment of that court given  inthree Agricultural Income-tax References Nos. 15, 18 and  19of 1955.  In the first reference the question raised was:	      "Whether under the Travancore-Cochin  Agricul-	      tural Income Tax Act, 1950 in calculating	 the	      assessable  agricultural	income of  a  rubber	      estate  already  planted and  containing	both	      mature yielding rubber trees and also immature	      rubber   plants  which  have  not	 come	into	      bearing, the annual expenses incurred for	 the	      upkeep and maintenance of such rubber  plants,	      are  not a permissible deduction, and  if	 so,	      whether the sum of  Rs. 42,660-4-1 expended by	      the  assessee in the relevant accounting	year	      1952, under this head may be deducted."	      and  in  the other two the  question  referred	      was:	      281	      "Whether the expenses incurred for the mainte-	      nance  and  upkeep of  immature  rubber  trees	      constitute a permissible deduction within	 the	      meaning of s. 5(j) of Act XXII of 1950?"In  all	 the references the questions were answered  in	 thenegative and against the appellant.The appeals relate to three accounting years 1950, 1951	 and1952  (assessment years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54).	 Theappellants have rubber plantations and in  the	accountingyear 1950, corresponding to the assessment year 1951-52, theappellants had under cultivation 3558-84 acres out of  which334-64 acres had immature rubber trees growing and the	resti.e.  3224-20  acres  mature  rubber  yielding	trees  undercultivation.   In that year a sum of Rs.  19,056-0-9,  whichwas  expended  for the upkeep and  maintenance	of  immatureportion	 of  the  rubber  plantation,  was  allowed  by	 theAgricultural Income tax Tribunal and at the instance of	 therespondent  a reference was made to the High Court under  s.60(1) of the Agricultural Income tax Act (Act XXII of  1950)hereinafter  termed the 'Act' and that was reference No.  18of 1955.During	the  accounting	 year  1951  corresponding  to	 theassessment year 1952-53 the appellant had under cultivation.a total area of 3426,55 acres of which 3091.91acres weremature rubber yielding trees and 334.64 acres  had  immaturerubber trees.  In that year a sum of Rs. 59,271.9-5 was	 theexpenditure  incurred  for  the upkeep	and  maintenance  ofimmature portion of the rubber estate.	That sum was allowedby the Agricultural Income-tax Tribunal and at the  instanceof the respondent a reference was made under s. 60(1) of theAct to the High Court and that was reference No. 19 of 1955.In  Agricultural Income-tax Reference No. 15 of	 1955  whichrelated	 to,  accounting year 1952 and the  assessment	year1953-54, the area under cultivation was 3453,65 out of which2967,91	 acres had mature rubber yielding trees	 and  485,74acres  had immature rubber growing trees.  In that year	 theamount expended on the maintenance and tending of the  imma-ture rubber trees was Rs. 42,660,4-1.  In that case,36282however,  the Agricultural Income tax Tribunal rejected	 theappellant's  claim and disallowed the expenditure.   At	 theinstance  of  the appellant a case was stated  to  the	HighCourt  under  s. 60(1) of the Act and was  answered  in	 thenegative  and against the  appellant. In all the  cases	 theassessee company is the appellant and the main question	 fordecision  is whether the amount expended for the upkeep	 andmaintenance  of the immature, rubber trees is a	 permissiblededuction under s. 5(j) of the Act.The charging section under the Act is s. 3 and s. 5  relatesto computation of agricultural income.	Itprovides:-	      S.5  "The agricultural income of a  person	      shall  be computed after making the  following	      deductions, namely:-	      expenditure  (not	 being	in  the	 nature	  of	      capital  expenditure or personal	expenses  of	      the assessee) laid out or expended wholly	 and	      exclusively  for the purpose of  deriving	 the	      agricultural income;".	      In regard to this income the High Court held:	      "We  find	 it  impossible	 to  say  that	 the	      'amounts	spent on the upkeep and	 maintenance	      of the immature rubber plants were laid out or	      expended	"for  the purpose  of  deriving	 the	      agricultural income", much less that they were	      laid  out or expended "wholly and	 exclusively	      for that purpose".	      "The agricultural income", in the context, can	      only mean the agricultural income obtained  in	      the  accounting  year concerned  and  not	 the	      agricultural income of any other period."In our opinion the High Court has taken an erroneous view ofthe   relevant	provision.   It	 is  not  denied  that	 theexpenditure   claimed	as  a  deduction  was	wholly	 andexclusively laid out for the purpose of deriving income	 butthe  use of the definite article "the"	before	agriculturalincome	has  given  rise  to  the  interpretation  that	 thededuction is to be from the income of the year in which	 thetrees on which the amount claimed283was  expended bore any income.	In a somewhat  similar	caseVallambrosa Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Farmer (1) the expenditure ofthe  kind  now claimed was allowed under  the  correspondingprovision  of the English Income-tax Act.  In that  case  arubber	company	 had  an  estate in which  in  the  year  ofassessment only 1/7 produced rubber and the other 6/7 was inprocess of cultivation for the production of rubber.  It maybe  added  that rubber trees do not yield any  rubber  untilthey  are  about  six years old.  The  expenditure  for	 thesuperintendence,  weeding  etc. incurred by the	 company  inrespect of the whole estate including the nonbearing  rubberestate	was  allowed on the ground that in arriving  at	 theassessable  profits the assessee was entitled to deduct	 theexpenditure  for superintendence, weeding etc. on the  wholeestate	and not only on the 1/7 of such	 expenditure.	LordPresident said at page 534:	      "Well that is for the case quite correct,	 but	      it  must be taken, as you must always  take  a	      Judge's dicta, secundum materiam subjectum  of	      the case that is decided.	 But to say that the	      expression of Lord Esher's lays down that	 you	      must  take each year absolutely by itself	 and	      allow no expense except the expense which	 can	      be put against the profit which is reaped	 for	      the  year is in my judgment to press  it	much	      further than it will go."Counsel	 for the respondent relied upon a judgment  of	thisCourt in Assam Bengal Cement Co. Ltd. v. The Commissioner ofIncome-tax, West Bengal (2) and particularly on a passage atpage 983 where Bhagwati J. observed:	      "The  distinction	 was thus made	between	 the	      acquisition of an income-earning asset and the	      process	of  the	 earning  of   the   income.	      Expenditure  in the acquisition of that  asset	      was capital expenditure and expenditure in the	      process  of  the earning of  the	profits	 was	      revenue expenditure."But  that case has no relevancy to the facts of the  presentcase nor has that passage any applicability to the facts  ofthe present case.  The question there was(1) (1910) 5 T.C. 529.(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 972.284whether	 certain  payments  made  were	by  way	 of  capitalexpenditure or revenue expenditure.  The assessee acquired alease  from Government for twenty years and in	addition  topaying the rent and royalties for the lease the assessee hadto pay two further sums as 'protection fees' under the termsof   the  lease.   Those  sums	were  held  to	be   capitalexpenditure   inasmuch	as  they  were	incurred   for	 theacquisition  of an asset or an advantage of enduring  natureand were no part of the working or operational expenses	 forcarrying on the business of the assessee.In  our opinion the amount expended on the  superintendence,weeding	 etc. of the whole estate should have  been  allowedagainst the profits earned and it is no answer to the  claimfor  a	deduction that part of those  expenses	produced  noreturn in that year because all the trees were not  yieldingrubber in thatyear.We  therefore allow these appeals, set aside  the  judgmentsand  orders  of the High Court and answer the  questions  infavour	of  the	 appellant in  all  the	 three	agriculturalIncome-tax References.	The appellant will have its costs inthis  Court  and the High Court.  One hearing  fee  in	thisCourt.Appeals allowed.		 _________________285
