The respondents had been enrolled as  advocatesof  the Lahore High Court on various dates between 1933	 and1940,  and while respondents 2, 4 and 5 had their  names  onthe  roll  of advocates of the Punjab High  Court  and	werepractising  as advocates at the time they were appointed  asDistrict  Judges in 1950 and 1952, respondents 3 and  6	 didnot  have their names factually on the roll when  they	wereappointed as District judges in 1957 and 1958.	Respondent 6had his name so enrolled after his appointment.Under  a notification dated September 28, 1948, ss. 3 to  16of the Bar Councils Act, 1926, came into force in respect ofthe East Punjab High Court, by virtue of which a Bar Councilwas  constituted and a roll of advocates had to be  preparedand maintained by the High Court in accordance with s. 8  ofthe  Act.   The	 proviso to sub-s. (2) of S. 8	of  the	 Actrequired them to deposit a fee of Rs. 10 payable to the	 BarCouncil.   The	appellant's contention was that	 after'	 thepartition of the country, which led to the establishment  ofa  separate High Court for the province of East	 Punjab	 thePunjab	High Court was established only on August  15  1947,under  the  High  Courts (Punjab) Order, 1947,	and  as	 therespondents did not have seven years' standing as  advocateswith  reference	 to their right of practice in	a  court  inIndia after that date, they did not fulfil the	requirementsof  Art. 233(2) When they were appointed as District  Judgesand,  therefore,  their appointments  were  constitutionallyinvalid.  The question was whether the period of seven yearsreferred to in Art. 233(2) must be counted as the875standing  of the advocate or pleader with reference  to	 hisright  of practice in a court in the territory of  India  asdefined	 in Art.  of the Constitution, or whether any  rightof  practice in a court Rat, which was in India	 before	 thepartition of the country in 1947 but which was not in  Indiasince partition, could also be taken into consideration	 forthe purpose of counting the period of seven years.Held, that under cl. (6) of the High Courts (Punjab)  Order,1947,  read with s. 8(3) of the Bar Councils Act,  1926,  anadvocate of the Punjab High Court was entitled to count	 theperiod	of  his	 practice  in  the  Lahore  High  Court	 fordetermining  his  standing  at	the  Bar.   Accordingly	  asrespondents  2,	 4 and 5 continued to be  advocates  of	 thePunjab	High  Court  when they were  appointed	as  Districtjudges	and had a standing of more than seven years when  soappointed, they fulfilled the requirements of Art. 233(2) ofthe Constitution.Held, further, that the effect of cl. (6) of the High Courts(Punjab)  Order,  1947, and s. 8(2)(a) of the  Bar  CouncilsAct,  1926, was that from August 15, 1947, to September	 28,1948,  advocates who had been enrolled as advocates  of	 theLahore	High Court were recognised as advocates entitled  topractice  in the Punjab High Court, and after September	 28,1948,  they automatically came on the roll of  advocates  ofthe Punjab High Court, but had to pay a fee of Rs. 10 to theBar Council.  Consequently, respondents 3 and 6 who did	 notcease to be advocates at any time or stage after August	 15,1947,  continued  to be advocates of the Punjab	 High  Courttill  they  were appointed as District judges  and  had	 thenecessary standing of seven years to be eligible under	Art.233(2) of the Constitution.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION.

DAS, J.-This is an appeal by special  from  anorder of the High Court of Punjab dated September 21,  1959,by  which  it  summarily dismissed&  petition  made  by	 thepresent	 appellant  under Art. 226 of the  Constitution	 forcertain relief,% in respect of five persons, two of whom arenow  working as Additional Judges of the Punjab High  Court,the third as Officiating Judge of the same Court, the fourthas  District  and Sessions Judge, Delhi, and  the  fifth  asRegistrar, Punjab High Court, Chandigarh.  Shorn of  detailswhich are not material, the case of the appellant was and isthat  the  aforesaid five persons, now respondents  2  to  6before	us, were not qualified to be appointed	as  DistrictJudges	under Art. 233 of the Constitution at the time	whenthey  were  so	appointed  by  the  State  Government,	 nowrespondent 1 before us, and, therefore, their appointment assuch was constitutionally invalid; and the appellant claimedby  way	 of his main relief that a writ in the nature  of  awrit  of quo warranto should issue "ousting them from  theiroffice	and  restraining them from  exercising	the  powers,duties and functions of the posts they are holding and	fromclaiming  any rights, privileges or emoluments	attached  totheir office." Certain other subsidiary or ancillary reliefswere,  also claimed details whereof need not now be  stated,We have stated that the petition was summarily dismissed  bythe High Court.	 An application for a certificate of fitnesshaving failed in the High Court, the appellant asked for andobtained special leave from this Court. on August 19, 1960.The  appeal  has  been contested by  the  State	 of  Punjab,respondent  1,	and the other respondents of  whom  ShamsherBahadur, Harbans Singh and Gurdev Singh are Justices of	 thePunjab High Court, Hans Raj Khanna is District and  SessionsJudge, Delhi,877and  P.	 R. Sawhney is Registrar of the High  Court.   Theserespondents  have  filed separate affidavits in	 reply,	 andsome  of  them have been separately represented	 and  heard.The  Advocate-General of Punjab has appeared  and  contestedthe appeal on behalf of respondent 1. The Union of India wasoriginally  a party-respondent to the petition	inasmuch  asthe appellant had initially impugned the appointment of	 twoof  the respondents as High Court Judges; this	relief	was,however,  given up during the pendency of the special  leavepetition  and on an application made by the  appellant,	 thename of the Union of India was struck off by an order  datedMarch 18, 1960, leaving the matter in dispute limited to thequestion  of  the  validity of the  initial  appointment  ofrespondents  2	to 6 as District Judges	 only.	 Later,	 theUnion  of  India  made an application to  intervene  in	 theappeal	and in view of the circumstance that a	question  ofthe interpretation of Art. 233 of Constitution arises in theappeal,	 we  have  allowed the	application  and  heard	 thelearned Additional Solicitor-General, even though the  Unionof  India did not appear at an earlier stage to contest	 theapplication which the appellant had made, to expunge it fromthe category of respondents.The  other persons B. D. Pathak and Om Dutt Sharma had	alsofiled  a writ petition in the Punjab High Court	 challengingthe  legality  of the appointment of P. R. Sawhney  who,  itappears,  had  acquitted certain persons in  three  criminalappeals	 decided by him on January 22, 1959,  as  AdditionalDistrict  and Sessions Judge, Delhi, from the decision of  amagistrate  of Delhi in a case in which B. D. Pathak and  OmDutt Sharma said that they had been assaulted by the personsaccused in the case.  They filed three revision petitions inrespect of the orders passed, which are pending in the	HighCourt.	 In view of these circumstances they have also	beenallowed	 to intervene in the present appeal in so far as  itrelates	 to  the appointment of P. R. Sawhney, and  we	haveheard learned Counsel on their behalf.878On  behalf of the respondents who are no longer	 working  asDistrict  Judges a preliminary objection has been  taken  tothe  maintainability of the appeal.  It has  been  contendedthat  the  appeal is now limited to the	 question  of  theirappointment  as	 District Judges and as they are  no  longerholding	 the  office of District Judge, the prayer  for	 theissue of a writ of quo warranto in respect of that office isno  longer maintainable.  On behalf of the appellant it	 hasbeen  submitted	 in reply that respondents 2 to	 4  are	 notpermanent Judges of the High Court so that if and when	theyrevert,	 they  must go back to their  substantive  posts  ofDistrict  Judges; therefore, the question whether they	werevalidly appointed to their substantive posts is a live issueand the appellant is entitled to ask this Court to pronounceon  that issue.	 The learned Advocate-General has  submittedthat the State is anxious to have the decision of this Courton  the legality of the appointments made in order to  avoidfuture	trouble	 and the State does not wish  to  raise	 anypreliminary  objection to the determination of the  questionin issue.  On a careful consideration of the matter, we havecome  to the conclusion that the preliminary objection	mustbe  overruled  and in the circumstances of this	 case,	thisCourt	must  decide  on  the  legality	 of   the   impugnedappointments.It   would   facilitate	 appreciation  of  the	 points	  incontroversy  if	 we  state  first,  in	broad  outline,	 thecircumstances in which respondents 2 to 6 were appointed  asDistrict Judges.(1)..Respondent	 2 Shamshere Bahadur, J.) was called to	 theBar  in England on January 26, 1933, by the  Middle  Temple.He  was enrolled as an Advocate of the Lahore High Court  onMay  15,  1933,	 and practised as such in  that	 Court.	  OnFebruary  9,  1949, he was enrolled as an  Advocate  of	 theFederal	 Court of India.  On and after August 15,  1947,  hepractised as an Advocate of the East Punjab High Court	tillhe  was	 appointed as District and Sessions Judge  on  March20,1950.   Then he functioned as Legal Remembrancer  of	 theState  Government from December 1953 to May 1959,  when,  hewas  appointed	as an Additional Judge of  the	Punjab	HighCourt.879(2)..Respondent 3 (Harbans Singh, J.) was also called to theBar  and  then enrolled as an Advocate	of  the	 Lahore HighCourt on March 5, 1937.	 He worked as an Additional Districtand  Sessions  Judge, s Ferozepore, from July 2, 1947  ,  toFebruary  22, 1948.  He then returned to practice  at  Simlafor  a short while.  On March 15, 1948, he worked as  DeputyCustodian, Evacuee Property, till April 17, 1950.  On  April18,  1950, he was appointed as District and  Sessions  Judgeand  on August 11, 1958, he was appointed as  an  AdditionalJudge of the Punjab High Court.(3)..Respondent	 4  (Gurdev  Singh, J.) was  enrolled  as  aPleader	 of the Lahore High Court on October 25,  1934,	 andthen as an Advocate of the said Court on December 20,  1938.He was enrolled as an Advocate of the Federal Court of Indiaon  May 29, 1948, and was continuously in practice  till  hewas appointed as District and Sessions Judge on February  2.1952.  On July 11, 1960, he was appointed to officiate as  aJudge of the Punjab High Court.(4)..Respondent	 5  (Hans  Raj Khanna)	was  enrolled  as  aPleader of the Lahore High Court on July 17, 1934, and	thenenrolled  as an Advocate of the said Court on  December	 20,1940.	He started his practice as a lawyer at Amritsar	 andhe  continued  his practice there till	his  appointment  asDistrict and Sessions Judge.  His name was borne on the Rollof Advocates prepared by the East Punjab High Court when  hewas appointed as District and Sessions Judge on February..1,1952.(5)..Respondent 6 (P.  R. Sawhney) was called to the Bar   onNovember  17, 1930, and was enrolled as an Advocate  of	 theLahore	High  Court on March 10, 1931.	After  partition  heshifted to Delhi and worked for sometime as Legal Adviser tothe Custodian, Evacuee Property, Delhi.	 Then lie  practisedfor  sometime at Delhi; he then accepted service  under	 theMinistry of Rehabilitation as an Officer on Special Duty andAdministrator,	Rajpura	 Township.  On March  30,  1949,  hebecame the chairman, Jullundur Improvement Trust.  On May 6,1949,  he  got	his  licence  to  practise  as	an  Advocatesuspended.  On880April  6,  1957, he was appointed as District  and  SessionsJudge.It would thus appear that of the five respondents  mentionedabove,	three, namely, Shamshere Bahadur, Gurudev Singh	 andHans Raj Khanna had their names on the Roll of Advocates  ofthe Punjab High Court before they were appointed as DistrictJudges.	  In other words, they were practising as  Advocatesat  the time they were so appointed.  Two of  them,  HarbansSingh and P. R. Sawhney, did not have their names  factuallyon the Roll when they were appointed as District Judges.  P.R.  Sawhney it appears, had his name so enrolled on  October20, 1959, that is, after his appointment as District  Judge.We  are inviting attention to this distinction	amongst	 therespondents at this stage. because as will appear later thisdistinction  has some bearing on one of the  arguments	madebefore us on behalf of the appellant.We  proceed  now to a consideration of the  main  contentionurged  on  behalf  of.	the  appellant,	 namely,  that	 theappointment  of	 respondents 2 to 6 as District	 Judges	 wasmade in contravention of the provisions of. Art. 233 of	 theConstitution.  It is convenient to read here Art. 233 of theConstitution:"Art.  233(1).	 Appointments  of persons  to  be,  and	 theposting and promotion of, district judges in any State shallbe  made by the Governor of the State in  consultation	withthe  High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to	suchState.(2)..A person not already in the service of the Union or  ofthe State shall only be eligible to be appointed a  districtjudge  if  he  has been for not less  than  seven  years  anadvocate or, a pleader and is recommended by the High  Courtfor appointment."Now,  the argument of learned Counsel for the appellant	 hasranged	over a wide field; but the point for decision  is  anarrow	one  and  depends  on whether  respondents  2  to  6fulfilled  the	requirements of el. (2) of Art. 233  of	 theConstitution when they were appointed as District Judges  byrespondent  1.	That  clause lays down	that  a	 person	 notalready	 in the service of the Union or of the	State  shallonly be eligible to be881appointed  a district judge if (1) he has been for not	lessthan  seven  years  an	advocate or a  pleader	and  (2)  isrecommended  by the High Court for appointment.	 As  to	 thesecond	 requirement  no  question  arises   here,   becauseadmittedly  respondents 2 to 6 were recommended by the	HighCourt before their appointment.	 The dispute is with  regardto the first requirement.  Learned Counsel for the appellanthas  contended	that respondents 2 to 6 did not	 fulfil	 therequirement  of	 having been " seven years  an	advocate  orpleader"  and  has  put	 his  argument	in  support  of	 hiscontention in the following way.  Firstly, he has  submittedthat  the expression "advocate or pleader" is an  expressionof  legal  import and must be given its	 generally  acceptedmeaning	 at the time the Constitution was adopted; and	thatexpression according to learned Counsel means an advocate orpleader entitled to appear and plead for another in a  Courtin  India, but does not include an advocate or pleader of  aforeign	 Court;	 for this submission he has  relied  on	 thedefinition  of the expression "legal practitioners"  in	 theLegal Practitioners Act, 1879 (XVIII of 1879); of  "pleader"in  the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (Act V of 1908);  and  of"advocate" in the Bar Councils Act, 1926 (XXXVIII of  1926).Secondly, he has submitted that by reason of the use of	 thepresent perfect tense "has been" in cl. (2) of Art. 233, therules  of  grammar  require that  the  person  eligible	 forappointment  must not only have been an advocate or  pleaderbefore but must be an advocate or pleader at the time he  isappointed to the office of District Judge.  Thirdly, he	 hassubmitted that the period of seven years referred to in	 theclause	must be counted as the standing of the	advocate  orpleader with reference to his right of practice in s  Court,in  the	 territory  of India as defined in Art.	  1  of	 theConstitution;  in  other words, any right of practice  in  aCourt which was in India before the partition of the countryin 1947 but which is not in India since partition, cannot betaken  into  consideration for the purpose of  counting	 theperiod of seven years.We shall presently consider these submissions in so882far as they bear on the problem before us.  But before	  wedo  so,	 it is necessary to explain the changes	 which	tookplace  after the partition of the country and led     to theestablishment of a High Court of Judicature for the provinceof  East  Punjab (now called the Punjab High Court  for	 theState of Punjab) and how those changes affected the positionof  advocates or pleaders who had the right to	practice  inthe Lahore High Court of undivided Punjab.  The IndependenceAct, 1947, brought into existence two independent Dominions-India  and  Pakistan-and  s. 9 thereof	gave  the  Governor-General	 power	to make orders inter alia for  bringing	 theprovisions of the Act into effective operation.	 In exerciseof  that  power the Governor-General made  the	High  Courts(Punjab)   Order,  1947,  which	 established  as  from	 theappointed  day (August 15, 1947) a High Court of  Judicaturefor the then Province of East Punjab.  Clause 6 of the Orderis important and must be quoted in full:"6(1)  The  High Court of East Punjab shall  have  the	likepowers	 to  approve,  admit,  enrol,  remove  and   suspendadvocates,  vakils  and attorneys, and to  make	 rules	withrespect to advocates, vakils and attorneys as are, under thelaw   in  force	 immediately  before  the   appointed	day,exercisable by the High Court at Lahore. (2) The right of audience in the High Court of East  Punjabshall  be regulated in accordance with the  like  principlesas, immediately before the appointed day, are in force	withrespect	 to  the  right of audience in	the  High  Court  atLahore:Provided  that, subject to any rule made or direction  givenby  the	 High Court of East Punjab in the  exercise  of	 thepowers	 conferred   by	 this  Article,	 any   person	who,immediately before the appointed day, is an advocate,  vakilor attorney entitled to practise in the High Court at Lahoreshall  be  recognised  as an  advocate,	 vakil	or  attorneyentitled to practise in the High Court of East Punjab."It  is	also necessary to notice cl. 14 of the	Order  whichstates	inter alia that "the provisions of this Order  shallhave effect subject to any provision made on or883after  the appointed day with respect to...............	 theHigh  Court  of East Punjab by any  legislature	 or  other..authority  having power to make such provision." The  pointswhich we must emphasise here are (1) that under el. 6(2) theseniority  of  advocates in the new High Court as  to  theirright  of audience was to be regulated by the  principle  inforce  in-the  former  High Court and  (2)  that  under	 theproviso to cl. 6 any person who before August 15, 1947,	 wasan  advocate entitled to practise in the Lahore	 High  Courtwas  recognised as an advocate entitled to practise  in	 theHigh  Court  of	 East Punjab, subject to any  rule  made  ordirection  given by the High Court or any provision made  bythe legislature or other authority having power to make suchprovision.  The Bar Councils Act, 1926, except for ss. 1, 2,17,18  and 19 did not then apply to the High Court  of	EastPunjab.	  By  a notification dated September 28,  1948,	 theGovernor of East Punjab directed that the provisions of	 ss.3 to 16 of the said Act shall come into force in respect  ofthe  East  Punjab  High Court with effect  from	 that  date.Section	 3 of the Act says that for every High Court  a	 BarCouncil	 shall be constituted in the manner provided by	 theprovisions  of the Act.	 Section 8 of the Act says  (We	 arereading such portion only as is relevant for our purpose):-"S. 8(1) No person shall be entitled as of right to practisein any High Court, unless his name is entered in the roll ofthe advocates of the High Court maintained under this Act:Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to anyattorney of the High Court.:(2)..The  High	Court shall prepare and maintain a  roll  ofadvocates  of the High Court in which shall be	entered	 thenames of-(a)..all persons who were, as advocates, vakils or pleaders,entitled  as  of  right	 to  practise  in  the	High   Courtimmediately before the date on which this section comes intoforce in respect thereof, and(b)..all  other	 persons  who  have  been  admitted  to	  beadvocates of the High Court under this Act:Provided that  such persons shall have paid in884respect	 of  enrolment the stamp duty,	if  any,  chargeableunder the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, and a fee, payable to	 theBar Council, which shall be ten rupees in the	  case	  ofthe  persons referred to in clause (a), and in	other  casessuch amount as may be prescribed.(3)  Entries  in  the roll shall be made  in  the  order  ofseniority and such seniority shall be determined as follows,namely:-(a)..all  such persons as are referred to in clause  (a)  ofsub-section (2) shall be entered first in the order in whichthey  were  respectively  entitled  to	seniority  inter  seimmediately before the date on which this section comes intoforce in respect of the High Court; and(b)..the  seniority  of any other person admitted to  be  anadvocate  of the High Court under this Act after  that	dateshall  be determined by the date of his admission or, if  heis a barrister, by the date of his admission or the date  onwhich he was called to the Bar, whichever date is earlier:Provided that, for the purposes of clause (b), the seniorityof  a person who before his admission to be an advocate	 wasentitled as of right to practise in another High Court shallbe determined by the date on which he became so entitled.(4)..The  respective rights of pre-audience of advocates  ofthe High Court shall be determined by seniority."It is not very clear from the record before us when the	 BarCouncil was actually constituted for the Punjab High  Court,but  it was stated at the Bar that the first  election	tookplace in 1950.	But on January 13, 1949, the High Court madecertain	 rules under ss. 6 and 12 of the Act.  Rule 2(1)  oftile said rules was in these terms:"Rule  2(1).   The Registrar shall  classify  the  advocatesentered	 in the roll prepared under section  8,	 sub-section(2), of the Indian Councils Act as follows:-(a)..those who have or who on or before the date of electionof  the	 members of the Bar Council of the High	 Court	willhave, for not less than 10 years, been entitled as of  rightto practise in the High Court;885(b)..those  who	 other than those mentioned in	clause	(a),are,or who on or before the: date of the election of membersof the Bar Council of the High Court may become entitled  topractise in the High Court."We  have,  therefore two distinct periods to keep  in  mind.The.first  period  in between August 15,1947,  to  September27,1948,when  the main provisions of the Bar  Councils	Act,1926, were not in. force for  the Punjab High Court  and theright  of  advocates  was regulated by	the,  High   Courts,(punjab) Order, 1947.  The second period,was from  September28,  1948 when the main provisions. of the Bar Councils	 Actwore  brought into force, rules were made thereunder, a	 BarCouncil was constituted,and a roll of Advocates was preparedand maintained in accordance with a. 8 of the said Act.	  Itwas  in	 this second period that the Constitution  of  Indiacame into force on January 26, 1950.This  is  the background against which we have	to  considerthe, argument of learned Counsel for the appellant., Even ifwe  assume without finally pronouncing on their	 correctnessthat learned Counsel is right in his first two	submissions,viz., that the word " advocate" in cl. (2) of Art. 233 moansan  advocate of a Court in India and the appointee  must  besuch  an  advocate  at	the  time  of  his  appointment,  noobjection on those grounds can be raised to the	 appointmentof  three of the respondents who were factually on the	rollof Advocates of the Punjab High Court at. the time of  theirappointment;  because admittedly they were advocates  in.  aCourt in India and continued as such advocates the the datesof  their  appointment.	 The only, question with  regard  tothem is whether they can count. in the period of seven yearstheir period of practice in or under the Lahore High  Court.The answer to this question is clearly furnished by cl. 6(2)of the High, Courts (Punjab) Order, 1947, read with s.	8(3)of the Bar Councils oils, Act, 1926.  That clause lays	downthat  the  right  1 of audience in the High  Court  of	EastPunjab is all be regulated in886accordance  with the principle in force in the	Lahore	HighCourt  immediately before the, appointed day.  The  relevantrule  in  the  Lahore,	High Court-  Rules  laid  down	thatAdvocates who are Barristers shall take precedence inter  seaccording  to the date of,, call to the Bar;  Advocates	 whoare  not'  Barristers,	according to  the  dates  when	theybecame,	 entitled  to practice in a High  Court.   The	sameprinciple  applied  to the East Punjab High Court,'  and  anadvocate  of the Lahore High Court who was recognised as  anadvocate entitled to practise in the new High Court  countedhis  seniority on the strength of his standing in the LahoreHigh  Court.   He  did not lose that  seniority,  which	 waspreserved  by  the  Bar Councils Act, 1926. and	 we  see  noreasons	 why for the purpose of cl. (2) of Art. 233 such  anadvocate should not have the same standing as he has in	 theHigh Court where he is practising.Learned	 Counsel  for  the  appellant  has  also  drawn	 ourattention  to  Explanation 1 to cl (3) of Art. 124,  of	 theConstitution relating to the qualifications for	 appointmentas  a Judge of the Supreme Court and to the  Explanation  tocl.  (2)  of  Art. 217 relating to  the	 qualifications	 forappointment  as a Judge of a High Court, and  has  submittedthat where the Constitution-makers thought it necessary theyspecifically  provided	for counting the period	 in  a	HighCourt which was formerly in India.  Articles 124 and 217 aredifferently worded and refer to an additional  qualificationof citizenship which is not a requirement of Art., 233,	 andwe do not think that el. (2) of Art. 233 can be	 interpretedin  the	 light of Explanations added to Arts. 124  and	217.Article	 233  is a self contained  provision  regarding	 theappointment  of	 District  Judges.  As to a  person  who  isalready	 in  the  serve of the Union or of  the	 State,	 no'special	 qualifications are laid down and under el. (1)	 theGovernor  can appoint such a person as a district  judge  inconsultation  with the relevant High Court.  As to a  personnot already in service, a qualification is laid down in	 el.(2)  and  all  that  is required is that  he  should  be  anadvocate or pleader of seven years' standing.  The887clause	does not say how that standing must be reckoned	 andif an Advocate of the Punjab High Court is entitled to countthe  period  of his practice in the Lahore  High  Court	 fordetermining his standing at the Bar, we see nothing in	Art.233  which  must lead to the exclusion of  that	 period	 fordetermining  his  eligibility for  appointment	as  districtjudge.What will be the result if the interpretation canvassed	 foron  behalf of the appellant is accepted ?  Then,  for  sevenyears  beginning from August 15, 1947, no member of the	 Barof  the Punjab High Court would be eligible for	 appointmentas  district judge a result which has only to be  stated  todemonstrate the weakness of the argument.  We have proceededso  far on the first two submissions of learned Counsel	 forthe  appellant,	 and  on that basis  dealt  with  his  thirdsubmission.  It is perhaps necessary to add that we must notbe understood to have decided that the expression 'has been'must always mean what learned Counsel for the appellant saysit means according to the strict rules of grammar.  'It	 maybe  seriously questioned if an organic Constitution must  beso   narrowly  interpreted,  and  the	learned	  AdditionalSolicitor-General has drawn our attention to other  Articlesof the Constitution like Art. 5(c) where in-the context	 theexpression has a different meaning.  Our attention has	alsobeen  drawn to the decision of the Allahabad High  Court  inMubarak	 Mazdoor  v.  K. K. Banerji (1)	 where	a  differentmeaning	 was given to a similar expression occurring in	 theproviso to sub-s. (3) of s. 86 of the Representation of	 thePeople Act, 1951.  We consider it unnecessary to pursue thismatter further because the respondents.We are now  consider-ing  continued	to be advocates	 of the	 Punjab	 High  Courtwhen  they were appointed as district judges and they had  astanding  of more than seven years when so appointed.	Theywere  clearly eligible for appointment under cl. 2  of	Art.233 of the Constitution.We now turn to the other two respondents (Harbans Singh	 andP. R. Sawhney) whose names were not(1)  A.I.R. 1958 All. 323.888factually   on the roll of Advocates at the time they	wereappointed  as  district judge& What is their  position?	  Weconsider  that they also fulfiled' the requirements of	Art.233  of the Constitution.  Harbans Singh was in	 service  ofthe   State  at	 the  time  of	his  appointment,  and	 Mr.Viswanantha Sastri appearing for him has submitted that ;el.(2) of Art. 233 did not apply.	We consider that even if  weproceed	 on  the  footing  that	 both  these  persons	wererecruited  from	 the  Bar and their appointment	 has  to  betested	by  the requirements of el. (2), we must  hold	thatthey  fulfilled	 those requirements.   They  were  Advocatesenrolled  in  the Lahore High Court; this is  not  disputed.Under  cl. 6 of the High Courts (Punjab) Order,	 1947,	theywere  recognised  as Advocates entitled to practise  in	 thePunjab High Court till the Bar Councils Act, 1926, came intoforce.	Under s. 8 (2)(a) of that Act it was the duty of theHigh  Court to prepare and maintain a roll of  advocates  inwhich  their  names should have been entered on the  day  onwhich  s 8 came into force, that is, on September 28,  1948.The proviso to sub-s. (2) of s. 8 required them to deposit afee  of Rs. 10 payable to the Bar Council.   Obviously	suchpayment	 could	hardly be made before the  Bar	Council	 wasconstituted.   We do not agree with learned Counsel for	 theappellant  and	the interveners (B.  D. Pathak and  Om	DuttSharma) that, the proviso had the effect of taking away	 theright  which these respondents had to come automatically  onthe  roll  of  advocates under s. 8(2)(a) of  the  Act.	  Weconsider  that	the  combined effect of cl. 6  of  the	HighCourts	(Punjab)  Order,  1947, and s. 8(2)(a)	of  the	 BarCouncils  Act  1926,  was this: from  August  18,  1947,  toSeptember  28,,1948,  they  were  recognised  as   Advocatesentitled  to practise in the.  Punjab High Court  and  afterSeptember  28, 1948, they automatically came on the roll  ofadvocates  of the Punjab High Court but had to pay a fee  ofRs.  10	 to  the  Bar Council.	They did  not  cease  to  beadvocates  at any time or stage after August 15,  1947,	 andthe* continued to be advocates of the Punjab High Court tillthey were appointed as District Judges.They also had the889necessary standing of seven years to be eligible, under	 el.(2) of Art. 233 of the Constitution.These  conclusions  really dispose of the  appeal.   We	 maystate, however, that 'an alternative argument based on s.  4of  the	 Legal Practitioners Act, 1879, was  also  presentedbefore us on behalf of these respondents.  The argument	 wasthat  the respondents having been enrolled as  advocates  inthe  Lahore  High  Court were entitled to  practise  in	 anysubordinate  Court  in India, and that right was  not  takenaway  even after the Lahore High Court ceased to be  a	HighCourt in the territory of India under the Constitution.	  Aswe  are resting our decision on conclusions drawn  from	 theHigh  Courts  (Punjab)	Order, 1947, and s.  8	of  the	 BarCouncils  Act, 1926, we consider it unnecessary	 to  examinethe  alternative  argument  based  on  s.  4  of  the  LegalPractitioners Act, 1879.The appellant had devoted a large part of his writ  petitionto  support  a	contention  that  the  appointment  of	 therespondent was bad, because it contravened certain statutoryservice	 Rules.	 It was stated by the appellant that in	 thePunjab	 the  judicial	branch	of   superior	appointmentsconsisted  of 27 posts inclusive of eight listed posts;	 twoout  of	 these	eight listed posts  were  reserved  for	 themembers	 of the Bar and six for members of  the	 subordinatejudicial service.  On the partition of the Province, it	 wasstated, eleven superior judicial posts were allotted to EastPunjab,	 and the number was later increased to twelve.	 Outof these twelve posts, the appellant contended, onethird wasreserved  for the members of the Bar, onethird for what	 wascalled	the Provincial Civil Service  (Judicial'Branch)	 andthe  rest for recruitment from either of the  aforesaid	 twosources	 on merit.  The grievance of the appellant is  that,too  many  persons have been recruited from the Bak  to	 thedetriment  of  the  members  of the  service  to  which	 theappellant belongs.We  asked learned Counsel for the appellant to point out  tous any particular statutory rule which has been	 contravenedby respondent 1 in making the appointments.  Learned Counselwas unable to point890out  any  such statutory rule and except  making  a  generalgrievance that too many persons have been recruited from theBar,  he was unable even to substantiate that the  one-thirdreservation  made in favour of the service members has	beenviolated.   In	any case, unless there is clear proof  of  abreach of a statutory rule in making any of the appointmentsunder  consideration  here,  the point does  not  merit	 anydiscussion.  Such proof is singularly lacking in this case.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.				       Appeal dismissed.
