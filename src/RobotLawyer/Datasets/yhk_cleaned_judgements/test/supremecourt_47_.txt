Its	 capital was divided into  shares  on  whichdividend  could	 be earned. it provided a  building  whereinbusiness  was  to be transacted under  its  supervision	 andcontrol.  It made rules for the conduct of business of	saleand purchase of shares in the Exchange premises.  During theassessment year in question the company's receipts consistedof  certain amounts received as admission fee  from  Membersand  Authorised	 Assistants and the question stated  to	 theHigh  Court  for its opinion was whether these fees  in	 thehands of the appellant were taxable income.  The High  Courtanswered the question in the affirmative.  It held that	 theappellant was not a mutual society, that dividends could  beearned on its share capital, that any person could become  ashare-holder but every share-holder was not a member  unlesshe paid the admission fee and the real object of the companywas  to	 carry on business of exchange of  stocks  and	earnprofits.  The case of the appellant, inter alia, was that asthe  amount received as membership fee was shown as  capitalin the books of the company and there was no periodicity, itshould be treated as capital receipt exempt from assessment.799Held, that the High Court was right in its decision and	 theappeals must be dismissed.It  was	 wholly	 immaterial how the  appellant	treated	 theamounts	 in question.  It is the nature of the	receipt	 andnot  how  the assessee treated it that	must  determine	 itstaxability.  AS:Since the fee received on account of Authorised	 Assisstantsfall  within the decision of this Court in  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax  v.	Calcutta Stock	Exchange  Association  Ltd.,(1959) 36 I.T.R. 222, it must be held to be taxable income.The  question as to whether the Members' admission  fee	 wastaxable	 income	 was to be determined by the nature  of	 thebusiness  of the company, its profits and  the	distributionthereof	 as  disclosed	by its Memorandum  and	Articles  ofAssociation and the rules made for the conduct of  business.They showed that the income of the company was distributableamongst	 its  shareholders  ;is in  any	 other	joint  stockcompany,  and  the  body of trading  members  who  paid	 theentrance  fees	and share-holders were not  identical.	 Theelement of mutuality was, therefore, lacking.Liverpool  Corn Trade Association v. Monks, (1926) 2 K.	  B.110, applied.Commissioner  of  Income-tax, Bombay City v.

K. Kapur and K. K. Jain, for the appellant.B. Ganapathi Iyer and D. Gupta, for the respondent.1960.  November 30.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyKAPUR, J.-These appeals are brought by the assessee  companyagainst a common judgment and order of the Punjab High Courtby which four appeals were decided in Civil Reference No.  6of 1953.  The appeals relate to four assessment years, 1947-48, 1948-49, 1949-50 and 1950-51.  Two of these assessments,i.e., for the years 1947-48 and 1948-49 were made on the800appellant   as	successor  to  the  two	 limited   companieshereinafter mentioned.Briefly	  stated  the  facts  of  the  case  are  that	 theappellant  company  was incorporated in the year  1947.	 Itsobjects	 inter	alia  were to acquire  as  a  going  concernactivities,  functions	and business of the  Delhi  Stock  &Share Exchange Limited and the Delhi Stock and Share BrokersAssociation Limited and to promote and regulate the businessof  exchange of stocks and shares, debentures and  debenturestocks,	 Government  securities, bonds and equities  of	 anydescription  and  with	a view	thereto,  to  establish	 andconduct	 Stock	Exchange  in Delhi  and/or  elsewhere.	 Itscapital is Rs. 5,00,000 divided into 250 shares of Rs. 2,000each  on  which	 dividend could be  earned.   The  appellantcompany provided a building and a hall wherein the  businesswas  to be transacted under the supervision and	 control  ofthe  appellant.	 The appellant company also made  rules	 forthe  conduct of business of sale and purchase of  shares  inthe Exchange premises.	The total income for the year  1947-48 was Rs. 29,363 out of which a sum of Rs. 15,975 shown  asadmission fees was deducted and the income returned was	 Rs.13,388.	  In  the  profit  and loss  account  of  that	yearMembers'  admission  fees  were shown as Rs.  9,000  and  onaccount	 of Authorised Assistants admission fees Rs.  6,875.The Income-tax Officer who made the assessment for the	year1947-48	 disallowed  this  deduction.  The  return  for	 thefollowing  year	 also was made on a similar  basis  but	 thereturn	for the years 1949-50 and 1950-51 did not take	intoaccount	 the admission fees received but in  the  Director'sreport	the  amounts so received were shown as	having	beentaken  directly	 into  the balance  sheet.   The  Income-taxOfficer,  however, disallowed and added back the  amount  soreceived to the income returned by the appellant.Against	 these	orders appeals were taken to  the  AppellateAssistant   Commissioner  who  set  aside   the	  additionalassessments  made  under s. 34 in regard to  the  assessmentyears  1947-48,	 1948-49 and 1949-50 and the 4th  appeal  inregard	 to  the  year	1950-51	 was  decided  against	 theappellant.  Both sides appealed801to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal against the  respectiveorders	of  the	 Appellate Assistant  Commissioner  and	 theTribunal decided all the appeals in favour of the appellant.It  was held by one of the members of the Tribunal that	 theamounts	 received as entrance fees were intended to  be	 andwere in fact treated as capital receipts and were  thereforeexcluded from assessment and by the other that as there	 wasno  requisite periodicity, those amounts were  not  taxable.At  the instance of the respondent a case was stated to	 theHigh Court on the following question:"Whether  the  admission  fees	of  Members  or	  AuthorisedAssistants received by the assessee is taxable income in itshands?"The  High  Court  answered the question	 in  favour  of	 therespondent.  The High Court held that the appellant was	 nota  mutual  society  and therefore was not  exempt  from	 thepayment of income-tax; that it had a share capital on  whichdividend  could	 be  earned and any person  could  become  ashareholder  of the company by purchasing a share but  everyshareholder  could  not	 become	 a  member  unless  he	 wasenrolled, admitted or elected as a member and paid a sum  ofRs.  250  as  admission fee.  On becoming a  member  he	 wasentitled   to	exercise  all  rights  and   privileges	  ofmembership.   It  also	found that the real  object  of	 thecompany was to carry on business as a Stock Exchange and theearning	 of  profits.	It  was	 held  therefore  that	 theadmission  fees	 fell  within the ambit	 of  the  expression"profits  and  gains of business, profession  or  vocation".The  further  alternative argument which was  raised,  i.e.,that  the  income  fell	 under s.  10(6)  of  the  Act,	 wastherefore not decided.Mr.  Veda  Vyasa contended on behalf of the  appellant	thatthere  were only 250 members of the appellant company;	thatthe amount received as membership fees was shown as  capitalin the books of the company and there was no periodicity andtherefore  the	amounts	 which had been	 treated  as  incomeshould	have been treated as capital receipts and  thereforeexempt	from assessment.  It was firstly contended that	 thequestion did not arise out of the order of the802Tribunal  and  that a new question had been raised  but	 theobjection  is futile not only because of the absence of	 anysuch objection at the stage of the drawing up the  statementof  the	 case but also because of failure to object  in	 theHigh  Court;  nor do we see any validity  in  the  objectionraised.	  That was the only matter in controversy  requiringthe  decision of the court and was properly referred by	 theTribunal.  It was then contended that the question had to beanswered  in  the light of facts admitted or  found  by	 theTribunal and that the nature of the appellant's business  orthe  rules in regard to membership could not be	 taken	intoconsideration  in answering the question.  That again is  anunsustainable  argument.  The statement of the	case  itselfshows  that all these matters were taken into  considerationby one of the members of the Tribunal and the learned judgesof  the High Court also decided the matter on that  materialwhich had been placed before the Income tax authorities	 andwhich  was expressly referred to in their orders  and  whichagain  was  placed  before the High Court  in  the  argumentpresented there on behalf of the appellant company.It is wholly immaterial in the circumstances of the  presentcase  to  take into consideration as to	 how  the  appellanttreated the amounts in question.  It is not how an  assesseetreats	any  monies received but what is the nature  of	 thereceipts  which	 is decisive of its  being  taxable.   Theseamounts	 were  received	 by  the  appellant  as	  membershipadmission fees and as admission fees paid by the members  onaccount	 of  Authorised Assistants.  As far  as	 the  latterpayment is concerned that would fall within the decision  ofthis Court in Commissioner of Income-tax. v. Calcutta  StockExchange  Association  Ltd.  (1) and  therefore	 is  taxableincome.	 The former, i.e., members admission fees has to  bedecided in accordance with the nature of the business of theappellant   company,   its  Memorandum	 and   Articles	  ofAssociation and the Rules made for the conduct of  business.The appellant company was an association which carried on  atrade and its profits were divisible as dividend amongst theshareholders.(1)  (1959) 36 I.T.R. 222.803The object with which the company was formed was to  promoteand  regulate the business in shares, stocks and  securitiesetc.,  and to establish and conduct the business of a  StockExchange in Delhi and to facilitate the transaction of	suchbusiness.  The business was more like that in Liverpool CornTrade Association v. Monks (1).	 In that case an associationwas formed with the object of promoting the interest of corntrade  with a share capital upon which the  association	 wasempowered to declare a dividend.  The Association provided aCorn  Exchange market, newsroom and facilities for  carryingon  business and membership was confined to persons  engagedin  the	 corn trade and every member was required  to  be  ashareholder and had to pay an entrance fee.  The Associationalso  charged  the members and every person  making  use  offacilities a subscription which varied according to the	 usemade  by them.	The bulk of the receipts of the	 Associationwas  derived from entrance fees and subscriptions.   It	 wastherefore contended that the Association did not carry on  atrade and that it was a mutual association and entrance feesand   subscriptions  should  be	 disregarded  in   computingassessment  of the assessable profits.	It was held that  itwas  not a mutual association whose transactions were  inca-pable of producing a profit; that it carried on a trade	 andthe entrance fee paid by members ought to be included in theassociations receipts for purposes of computing the  profit.Rowlatt, J. said at p. 121:"I do not see why that amount is not a profit.	The  companyhas  a capital upon which dividends may be earned,  and	 thecompany	 has  assets which can be used for  the	 purpose  ofobtaining  payments from its 'members for the advantages  ofsuch  use, and one is tempted to ask why a profit is not  somade  exactly on the same footing as a profit is made  by  arailway company who issues a traveling ticket at a price  toone of its own shareholders, or at any rate as much a profitas  a profit made by a company from a dealing with  its	 ownshareholders  in a line of business which is  restricted  tothe shareholders."(1)  (1926) 2 K.B. 110.804In Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City v. Royal  WesternIndia	Turf   Club  Ltd.  (1)	this  Court   rejected	 theapplicability  of the principle of mutuality  because  therewas no mutual dealing between members inter se. There was noputting up a common fund for discharging a common obligationundertaken by the contributors for their mutual benefit	 andfor  this reason the case decided by the House of  Lords  inStyles	V. New York Life Insurance Company (2) was held	 notapplicable.In the present case the Memorandum of Association shows thatthe object with which the company was formed was to  promoteand  regulate  the business of exchange of  stocks,  shares,debentures, debenture stocks etc.  The income, if any, whichaccrued	 from  the  business of the  appellant	company	 wasdistributable  amongst the shareholders like in every  jointstock company.	According to the Articles of Association themembers	 included shareholders and members of  the  Exchangeand  according	to the rules-and bye-laws of  the  appellantcompany	 'member' means an individual, body of	individuals,firms, companies, corporations or any corporate body as	 maybe on the list of working members of the Stock Exchange	 forthe time being.	 In the Articles of Association cls. 7 &  8,provision was made for the election of members by the  Boardof  Directors and Rules 9 & 10 laid down the  procedure	 forthe  election  of  these members.  The	entrance  fees	werepayable	 by the trading members elected under the Rules	 andBylaws of the Association, who alone with their	 Associates,could  transact	 business  in  stocks  and  shares  in	 theAssociation.   Therefore,  the body of trading	members	 whopaid the entrance fees, and the shareholders among whom	 theprofits	 were  distributed were not identical and  thus	 theelement	 of mutuality was lacking.  It is the nature of	 thebusiness of the company and the profits and the distributionthereof	 which are the determining factors and in this	caseit  has not been shown that the appellants business  was  inany way different from that which was carried on in the(1) [1954] S.C.R. 289, 308.(2) (1889) 2 T.C. 460.805case  reported as Liverpool Corn Trade Association v.  Monks(1).In  our opinion the judgment of the High Court is right	 andthe appeals are therefore dismissed with costs.	 One hearingfee.					 Appeals dismissed.
