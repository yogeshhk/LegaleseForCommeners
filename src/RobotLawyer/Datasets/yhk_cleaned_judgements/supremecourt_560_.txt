The   appellant	 also	relied	 upon	 theacknowledgments of his debt by the respondent in the resolu-tion passed by the Board of Directors on May 2o, 1941 and inthe  balance  sheet of the respondent for the  year  1940-41dated October 10, 1941 :Held,  that the suit was barred by limitation as the  moniesdue  under  the deposit receipt became payable on  July	 31,1941 and as no agreement had been proved that the monies dueunder the deposit receipt were re-payable on demand.Held  further, that limitation was not saved by the  allegedacknowledgments.The  resolution of the Board of Directors merely proposed  asettlement  of a claim of the appellant, which, if  acceptedby the appellant, was to be placed before a general  meetingof the shareholders.  The resolution only referred to a pastliability  of the respondent to the appellant and it  could.not be construed as an1691332acknowledgment of the liability of the respondent under	 thedeposit receipt in question.A  copy	 of the balance sheet of 1940-41 obtained  from	 theRegistrar  of  Companies  which was filed in  the  case	 waswrongly	 rejected by the High Court as inadmissible  on	 theground that no evidence was adduced to prove it.  This	copywas  admissible	 under s. 3(b) of the  Commercial  DocumentsEvidence Act.  Under that section the Court could also raisea presumption as regards the balance sheet having been	dulymade  by or under the appropriate authority or in rggard  tothe  statements contained therein.  The presumption was	 notcompulsory  but	 was discretionary with the Court.   In	 thecircumstances of this case, where there were factions in theCompany	 and  the  regularity of the meeting  at  which	 thebalance	 sheet	was passed was in dispute,  the	 High  Courtwould  have  been  perfectly justified in  not	raising	 thepresumption.	Consequently,  the  acknowledgment  in	 thebalance sheet was of no avail to the appellant.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 77 of 1954.Appeal	from the judgment and decree dated August 25,  1949,of  the former Nagpur High Court in First Appeal No.  91  of1945  arising out of the judgment and decree dated July	 31,1945,  of  the Court of Second	Additional  District  Judge,Akola in Civil Suit No. 7-B of 1944.C.   B. Agarwala and Ratnaparkhi A. G. for the appellant.Veda Vyasa and Ganpat Rai, for the respondent.1958.  February 18.  The following Judgment of the Court wasdelivered byBHAGWATI  J.-This appeal with a certificate under s.  109(a)read  with S. 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Act  V  of1908) is directed against the judgment and decree passed  bythe Nagpur High Court dismissing the appeal of the appellantand  confirming	 the dismissal of his suit  by	the  learnedSecond Additional District Judge, Akola.The  appellant,	 who was the plaintiff in  the	trial  courtfiled in the Court of the First Additional DistrictJudge, Akola, Civil Suit No. 2-B of 1944 against the			     ---			     7-Brespondent, a limited company incorporated under the  IndianCompanies Act of 1882, which owned a			    1333Ginning	 and  Pressing Factory and carried  on	business  ofginning and pressing cotton at Akot in District Akola.The  appellant alleged that he was one of the  creditors  ofthe  company which used to borrow money, from him for  about35  years past.	 He claimed to have acted as Banker  of	 thecompany	 and the sums borrowed from him were entered in	 theaccount	 books	of the company in two khatas, one  known  ascurrent	 account or " chalu khata " and the other  describedas ,,fixed deposit khata ". An account used to be made up atthe end of' every year and the amount found due at the	footof  the	 account  was entered in the  balance-sheet  of	 thecompany	 which was adopted at the Annual General Meeting  ofthe  company.  Deposit receipts also used to be	 passed	 forthe amounts standing in the fixed deposit khata from time totime  and at the end of the year ending July 1939, a sum  ofRs. 79,519-12-9 was found due by the company to him on	boththese  accounts.  On January 15, 1940, the company passed  adeposit	 receipt  in  his favour for this  amount  which  hedemanded from the company by his letters dated May 10,	1941and  May 17, 1941.  The company failed and neglected to	 paythe  said  amount  with the result that	 he  filed  on	June16,1944, a suit against the company for recovery of a sum ofRs.  1,03,988 made up of Rs. 79,519-12-9 for  principal	 andRs.  24,468 as interest from August 1, 1939, to January	 15,1944.The  claim as laid in the plaint was that all these  amountswhich had been borrowed by the company from him were payableon  demand  to	be made by him as  creditor  and  they	weredeposits with the company, but in order that the company maynot  be compelled to pay a big sum, on demand, items in	 thecurrent account were being transferred to the fixed  depositaccount	 from time to time.  The amounts of  these  depositsbeing thus payable on demand the cause of action accrued  tohim on May 17, 1941, and limitation for the suit expired  onMay  17, 1944.	But, as the courts were closed on that	day,the suit was filed on1334the  first opening day i. e., June 16, 1944, and  limitationwas therefore saved by s. 4 of the Limitation Act.  He	alsorelied	upon  the acknowledgments of his debt  made  by	 thecompany	 in  (a)  the  resolution passed  by  the  Board  ofDirectors  on  May 20, 1941, (b) the  balance-sheet  of	 thecompany for the year 1940-41 dated October 10, 1941, and forthe  years  1941-42 and 1942-43, and (c) the  entry  in	 thekhata  of the plaintiff in the books of the company made  onor  about July 31, 1941, and signed by the Chairman  of	 thecompany.   He further relied upon an application made  unders. 162 of the Companies Act to liquidate the company on June16,  1941,  which application was however dismissed  by	 thecourt  on  June 16, 1944, stating that as he was  bona	fideprosecuting this application for the same relief as  claimedin  the	 suit and as the court was unable to  entertain	 theapplication because the debt was disputed by the company, hewas  entitled to deduct from the period of  limitation,	 thetime spent by him under s. 14 of the Limitation Act.This claim of the appellant was contested by the  respondentmainly on the ground that the suit was barred by the law  oflimitation.  Both the courts below negatived his claim.	 Thetrial  court  dismissed	 his suit and  the  High  Court,  onappeal, dismissed his appeal and confirmed the dismissal  ofhis suit by the trial court; hence this appeal.The only question which arises for our consideration in thisappeal	is  whether  the  appellant's  suit  was  barred  bylimitation.   The appellant, in the first  instance,  reliedupon the deposit receipt which was passed by the company  inhis  favour  on January 15, 1940.  This receipt	 (Ex.	P-1)evidenced  a deposit of Rs. 79,519-12-9 for 12	months	fromAugust 1, 1939, to July 31, 1940, and the amount at the footthereof	 became due and payable by the respondent to him  onJuly 31, 1940.	The appellant, however, sought to extend thecommencement of the period of limitation to May 17, 1941, onthe  ground  that  the monies, the  subject-matter  of	thatdeposit	 receipt, were payable to him on demand,  that	suchdemand was made by him1335on  May 17, 1941, and that therefore that was the  date	 forthe  commencement of the period of limitation.	 No  expressagreement in this behalf could be proved by him nor could anagreement be implied from the course of dealings between himand the company for the period of 25 years during which	 thedealings  continued  between the parties.  As  a  matter  offact,  such  an agreement, either express  or  implied,	 wasnegatived  by the very terms of the deposit  receipt  which,apart  from mentioning that the monies were received by	 thecompany	 as  deposit for 12 months from August 1,  1939,  toJuly 31, 1940, contained on the reverse a note that interestwould  cease on due date.  This was sufficient to  establishthat  the  amount  due at the foot of  the  deposit  receiptbecame due and payable on the due date mentioned therein andthat  there was no question of the amount being	 payable  atany  time thereafter on demand being made in this behalf  bythe  creditor.	The course of dealings between	the  partiesalso  negatived any such agreement because it  appears	fromthe  record  that such deposit receipts were passed  by	 thecompany	 in  his  favour from time to  time,  each  of	suchreceipts  being for a fixed period in the same terms as	 thedeposit	 receipt  in question and  the	receipts  containingsimilar	 notes on the reverse that interest would  cease  ondue  date.   Both the courts below were therefore  right  incoming to the conclusion that there was no agreement of	 thekind put forward by the appellant that the monies due at thefoot  of the deposit receipt in question were  repayable  ondemand	and that monies due at the foot thereof	 became	 dueand payable by the company to him on July 31, 1940.The  next  question  to	 consider  is  whether	the  bar  oflimitation  which  set	in on July 31, 1943,  was  saved  byreason	of  the	 circumstances set out	in  the	 plaint	 foravoidance of the same.	Out of the three acknowledgments  ofdebt pleaded by the appellant the third was abandoned by himin   the   course   of	the  hearing  and   the	  only	 twoacknowledgments	 which were pressed were (a) the  resolutionpassed	by the Board of Directors on May 20, 194 1, and	 (b)the balance-sheet of the company for the year 1940-41  datedOctober 10,13361941.	It  may be noted that he made no attempt at  all  toprove the balance-sheets of the company for the years  1941-42 and 194-2-43.In regard to the resolution passed by the Board of Directorson  May 20, 1941, the position is that at that	meeting	 onePandurang  Narsaji Hadole, who was one of the  Directors  ofthe  company. made a reference to a:proposed  settlement  ofthe claim of the appellant for a sum of RIB. 67,939 as founddue at the end of July 1936, which had been resolved upon bythe Board of Directors on December 22,1936, but had not beenaccepted  by the appellant.  The resolution  then  requestedthe  appellant to inform the company again if even  then  hewas  prepared  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  that  proposedsettlement which would be placed before the general  meetingof  all	 the  share-holders of the company if  a  reply	 wasreceived from him in the affirmative.This resolution of the Board of Directors was alleged by theappellant to be an acknowledgment of a subsisting  liabilityin regard to the debt due by the company to him at the	footof  the deposit receipt in question'.  We do not see how  itcould  ever  be	 spelt	out  as	 such  acknowledgment.	 Thecontents of the resolution only referred to a past liabilityof  the	 company  to the appellant  and	 there	was  nothingtherein which could by any stretch be construed as referringto  the liability of the company, to him at the foot of	 thedeposit	 receipt dated January 15, 1940.  Our attention	 wasdrawn  to the deposit receipts which had been passed by	 thecompany in favour of the appellant on May 30, 1935,  October18, 1936, and November 30,1938, each of which was for a	 sumof  Rs.	 47,500.  No connection	 was,  however,	 establishedbetween	 the sum of Rs. 47,500, the subject-matter of  thesereceipts, and the sum of Rs. 79,519-12-9, the subject-matterof the deposit receipt in question and in the absence of anysuch connection 'having been established the appellant couldnot avail himself of the alleged acknowledgment of liabilitycontained in the resolution of the Board of Directors  datedMay 20, 1941,1337even if it could perchance be construed as an acknowledgmentof a subsisting liability.  This resolution of the Board  ofDirectors  dated May 20, 1941, could not,  therefore,  availthe appellant as an acknowledgment of his debt.In regard to the balance-sheet of the company for' the	year1940-41 dated October 10, 1941, it is to be noted that, eventhough	the  appellant applied before the  trial  court	 forfiling	the balance-sheet of 1940-41 on April 28,  1945,  heexpressly  stated  that he did not want to adduce  any	oralevidence to prove it.  He was, however, allowed to file	 thesame.  But it was realised later that the balance-sheet	 didnot  prove itself and he therefore made another	 applicationon  July  11, 1945, for permission to file a copy  from	 theRegistrar  of  Companies  and  contended  that	this  proveditself.	  This document was, however, rejected by the  trialcourt  as  filed  too late.  When the  appeal  came  up	 forhearing before the High Court, it was contended on behalf ofthe  appellant	that  the copy which was  adduced  from	 theoffice of the Registrar was admissible in evidence but	thatevidence  was rejected by the High Court on a  considerationof  ss. 65 and 74(2) of the Evidence Act.  The attention  ofthe  High  Court was evidently not drawn to  the  CommercialDocuments  Evidence Act (XXX of 1939) which has amended	 theLaw   of  Evidence  with  respect  to	certain	  commercialdocuments.   Section  3 of that Act enacts that	 "  for	 thepurposes   of	the   Indian   Evidence	  Act,	 1872,	 andnotwithstanding	  anything  contained  therein,	  a   Court:(a).........................................................(b)  may  presume,  within  the	 meaning  of  that  Act,  inrelation to documents included in Pt. 11 of the Schedule :-That  any document purporting to be a document	included  inPart  I or Part II of the Schedule, as the case may be,	 andto  have  been	duly  made  by	or  under  the	 appropriateauthority,  was	 so made and that the  statements  containedtherein are accurate.  "Item No. 21 in Pt. 11 of the Schedule mentions:-1338"  Copy,  certified  by the Registrar of  Companies  of	 theBalance	 Sheet, Profit and Loss Account, and audit i  reportof a company, filed with the said Registrar under the IndianCompanies Act, 1913 and the rules made thereunder.If  the attention of the High Court had been drawn  to	thisprovision  of law, we are sure, it would not  have  rejectedthe copy of the balance-sheet obtained by the appellant fromthe  office  of the Registrar of Companies.  We are  of	 theopinion that the copy should have been admitted in  evidenceand we do hereby admit the same.The  appellant	contends that that balance-sheet  which	 wassigned	by the Directors contained an acknowledgment of	 thedebt due by the company to the appellant for the sum of	 Rs.67,939	as  and	 by  way  of  fixed  deposit  and  that	 wassufficient  to	save the bar of	 limitation.   The  questiontherefore  arises whether any presumption can be  raised  asregards the balance-sheet having been duly made by or  underthe  appropriate authority or in regard	 to the accuracy  ofthe statement contained therein under s. 3(b) of the Commer-cial Docuinents Evidence Act (XXX of 1939).It is to be noted that this presumption is not compulsory asin the case of s. 3(a) of the Act; it is discretionary	withthe court.  The difficulty in the way of the appellant	hereis  however  insuperable  because we find  that	 there	werefactions  in the company at or about the relevant  time.   ADirectors'  meeting  was  held on April 27,  1941,  and	 theresignation  of the appellant as the Chairman  was  acceptedand  another  person was appointed in his place.   A  secondmeeting	 was  called  for May 17, 1941, but  it	 had  to  beadjourned for want of a quorum.	 The adjourned meeting washeld on May 20,1941, but no balance-sheet was passed at thatmeeting.  There is nothing on the record to show that  therewas  another meeting of the Board of Directors	for  passingthe  balance-sheet of the company for the year	1940-41.   Ageneral meeting of the Shareholders was called for  November16,  1941, to pass the balance-sheet.  This also had  to  beadjourned to the following day for want of a quorum.  At the1339adjourned  meeting the shareholders then present refused  topass the accounts and it was not till some five weeks later,namely on December 30, 1941, that the rival faction met	 andpassed the accounts.  But this meeting only purported to  bea continuation of the meeting which bad to be adjourned	 forwant of a quorum and that clearly was irregular because	 theadjourned meeting had to be called within twentyfour  hours.It did not purport to be a fresh meetino, convened after duenotice, etc.  Under the circumstances,it could not be  urgedthat the balance-sheet was duly passed.Even  if the attention of the High Court had been  drawn  tothe  provisions	 of  s. 3 (b) of  the  Commercial  DocumentsEvidence  Act,	(XXX of 1939) it would have  been  perfectlyjustified  in not, raising the presumption in regard to	 thebalance-sheet  having  been  duly  made	 by  or	 under	 theappropriate  authority and in regard to the accuracy of	 thestatement  contained  therein.	We are,	 therefore,  of	 theopinion that this alleged acknowledgment also is of no availto the appellant.In  regard to s. 14 of the Indian Limitation Act  which	 wassought to be relied upon by the appellant, it may be shortlystated	that the liquidation proceedings had not been  filedin  the courts below and there is nothing to show  that	 therequirements  of  s. 14 were at all  satisfied.	  No  cogentargument  has  been  advanced before us	 on  behalf  of	 theappellant which would induce us to hold that the  conclusionreached by the High Courtin this behalf was incorrect in anymanner whatever.On all the above grounds we have come to the conclusion thatthe  appellant's  claim	 was  clearly  timebarred  and	 thedismissal  of  his suit by the trial court as  well  as	 thedismissal of his appeal by the High Court were in order.This appeal will therefore stand dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.170
