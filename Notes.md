Avenues within Legal NLP:
(Ref: https://www.engineersgarage.com/featured/role-of-ai-in-legal-practice/)
- Formal models of legal reasoning
- Computational models of argumentation, decision-making and evidential reasoning
- Legal reasoning in multi-agent systems
- Executable models of legislation
- Automatic legal text classification and summarization;
- Automated information extraction from legal databases and texts
- ML and data mining for e-discovery and other legal applications
- Conceptual or model-based legal information retrieval
- Lawbots to automate minor and repetitive legal tasks
- Risk assessment, pricing, and timeline predictions of litigation using ML and AI.
- Due Diligence -To review a contract, conduct legal research or performing electronic discovery functions to do due diligence, AI legal software are proving to be helpful and time effective.
- Prediction Technology- Artificial intelligence legal software also predicts the probable outcome of the cases being adjudicated before the Court of Law.
- Legal Analytics- Artificial Intelligence provides for the data points from past case laws, and also provides judgments and precedent law to be used by lawyers in their present cases.
- Automation of Documentation- By just submitting the required documents which you wish to incorporate in your legal document get your documents ready within minutes.
- Intellectual Property- Tools of artificial intelligence helps in providing the insights into the IP portfolios i.e. search and registration of a trademark, Patent, Copyrights etc.
- Electronic Billing- Artificial intelligence legal software also helps the lawyer and Firms in preparing the invoices as per the work done by them. It makes for accurate billing for the work done by a lawyer. Thus, helps both lawyers and clients.

Law and Word Order: NLP in Legal Tech - Robert Dale
(Ref: https://towardsdatascience.com/law-and-word-order-nlp-in-legal-tech-bd14257ebd06 )
- Legal Tech is densly populated, number of companies https://techindex.law.stanford.edu/
- Key areas:
	- Legal research: finding information relevant to a legal decision
	- Electronic discovery: determining the relevance of documents to an information request
	- Contract review: checking that a contract is complete and avoids risk
	- Document automation: generating routine legal documents
	- Legal advice: using question-and-answer dialogs to provide tailored advice
- Electronic search and retrieval, old-fashioned Boolean search slowly AI now
  - Lexis Nexis claims to have over 30TB of content
	- Others are: Westlaw (now Thomson Reuters), Wolters Kluwer and Bloomberg Law 
	- Ross has NLP query via IBM Watson
- eDiscovery: Finding similar/relevant documents
  -  Exterro, DISCO to bring relevant documents. OpenText 
- Contract review: make comments and changes or negotiate for better terms.
  - Kira, Seal: pre-built models for common provisions covering a range of contract types;
  - LawGeeks: compare contracts against pre-defined company policies.
	- Smaller players: specific document types, such as NDAs, real-estate leases
- Document automation : fill-in-the-blanks templating mechanism
- Legal advice: Robot Lawyers

Stephen Wolfram : Computational Law, Symbolic Discourse and the AI Constitution
- Leibnizâ€™s Dream: turning human law into an exercise in computation.
- Knowledge-based Wolfram Language: formal, computable, symbolic
- To encode to be able to capture the full range of human activities and human legal specifications.
- A symbolic discourse language is about representing things in the world. Natural language is just one way to try to describe those things, at least to some approximation 
- Contracts into Code:  translate natural language to symbolic language.
