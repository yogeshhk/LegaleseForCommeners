# Harvardx: HLS2X Contract Law: From Trust to Promise to Contract

## Unit 1:
Four principles, the idea that not all promises are contracts:
- The invitation to dinner and not honoring it, showing the informal or no intent to create legal relations example;
- Both sides serious:
   - The silver watch of $15 for $300, promises which are jokes and are not contracts, even though they have the form of a contract;
   - Pepsico promising jet harrier for $700 was not serious as it was a advt joke, a funny exaggeration
- Husband and girlfriend promises, 
   - the immoral contract.
   - when promises which are exchanged for nothing, when there is no bargain, those are also not contracts.
   
Court will stand behind promises, but those which are real bargains.
