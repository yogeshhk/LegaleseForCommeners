Kurian Joseph, J.

1. This is in continuation of our judgment dated 26.02.2016.

2. It appears that one part of the judgment is left out, which was to the effect that the compensation awarded in these cases is confined to the facts of the case and the same shall not have any precedential value.

3. The judgment dated 26.02.2016 is clarified accordingly.
