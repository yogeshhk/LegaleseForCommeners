Group: Right Steps Pune
Method: Fully Automatic

Approach keywords: Sequence Labeling, Custom Named Entity Recognition, CoNLL IOB, CRF++

Steps:
	1. Preparation of Training data:
		- For each case in Training folder, corresponding catchphrases file was looked at.
		- CoNLL like IOB data was prepared automatically by python script
		- B-LEGAL and I-LEGAL tags where added to places corresponding to given catchphrases
		- At positions corresponding to the rest of the tokens, "O" was added.
		- POS tags where also added for each token.
		- So training data file looked like:

			in 	IN 	O
			the 	DT 	O
			year 	NN 	O
			1987 	CD 	O
			and 	CC 	O
			that 	IN 	O
			property 	NN 	B-LEGAL
			had 	VBD 	O
			extensive 	JJ 	O
			national 	JJ 	B-LEGAL
			highway 	NN 	I-LEGAL
			frontage 	NN 	O

			It had word, POS, custom NER tags.
		- and testing data file looked like:

			appeals 	NN
			the 	NNS
			high 	DT
			court 	JJ
			accepted 	NN
			the 	VBD
			view 	DT
			of 	NN
			the 	IN
			tribunal 	DT

			It had word, POS and no NER tag
		- Task was to build a model using the training data and predict LEGAL tags for the testing data
	2. Sequence Labeling:
		- Tried many approaches like Keras (LSTM), goldparse by Spacy, nltk HMM, Stanford NER for sequence labeling, but did not get good results.
		- CRF++ library gave better results. Features used were Unigrams of previous two words and POS tags, Bigram, etc.
