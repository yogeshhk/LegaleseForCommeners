The High Court, on reference, agreed with the	viewof the Tribunal.Held,  that  in view of the legal fiction  contained  in  s.18A(9) of the Act that when an assessee has failed to complywith s.	  18A(3)  he  "shall  be deemed to  have  failed  tofurnish the return of his total income and the provisions ofs.  28,	 so far as may be, shall apply	accordingly  ",	 thefailure	 to  send  an estimate of the tax  under  s.  18A(3)should	be  treated as failure to furnish return  of  incomeunder  s. 22.  Accordingly, it was competent to the  Income-tax authorities to impose a penalty under S. 28 read with s.18A(9)(b)  where there has been a failure to comply with  s.18A(3).The relevant provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act,  1922,are set out in the judgment.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 122 of 1957.Appeal from the order dated November 4, 1954, of the  PunjabHigh  Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Civil Reference	 No.15 of 1953.R.   Ganapathy	Iyer,  R. H. Dhebar and D.  Gupta,  for	 theappellant.P.   M. Mukhi, Gopal Singh for Udhai Bhan Choudhry, for	 therespondent.P.   M. Mukhi and Ganpat Rai, for Dalmia Jain Aviation	Ltd.(now Asia Udyog Ltd.) (Intervener).1958.	November 5. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyVENKATARAMA AIYAR, J.-This is an appeal against the judgmentof the High Court of Punjab in a reference under s. 66(1) ofthe Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, hereinafter referred to  asthe Act.The facts are that the respondent, had not been assessed  toincome-tax prior to the assessment year 1948-49.  On July 4,1949,  he  made suo motu returns showing an  income  of	 Rs.4,494  for  the accounting year 1947-48 being  the  previousyear  for the assessment year 1948-49 and an income  of	 Rs.31,646 for396the accounting year 1948-49 being the previous year for	 theassessment  year 1949-50.  By orders dated August 25,  1949,the   Income-tax  Officer  assessed  the  income   for	 theassessment year 1948-49 at Rs. 6,277 and for the  assessmentyear 1949-50 at Rs. 36,281.  The correctness of these ordersis  not	 in question before us.	 We are concerned  in  theseproceedings with the vires of an order, which the Income-taxOfficer	 made on October 9, 1950, under s. 28 read with	 ss.18A(3) and 18A(9) of the Act.  It will be convenient to	 setout  these provisions, so far as they are material  for	 thepurpose of this appeal.	 Section 18A(3) provides that :"  Any	person	who has not hitherto  been  assessed  shall,before the 15th day of March in each financial year, if	 histotal income of the period which would be the previous	yearfor  an assessment for the financial year next following  islikely to exceed six thousand rupees, send to the Income-taxOfficer	 an estimate of the tax payable by him on that	partof  his income to which the provisions of section 18 do	 notapply  of  the said previous year calculated in	 the  mannerlaid  down in sub-section (1), and shall pay the amount,  onsuch of the dates specified in that sub-section as have	 notexpired,  by instalments which may be revised  according  tothe proviso to sub-section (2)."Section 18A(9) is as follows:"   If	the  Income-tax	 Officer,  in  the  course  of	 anyproceedings  in connection with the regular  assessment,  issatisfied that any assessee-(a)  has  furnished under sub-section (2) or  sub-section(3)estimates of the tax payable by him which he knew or	 hadreason to believe to be untrue, or(b)  has without reasonable cause failed to comply with	 theprovisions of subsection (3), the assessee shall be  deemed,in the case referred to in clause (a), to have	deliberatelyfurnished  inaccurate particulars of his income, and in	 thecase  referred to in clause (b), to have failed	 to  furnishthe  return  of	 his total income;  and	 the  provisions  ofsection 28, so far' as may be, shall apply accordingly:".397Then, there is a proviso which imposes a limit on the amountof penalty, which can be levied.  Section 28 of the Act runsas follows:(1) " If the Income-tax Officer....... in the course of	 anyproceedings under this Act, is satisfied that any person-(a)has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the returnof  his	 total income which he was required  to	 furnish  bynotice	given  under sub-section (1) or	 subsection  (2)  ofsection	 22  or section 34 or has without  reasonable  causefailed	to  furnish it within the time allowed	and  in	 themanner required by such notice, or(b)has	without	 reasonable cause failed to  comply  with  anotice under subsection (4) of section 22 or subsection	 (2)of section 23, or(c)has	 concealed   the  particulars  of  his	 income	  ordeliberately   furnished  inaccurate  particulars  of	suchincome,he.....	 may  direct that such person shall pay	 by  way  ofpenalty, in the case referred to in clause (a), in  additionto  the	 amount	 of the income-tax  and	 supertax,  if	any,payable by him a sum not exceeding one and a half times thatamount, and in the cases referred to in clauses (b) and (c),in  addition to any tax payable by him, a sum not  exceedingone and a half times the amount of the income-tax and super-tax, if any, which would have been avoided if the income  asreturned  by  such person had been accepted as	the  correctincome:".The  Income-tax	 Officer  held that as	the  respondent	 hadfailed	to  send  an estimate of the tax on  his  income  asprovided  in  s.  18A(3) he became liable  to  be  proceededagainst	 under s. 28, and accordingly imposed a	 penalty  ofRs. 40 for the year 1948-49 and Rs. 1,000 for the year 1949-50.    On  appeal,  the	 Appellate  Assistant	Commissionerconfirmed  the order in so far as it imposed a	penalty	 forthe year 1948-49 but set it aside as regards the year  1949-50  on the ground that by reason of the assessment  for	 theyear 1948-49 the respondent ceased to be a new assessee	 for1949-50,  and  that,  in  consequence,	s.  18A(3)  had	  noapplication.   Against the order cancelling the penalty	 for1949-50,398the Income-tax Officer preferred an appeal to the  AppellateTribunal,  which  disagreed with the view of  the  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner that the respondent was no longer  anew assessee within s. 18A(3) of the Act, but held that	 theorder of the lncome-tax Officer imposing a penalty under  s.28  was ultra vires, because that section would,  in  terms,apply  only when a person failed to furnish the return	whenhe  was required so to do by notice under s. 22 or s. 34  ofthe  Act,  and	that there could be  Do	 such  notices	withreference to estimates of tax on income to be sent under  s.18A(3).	  In  the result, the appeal was dismissed.  On	 theapplication  of	 the appellant, the  Tribunal  referred	 thefollowing question for the opinion of the High	  Court:" Whether on a true construction of Section 18A(9) (b) readwith section 28 of the Indian Income-tax Act,1922, a penaltymay  be	 imposed  for a total failure  to  comply  with	 theprovisions of Section 18A(3) of the said Act ?"The reference was heard by Bhandari, C. J., and Falshaw, J.,who  agreed  with  the Tribunal that the  conditions  as  tonotice	laid down in s. 22(1) or s. 22(2) must be  satisfiedeven  when  action  was sought to be taken under  s.  28  inrespect	 of a failure to comply with s. 18A(3), and that  asthose conditions had not been satisfied, the order  imposingpenalty	 was bad.  The appellant applied for  a	 certificateunder  s. 66A(2) of the Act, and the same was  granted,	 andthat is how the appeal comes before us.The sole question that arises for our determination in thisappeal is whether under s. 28(1) read with s.	  18A(9)  ofthe  Act, it is competent to the Income-tax  authorities  toimpose	a penalty on a person who has failed to comply	withs. 18A(3) of the Act.  In answering it in the negative,	 thelearned	 Judges	 in the court below were  influenced  almostexclusively  by the terms of s. 28 which they held  did	 notcover-	failure	 to comply with s. 18A(3).   Now,  s.  28(1)provides for penalty being imposed in three classes of caseswhich are mentioned respectively in cls. (a), (b). and	(c).Clause (b) deals with cases where there has been failure399to produce documents or accounts or other evidence which theassessee  had been required to produce under s. 22(4) or  s.23(2)  of the Act, and that is not relevant for the  purposeof  the	 present discussion.  Then, there are cls.  (a)	 and(c), and they have reference, stating it in plain  language,cl.  (a) to failure to make a return and cl. (c)  to  makingfalse  return.	Now, the learned Judges observe that  if  anestimate of the tax is furnished under s. 18A(3) and that isdeliberately  inaccurate, that will fall under	s.  28(1)(c)read  with s. 18A (9)(a) and penalty could be imposed  underthat section, but that that could not be done when there  isfailure to furnish an estimate as required by s. 18A(3), be-cause  sub-s.  (1) of s. 28 would apply only when  a  personfailed to furnish the return when he had been required to doso  by	notice under s. 22(1) or s. 22(2) or s. 34,  or	 hadfailed	to  furnish it within the time allowed	and  in	 themanner	required by the notice, and that there could  be  nosuch  notice with reference to s. 18A(3).  Say	the  learnedJudges: "  In	the  first  place, a person who	 fails	to  send  anestimate under section 18A(3) cannot be said to have  failedto  furnish  the  return of his total income  which  he	 wasrequired  to  furnish in response to a notice  issued  undersection	 22 or section 34; secondly, the said person  cannotbe  said  to  have failed to furnish  it.  within  the	timeallowed	 and  in the manner required by	 such  notice,	for,estimates under section 18A(3) must be furnished before	 the15th  March in the financial year immediately preceding	 theyear  of  assessment  whereas the returns  required  by	 thenotices	 under sections 22 and 34 can be furnished at  laterdates."With respect, the error in this reasoning lies in this	thatit  fails to give due effect to the fiction contained in  s.18A(9)(b)  of  the  Act.   Under  that	provision,  when  anassessee  has failed to comply with s. 18A(3) he " shall  bedeemed	to  have failed to furnish the return of  his  totalincome	and the provisions of section 28, so far as may	 be,shall  'apply  accordingly."  In other	words'	by  a  legalfiction the failure to send an estimate of the tax under  s.18A(3) is treated as a400failure	 to furnish return of income under s. 22.  It  is  anecessary  implication of this fiction that the estimate  oftax  on	 the income to be submitted under s. 18A(3)  is,  infact, different from the return to be furnished under s. 22,and to appreciate the full significance of this fiction,  itis necessary to examine what the distinction is.  Under s. 3of the Act, the tax is payable on the income of the previousyear.	A  statement of that income can	 be  furnished	onlyafter that year ends, and s. 22 enacts provisions as to whenit is to be furnished in the assessment year.	Sub-sections(1) and (2) provide for notices being given and the assesseeis  required  to  file his statement of	 income	 within	 theperiod	provided therein, and it is this statement  that  istermed	" return ". Section 18A(3), however, relates to	 thesending	 of  a	statement  of  tax  on	the  income  of	 theaccounting  year before the 15th day of March of  that	yearitself,	 and  that statement is termed not a return  but  anestimate,  and quite rightly, because in the very nature  ofit,  it	 can only be that.  A person who sends	an  estimateunder s. 18A(3) has also to send a return of his income	 forthe accounting year under s. 22, and sub-ss. (4) and (5)  ofs.  18A provide for adjustment of advance tax paid under  s.18A(3)	towards	 the tax as finally computed  under  s.	 23.Thus,  there  is  a clear distinction between  a  return  ofincome	under  s. 22, which can only be during the  year  ofassessment and an estimate of tax on income under s. 18A(3),which can only be in the year of account.It  is in the light of this distinction that the  effect  ofthe legal fiction enacted ins. 18A(9) (b) that when a personfails  to  send an estimate of tax on his  income  under  s.18A(3)	he shall be deemed to have failed to furnish  returnof  his	 income,  will have to be  judged.   The  respondentcontends that its effect is only to place the estimate to besent under s. 18A(3) on the same footing as the return unders. 22 for purposes of s. 28, and that that does not abrogatethe  other  conditions laid down in that  section  on  whichalone action could be taken thereunder and penalty  imposed,and one of those conditions is the issue of notice under  s.22(1) or s.    22(2).	But it must be noted that s.  18A(9)(b) does401not  merely  say that an estimate under S. 18A(3)  shall  bedeemed	to be a return.	 It enacts that the failure to	sendan estimate in accordance with s. 18A(3) is to be deemed  tobe a failure to make a return.	Now, there can be no failureto  make  a return, unless notice had been issued  under  s.22(1) or s. 22(2) and there has been a default in  complyingwith  that notice.  Therefore, the fiction that the  failureto send an estimate is to be deemed to be a failure to	senda  return necessarily involves the fiction that	 notice	 hadbeen  issued  under s. 22, and that had	 not  been  compliedwith.	It is a rule of interpretation well settled that  inconstruing  the scope of a legal fiction it would be  properand even necessary to assume all those facts on which  alonethe   fiction	can  operate.	The   following	  off-quotedobservations of Lord Asquith in East End Dwellings Co.	Ltd.v.  Finsbury  Borough  Council	(1)  may  appropriately	  bereferred to:"  If you are bidden to treat an imaginary state of  affairsas  real, you must surely, unless prohibited from doing	 so,also  imagine as real the consequences and incidents  which,if  the putative state of affairs had in fact existed,	mustinevitably have flowed from or accompanied it.	One of thesein  this case is emancipation from the 1939 level of  rents.The  statute says that you must imagine a certain  state  ofaffairs; it does not say that having done so, you must causeor  permit your imagination to boggle when it comes  to	 theinevitable corollaries of that state of affairs."The  fiction under s. 18A(9) (b) therefore that	 failure  tosend  an  estimate under s. 18A(3) is to be deemed to  be  afailure	 to send a return must mean that all those facts  onwhich alone there could be a failure to send the return mustbe deemed to exist, and it must accordingly be taken that byreason	of  this fiction, the notices required to  be  givenunder  s. 22 must be deemed to have been given, and in	thatview, s. 28 would apply on its own terms.Some  argument was addressed to us based on the use  of	 thedefinite article "the" qualifying the word(1)  [1952] A.C. 109, 132.51402"return" in s. 18-A(9)(b).  It was said that that expressionmeant the - return which is to be furnished under of s.	 22,and  that that requires that there must have been  a  noticeissued	under s. 22(1) or s. 22(2), before action  could  betaken  under  s. 28.  In the view expressed above  that	 thefiction	 enacted in s. 18-A(9)(b) involves the fiction	thatnotices	 had  been issued under s. 22(1) or s.	22(2),	thiscontention does not call for further consideration.It  was finally argued that a fiscal statute and  especiallyone  imposing  a penalty, should be strictly  construed	 andthat  if  the  words of the enactment  be  not	sufficientlyexplicit  to reach the subject, the Revenue must  fail,	 andthe  following observations in Vestey's (Lord) Executors  v.Inland	Revenue Commissioners (1) were relied on in  supportof this position :"Parliament in its attempts to keep pace with the  ingenuitydevoted	 to  tax avoidance may fall short  of  its  purpose.That  is a -misfortune for the taxpayers who do not  try  toavoid  their share of the burden and it is disappointing  tothe  Inland  Revenue.  But the court. will not	stretch	 theterms of taxing Acts in order to: improve on the efforts  ofParliament  and	 to  stop gaps which are left  open  by	 thestatutes.   Tax	 avoidance is an evil, but it would  be	 thebeginning  of  much  greater evils if  the  courts  were  tooverstretch the language of the statute in order to  subjectto taxation people of whom they disapproved."These observations would be in, point if the language of theenactment  left us in any doubt as to what  the	 legislaturemeant.	 But can that be said of s. 18-A(9)(b)?	 Its  objectavowedly  is to assimilate the position of a person who	 hasfailed	to send the estimate under s. 18-A 3) to that  of  aperson	who has failed to furnish the return.. under s.	 22,and  that object is sought to. be achieved by  enacting	 thefiction	 which is contained in s. 18-A(9)(b).  And  'if,  onthe  principles laid down in East End Dwellings Co. Ltd.  v.Finsbury  Boorough  Council  (2), the true  effect  of	thatfiction is that it imports that notice had been issued unders.  22, then the conditions prescribed in s. 28 of  the	 Actare satisfied and(1) [1949] 1 All E.R. 1108, 1120.(2) [1952] A.C. 109, 132.403penalty	 could be imposed under that section for failure  tocomply	with  s.  18-A(3), on the  clear  language  of	thatenactment itself without straining or overstretching it.We  must  now  refer to an aspect  of  the  question,  whichstrongly  reinforces  the conclusion stated above.   On	 theconstruction contended for by the respondent, s.  18-A(9)(b)would  become  wholly nugatory, as ss. 22(1) and  22(2)	 canhave  no  application to advance estimates to  be  furnishedunder  s. 18-A(3), and if we accede to this  contention,  wemust hold that though the legislature enacted s.  18-A(9)(b)with  the  very	 object	 of bringing  the  failure  to	sendestimates under s. 18-A(3) within the operation of s. 28, itsignally failed to achieve its object.	A construction whichleads  to  such	 a  result must, if  that  is  possible,  beavoided,,  on the principle expressed in the maxim, "ut	 resmagis valeat quam pereat".  Vide Curtis v. Stovin (1) and inparticular the following observations of Fry, L. J., at page519 :I  "The	 only alternative construction offered to  us  wouldlead  to  this	result,	 that the  plain  intention  of	 thelegislature  has  entirely  failed by  reason  of  a  slightinexactitude in the language of the section.  If we were  toadopt this construction, we should be construing the Act  inorder to defeat its object rather than with a view to  carryits object into effect".Vide  also Craies on Statute Law, p. 90 and Maxwell  on	 TheInterpretation	of  Statutes, Tenth Edn., pp.  236-237.	  "Astatute	 is designed", observed Lord Dunedin in	 Whitney  v.Commissioners  of Inland Revenue (2), "to be  workable,	 andthe  interpretation thereof by a court should be  to  securethat  object,  unless crucial omission	or  clear  directionmakes that end unattainable".We  are accordingly of opinion that it was competent to	 theIncome-tax authorities to impose a penalty under s. 28	readwith s. 18-A(9)(b) where there has been a failure to  complywith s. 18-A(3).in  the result., we set aside the order of the	court  belowand answer the reference in the affirmative.(1) [1889] 22 Q.B.D. 513.(2) [1925] 10 Tax Cas. 88, 110.404The    appellant will have his costs here and in the courtIf  below.
