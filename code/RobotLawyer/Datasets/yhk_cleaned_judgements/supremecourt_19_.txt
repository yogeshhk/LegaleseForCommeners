Thus they were not entitled to any bonus.The  Associated	 Cement	 Companies Ltd.	 v.  Their  Workmen,[1959]	S.C.R.	925 and The Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd.  v.

Setalvad, Attorney-General for India  and	 JanardanSharma,	 for  the  respondents	in  C.A.  No.  153/  60	 andAppellants in C.A. No. 154/60.1960.	December 9. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyWANCHOO, J.-The only question raised in these two appeals byspecial	 leave is about the quantum of bonus to be  paid  tothe  workmen (hereinafter called the respondents) by  VoltasLimited (hereinafter called the appellant) for the financialyear 1956-57.  The dispute between the parties was  referredto the adjudication of the industrial tribunal Bombay.	 Theappellant, it appears, had already paid 4 1/2 months'  basicwages  as  bonus for the relevant year but  the	 respondentsclaimed it at the rate of six months' basic wages subject tothe minimum of Rs. 250 per employee.			    169The  tribunal  went into the figures and  after	 making	 therelevant  calculations	came  to  the  conclusion  that	 theavailable  surplus  worked out according to  the  Full-Benchformula	 justified the grant of bonus equal to five  months'basic  salary; it therefore ordered payment of	this  amountexcluding  the	amount already paid.  The appellant  in	 itsappeal claims that the tribunal should have allowed  nothingmore   than  what  the	appellant  had	already	 paid;	 therespondents  in	 their appeal on the other hand	 claim	thatthey should have been allowed six months' bonus.The  principles	 on which bonus has to	be  calculated	havealready been decided by this Court in the Associated  CementCompanies  Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) and the  only  questionthat arises for our consideration is whether the tribunal inmaking	its calculations has acted in accordance with  thoseprinciples.   This leads us to the consideration of  variouspoints	raised	on behalf of the parties to  show  that	 thetribunal had not acted in all particulars in accordance withthe decision in the Associated Cement Companies' case (1).We  shall  first  take the points raised on  behalf  of	 theappellant.  The first point raised is that the tribunal	 waswrong  in  not	allowing a sum of rupees  one  lac  paid  ascontribution to political fund as an item of expense.  It isurged  that  this  is  a permissible  item  of	expense	 andtherefore  the	tribunal should not have added	it  back  inarriving  at the gross profits.	 We are of opinion that	 thetribunal   was	right  in  not	allowing  this	 amount	  asexpenditure.   In effect this payment is no  different	fromany amount given in charity by an employer, and though	suchpayment	 may  be justified in the sense that it may  not  beagainst	 the  Articles	of Association of a  company  it  isnonetheless  an expense which need not be incurred  for	 thebusiness of the company.  Besides, though in this particularcase the donation considering the circumstances of the	casewas not much, it is possible that permissible donations	 maybe out of all proportion and may thus result in reducing theavailable(1)  [1059] 2 S.C.R. 925.22170surplus	 from which low paid workmen are entitled to  bonus.We are therefore of opinion that though the law or the rulesof the company may permit the appellant to pay such  amountsas  donations  to  political funds, this  is  not  a  properexpense	 to  be	 deducted when	working	 out  the  availablesurplus	 in  the  light	 of the	 Full  Bench  formula.	 Thetribunal's decision therefore on this point must be upheld.The second contention of the appellant relates to  deductionof  what it calls extraneous income.  This matter  has	beenconsidered  by this Court in The Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd.  v.Ite  Workmen  and  Others (1) and what we  have	 to  see  iswhether	 in accordance with the decision in that  case,	 theappellant's   claim   for  deducting  certain	amounts	  asextraneous  income  is	correct.  Learned  counsel  for	 theappellant  has pressed four items in this  connection.	 Thefirst  item relates to a sum of Rs. 3.47 lacs.	It  is	saidthat  this  was	 not the income of the	year  and  thereforeshould	not have been taken into account in arriving at	 thegross profits.	The exact position with respect to this itemis  not	 clear	and  in any case  learned  counsel  for	 theappellant  appearing before the tribunal conceded  that	 theamount	could not be deducted from the profits.	 In view  ofthat  concession we are not prepared to allow the  deductionof  this amount as extraneous income.  The second item is  asum  of	 Rs. 1.76 lacs in respect of the  rebate  earned  oninsurance by the appellant with other companies by virtue ofits holding principal agency.  Obviously this is part of theinsurance  business  of the appellant and the work  in	thisconnection  is entirely handled by the insurance  departmentof  the	 appellant; as such the tribunal was  right  in	 notallowing  this amount as extraneous income.  The third	itemis  a  sum of Rs. 3-33 lacs being gain on  foreign  exchangetransactions.	These  transactions are carried	 on  in	 thenormal course of business of the appellant.  As the tribunalhas  rightly  pointed out, if there had been loss  on  thesetransactions  it  would have certainly gone  to	 reduce	 thegross profit,%; if there is a profit it has to be taken intoaccount as(1)[1960] 1 S.C.R. 1.171it  has arisen out of the normal business of the  appellant.The tribunal was therefore right in not allowing this amountas  extraneous income.	The last item is a sum of  Rs.	9.78lacs being commission on transactions by government agenciesand  other organisations with manufacturers  abroad  direct.It  seems that the appellant is the sole agent in  India  ofcertain foreign manufacturers and even when transactions aremade  direct with the manufacturers the appellant gets	com-mission	 on such transactions.	The tribunal has  held	thatthough	the transactions were made direct with	the  foreignmanufacturers, the respondents were entitled to ask that thecommission  should  be taken into account  inasmuch  as	 therespondents  serviced  the goods and did  other	 work  whichbrought such business to the appellant.	 It seems that thereis  no	direct evidence whether these  particular  goods  onwhich this commission was earned were also serviced free  bythe  appellant	like other goods sold by it  in	 India.	  Weasked  learned counsel for the parties as to what the  exactposition  was in the matter of free service to	such  goods.The  learned counsel however could not agree as to what	 wasthe exact position.  It seems to us that if these goods	 arealso  serviced	free or for charges but in the same  way  asother goods sold by the appellant in India, the	 respondentsare entitled to ask that the income from commission on thesegoods should be taken into account.  As however there is  nodefinite evidence on the point we cannot lay down that	suchcommission  must always be taken into account.	At the	sametime, so far as this particular year is concerned we have totake this amount into account as the appellant whose duty itwas to satisfy the tribunal that this was extraneous  incomehas failed to place proper evidence as to servicing of thesegoods.	 A claim of this character must always be proved  tothe  satisfaction of the tribunal.  In the circumstances  wesee no reason to interfere with the order of the tribunal sofar as this part of its order is concerned.Two other points have been urged on behalf of the172appellant  with respect to the interest allowed	 on  capitaland on working capital.	 The tribunal has allowed the  usualsix  per  cent	on  capital and four  per  cent	 on  workingcapital.  The appellant claimed interest at a higher rate inboth  cases.   We agree with the tribunal that there  is  nospecial	 reason	 why  any higher rate of  return  should  beallowed to the appellant.This  brings  us to the objections raised on behalf  of	 therespondents.  The main objection is to a sum of Rs. 4.4 lacsallowed	 by the tribunal as income-tax, which is said to  bewith respect to the previous year.  It appears that there isa  difference between the accounting year of  the  appellantand  the financial year.  In the particular year in  disputethere  was an increase in the rate of tax which resulted  inextra  payment which had to be paid in this year.  In  thesespecial circumstances, therefore, the tribunal allowed	thisamount and we see no reason to disagree.Next it is urged that the tribunal had allowed a sum of	 Rs.4.76  lacs  for	 making provision for gratuity	as  a  priorcharge.	  This	is obviously incorrect, as  this  Court	 haspointed	 out  in the Associated Cement Companies'  case	 (1)that  no  fresh items of prior charge can be  added  to	 theFull-Bench  formula, though at the time of  distribution  ofavailable  surplus such matters, as provision  for  gratuityand debenture redemption fund, might be taken into  account.This disposes of the objections relating to the accounts.Two   other  points  have  been	 urged	on  behalf  of	 therespondents.  They are with respect to (1) salesmen and	 (2)apprentices.  The tribunal has excluded these two categoriesfrom the award of bonus made by it.  The respondents contendthat they should also have been included.  We are of opinionthat the decision of the tribunal in this behalf is correct.So far as salesmen are concerned, the tribunal has  examinedthe  relevant decisions of other tribunals and has  come  tothe  conclusion	 that salesmen who are given  commission  onsales  are  not	 treated on par with other  workmen  in	 thematter	of bonus.  It has also been found that the  clericalwork done by salesmen is small and incidental to their	dutyas such; salesmen have(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.173therefore been held not to be workmen within the meaning  ofthe  Industrial Disputes Act.  The tribunal has pointed	 outthat  the  commission on an average works out at  about	 Rs.1,000 per mensem in the case of salesmen and therefore theirtotal emoluments are quite adequate.  Besides, the  salesmenbeing paid commission on sales have already taken a share inthe  profits of the appellant on a fair basis and  thereforethere  is no justification for granting them  further  bonusout  of	 the  available	 surplus of  profits.	As  for	 theapprentices, the tribunal has held that there is a  definiteterm  of  contract between them and the appellant  by  whichthey  are  excluded  from getting bonus.   Besides,  as	 theappellant  has	pointed	 out,  the  apprentices	 are  merelylearning   their  jobs	and  the  appellant  has  to   incurexpenditure on their training and they hardly contribute  tothe  profits  of the appellant.	 The view  of  the  tribunaltherefore with respect to apprentices also is correct.We  now	 turn  to  calculation	of  the	 available   surplusaccording   to	the  decision  in  the	 Associated   CementCompanies' case (1).  The gross profit found by the tribunalwill  stand  in view of what we have said  with	 respect  tovarious	 items	challenged by either party.   The  chart  ofcalculation will be as follows:-					       in Lacs	  Gross profits			    Rs. 109.97Less depreciation				  3.28Balance						106.69Less income-tax @ 51.15 per cent.	       54.20Balance						 52.49Less dividend tax, wealth tax etc.		 7.50Balance						 44.99Less return on capital at6 per cent.				     13.20.Balance						 31.79Less return on working capital at4 per cent.					  1.66Available surplus			      30.13.(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 925.174Out  of	 this, the tribunal has allowed five  months'  basicwages  as  bonus to the respondents which works out  at	 Rs.16.80 lacs.  In the circumstances it cannot be said that theaward  of  the tribunal is not justified.  We do  not  thinkthat we would be justified in giving anything more than whatthe  tribunal  has  awarded, because the  appellant  has  toprovide	 for  a fund for gratuity, for it is a	new  concernwhich took over the old employees of another concern when itwas  started  and  has	thus  a	 greater  liability  towardsgratuity than otherwise would be the case.  We are thereforeof  opinion that the tribunal's award of five months'  basicwages  as  bonus for the year in dispute should	 stand.	  Wetherefore dismiss both the appeals.  In the circumstances wepass no order as to costs.		     Appeals dismissed.
