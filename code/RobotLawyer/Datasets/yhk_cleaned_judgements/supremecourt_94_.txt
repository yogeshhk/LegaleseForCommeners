Both the Superintendent of sales-tax and	 theDeputy	Commissioner  of  sales-tax,  Bihar,  overruled	 theobjection of the appellants, and following a previous rulingof  the	 Board of Revenue of Bengal in a case known  as	 theBengal	Timber Case (61 of 1952) held the appellants  liableto  pay the tax.  The appellants paid the tax  demanded	 butfiled  an application in revision to the Board	of  Revenue,claiming  a constitutional exemption from tax on every	saleeffected  by them as a result of which goods were  deliveredoutside	 the  State of Bihar-whether the  delivery  was	 forconsumption  in	 the State of first delivery  or  not.	 TheBoard passed the following order on the revision petition."  As regards the admitted despatches of the  goods  outsidethe   State   after  the  26th	January,  1950,	  when	 theConstitution  came into force, the learned lower  court	 hasbeen  guided  by  the decision of the Board  in	 the  BengalTimber Case (No. 61 of 1952).  But this ruling of the  Boardstands superseded by the subsequent decision of the  SupremeCourt in the United Motors Case According to the decision ofthe  Supreme Court, no tax could be levied on despatches  tothe  places outside the state after the 26th January,  1950,and  on this point the petitions are allowed, and the  salestax  officer  directed	to recalculate	the  amount  of	 taxpayable by the assessee ".The appellants taking the above order to be in their  favourclaimed refund of the tax already paid by them and the salestax authorities contested the position and claimed that theywere bound to refund the tax only on those sales wherein thegoods  were delivered outside the State for  consumption  inthe  State  of first delivery.	 The  department  thereaftersought clarification of the above order.  The Board  refusedto  clarify or explain its order and passed an order  sayingthat " no further clarification was really required in	viewof  the	 specific reference to the judgment of	the  SupremeCourt  in  the	United	Motors Case  ".	 Thereafter  as	 theauthorities  still refused to refund the balance of the	 taxthe appellants filed two applications in the High Court	 forthe  issue of a writ of mandamus to compel the refund.	 TheHigh  Court  held that the Board's decision  that  sales  inwhich  the  goods  were	 delivered  outside  the  State	 forconsumption, not in the State of first delivery but in otherStates	were also exempted from tax, was wrong and that	 theappellants  were  not  entitled to a writ  of  mandamus	 forenforcing a wrong order.  On appeal by special leave,Held, that the proper construction of the Board's orders wasthat the sales tax officer was directed to decide the reliefthat108should	 be   given  to	 the  assessee	on   the   officers'interpretation	of the decision of this Court in the  UnitedMotors Case.  The Board did not determine the effect of thatjudgment  and  did not decide that every sale in  which	 thegoods were delivered outside the State of Bihar was exemptedfrom liability to tax.The principle that a subordinate tribunal should not  refuseto  carry  out	the directions of a  superior  tribunal	 wastherefore not applicable to the instant case.Bhopal	Sugar Mills v. Commissioner of Income-tax, [1961]  1S.C.R. 474, held inapplicable.The  United Motors Case merely decided that sales  in  whichgoods  were delivered outside the State for  consumption  inthe State of first delivery would fall under the Explanationto  Art. 286(1) of the Constitution and would  therefore  beexempted from tax liability, but it did not deal with  othersales	in   which  the	 goods	thus  delivered	  were	 forconsumption, not in the State of first delivery but in otherstates.	  Such	sales  would on the order of  the  Board  ofRevenue which was binding on the appellant be liable to	 taxin  accordance	with the previous decision of the  Board  ofRevenue in the Bengal Timber Case.State  of  Bombay v.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyAYYANGAR J.-These two appeals are from a common judgment  ofthe  High  Court  of Patna dated October  5,  1956,  in	 twopetitions  under Art. 226 of the Constitution and have	beenfiled  pursuant to a certificate granted by the	 High  Courtunder Art. 132.The  Tobacco Manufacturers (India) Ltd., the  appellants  inthe above appeals are an incorporated company  manufacturingcigarettes  and tobacco in their factory at Monghyr  in	 theState of Bihar, and these109appeals	 are  concerned	 with the legality of  the  levy  ofsales-tax under the Bihar Sales Tax Act (hereafter  referredto  as	the  Act)  on the appellants  in  respect  of  saleseffected  during  the financial years 1949-50 and  1950	 51.The  point urged in these appeals is a very narrow  one	 andrelates	 to the proper construction to be placed on  certainorders	of the Board of Revenue passed in regard to the	 taxproperly leviable for these two years.The  facts  relevant  to this point are	 briefly  these	 Theassessment  of	the  appellants	 for  both  the	 years	 wascompleted  by the Superintendent of Sales Tax,	Monghyr,  onMay  7, 1952, and the total tax liability was determined  inthe sum of Rs. 6,44,940-2-6 and Rs. 7,46,876-1-3 for the twoassessment  years 1950-51 and 1951-52 respectively.   Beforethe  assessing	officer, the appellants contended  that	 allsales effected by them as a direct result of which the goodswere delivered outside the State of Bihar were exempted fromtax  liability	under Art. 286(1)(a)  of  the  Constitution.This  objection	 was overruled, the reason  assigned  being,that the sales were completed in Bihar, and that the  entireturnover  of the appellants was therefore subjected  to	 taxunder the Act.	In taking this view the assessing  authorityfollowed  a previous ruling of the Board of Revenue  of	 theState  in  the	Bengal Timber case (Case 61  of	 1952).	  Anappeal	preferred to the Deputy Commissioner of	 Sales	Tax,Bihar,	by the appellants was dismissed on October 8,  1952,on the same grounds.The appellants paid the tax demanded for both the years	 andinvoked the revisional jurisdiction of the Board of Revenue.In their petitions to the Board the appellants pointed	out,that  the sales of goods delivered for	consumption  outsidethe  State  of Bihar which involved a tax liability  of	 Rs.1,23,813-0-2  in the earlier year and Rs.  7,10,185-12-0  inthe later year were made up of two types of transactions:(a)  those  in	which  the goods  thus	delivered  were	 forconsumption  in	 the  State  of	 first	delivery  or   firstdestination,(b)  those in which the goods thus delivered were110for consumption, not in the State of first delivery but	 in.other States.(These	two  classes  would be	referred  to  hereafter	 forconvenience  as	 typo (a) and type (b)	respectively).	 Theappellants  claimed that on the proper construction of	Art.286(1) & (2) they were entitled to have both these types  ofsales excluded from their taxable turnover.  By the date  ofthe hearing of these petitions by the revisional  authority,this  Court had rendered the decision in State of Bombay  v.United	Motors	(India) Ltd. and Others (1)  expounding	 thescope  of the explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) and	 its  inter-relation  to the exemption under Art. 286(2), and  naturallythis decision was brought to the attention of the member  ofthe  Board  at the hearing.  Without examining	whether	 thedecision  cited did or did not cover both the two (a) &	 (b)types of sales effected by the appellants, the Board  passedon August 28, 1953, a laconic order in these terms:"The two points urged in this Court were among those  pointsurged in the Lower Court and they are-(i)  No tax should have been levied on the Company's canteensales.(ii) that  despatches outside the State for  consumption  inother States should not have been taxed for the period afterthe Constitution came into force.As  regards the admitted despatches of goods out.  side	 theState  after the 26th January, 1950, when  the	Constitutioncame into force, the learned Lower Court has been guided  bythe  decision of the Board in the Bengal Timber	 case  (CaseNo.  61	 of  1952).  But this ruling  of  the  Board  standssuperseded  by the subsequent decision of the Supreme  Courtin  the United Motor's case,.  According to the decision  ofthe Supreme Court, no tax can be levied on despatches to theplaces outside the State after the 26th January, 1950 and onthis point the petition are allowed, and the(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1069.111sales-tax officer directed to recalculate the amount of	 taxpayable by the assessee ".Apparently  the appellants understood this order as  meaningthat all sales, whereunder goods were delivered outside	 theState, whether or not for consumption in the State of  firstdelivery (i.e., both types (a)&	 (b)) were exempted from thetax  levy.   The sales-tax authorities,	 however,  took	 theorder to mean that only those sales in which deliveries weremade outside the State for consumption in the State of firstdestination,  i. e., those of type (a) were intended  to  beexempted,  and these rival interpretations were put  forwardin the correspondence that passed between the appellants andthe   sales-tax	  authorities.	 The  appellants   made	  anapplication for the refund of the amount of tax attributableto  all the sales under which goods were  delivered  outsidethe  State,  but  the  tax  authorities	 sticking  to  theirinterpretation	of  the	 order of the  Board  and  of  theirinterpretation	of the decision of this Court in the  United Motors  case (1) refunded the tax collected on  the	 salesfalling within type (a) but refused to refund Rs. 20,923-15-2 for the 1st year and Rs. 1,29,823-5.0 for the later  year-these  amounts	representing the tax on sales of  type	(b).The appellants however persisted in pressing their claim forthe refund of these amounts also.In this state of affairs, the State of Bihar moved the Boardof Revenue to review its order dated August 28, 1953, or  atany rate clarify it so as to confine its operation to  salesfalling within type (a), urging that this would bring it  inaccord with the interpretation of Art. 286(1) by this  Courtin  the United Motors case (1).	 The appellants objected  tothe  jurisdiction  of  the Board of Revenue  to	 review	 itsprevious  decision  and	 on April 25, 1955,  it	 passed	 thefollowing order :"  These are what appear to be two  miscellaneous  petitionsfiled  on  behalf of the State of.   Bihar  seeking  certainclarifications	regarding the interpretation of the  Board'sorder  dated  28-8-1953 in Cases Nos. 514  of  1952.   Afterargument was heard it was conceded(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1069.112by both parties that there is no provision in the Act  underwhich the parties concerned may move the court to clarify orexplain the order passed, this function essentially being  amatter of legal advice.	 It was also agreed that no  furtherclarification  was really required in view of  the  specificreference to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the UnitedMotor's case.  The petitions are, therefore, rejected."If the order of the Board dated August 28, 1953, was laconicand ambiguous, the later order dated April 25, 1955, was  ifanything more obscure.	The appellants, however,  consideredit  an	order in their favour, because the petition  by	 theState  for clarification of the first order on the lines  ofthe  interpretation put upon it by the tax  authorities	 hadbeen dismissed, and when the refusal to refund the two	sumsof  tax	 referred to earlier was continued, they  filed	 twopetitions  in the High Court of Patna under Art. 226 of	 theConstitution  for the issue of writs of mandamus  to  compelthe refund of the tax on the principal ground that a duty todo  so	had  been  imposed by the orders  of  the  Board  ofRevenue, though the petition made an incidental reference tothe  appellants	 being entitled to such refund on  a  properconstruction of Art. 286(1) & (2) of the Constitution,	evenapart from the order of the Board of Revenue.The  learned  Judges of the High Court however in  the	mainconsidered  the question whether on a proper  interpretationof  the relevant Articles of the Constitution,	sales  underwhich goods were delivered outside Bihar but for consumptionnot  in	 the State of first delivery, were exempt  from	 taxunder the Bihar Sales Tax Act and decided the point  againstthe  appellants.   They next dealt with	 the  central  pointurged  in the petitions, viz., that the Board of Revenue  byits order dated August 28, 1953, had allowed the appellant'srevision  in regard to " the second point "  which  includedsales  of all categories whether or not for the	 purpose  ofconsumption in the State of first destination outside Bihar,and  directed the Sales-tax Officer to recompute the tax  byallowing this exemption, and that the officer was  thereforestatutorily bound to113give effect to the order of the Board, be the same right  orwrong, particularly when the Board refused to vary or modifyit so as to exclude particular types of sales from the scopeof  the	 exemption  when  moved	 to  do	 so  by	 the   StateGovernment.  In regard to this point after stating that	 theorders	of the Board of Revenue were ambiguous, the  learnedJudges	proceeded to answer the question on  the  assumptionthat  the  Board  of Revenue had  directed  the	 officer  torecompute  the tax on the basis that all the outside  sales-both the (a) and the (b) types were exempted from liability.The  learned Judges then pointed out that the order  of	 theBoard  would be clearly erroneous in regard to the (b)	typesales-and  that the petitioner in a writ of  mandamus  couldnot insist on a manifestly wrong order being enforced.	 Thepetitions were therefore dismissed.The  appellants applied to the High Court  for	certificatesunder  Arts. 132 and 133, but the learned Judges  granted  acertificate  under Art. 132 alone and it is on the  strengthof these certificates that the appeals are before us.The principal point that Mr. Chatterjee, learned Counsel forthe appellants, argued before us related to the duty of	 thetax  authorities to obey the orders of the Board of  Revenueand  give  effect to them, and he submitted  that  the	HighCourt erred in denying his clients the relief of mandamus onthe  ground  that that order was erroneous.  In	 support  ofthis  argument learned Counsel sought reliance on  a  recentdecision  of  this  Court in Bhopal  Sugar  Mills  V.	Com-missioner  of Income-tax (1) in which it was held that	whenan  order was made by a superior tribunal (in that case	 theIncome-tax  Appellate  Tribunal)  directing  the  Income-taxOfficer to compute the income of an assessee on a particularbasis  and  that  order had become  final,  the	 subordinateofficer had no right to disregard the direction, because  itwas  wrong  and that the High Court when approached  by	 theassessee for the issue of a writ of mandamus, was bound to(1) [1961] 1 S.C. R 47415114enforce	 the final order of the superior Tribunal and  couldnot  refuse to do so because it considered the order of	 theTribunal to be wrong.  This Court pointed out that when	 theorder  which  the Tribunal had jurisdiction to	pass  becamefinal, it bound all parties to it and its correctness  couldnot be challenged collaterally in proceedings for  enforcingthat  order.   The  attempt  of	 learned  Counsel  for	 theappellants  was to bring this case within the scope  of	 theabove ruling.The ratio of this decision is to be found in this passage:"  By that order the respondent virtually refused  to  carryout  the directions which a superior tribunal had  given  tohim  in	 exercise of its appellate powers in respect  of  anorder of assessment made by him.  Such refusal is in  effecta  denial of justice, and is furthermore destructive of	 oneof  the	 basic principles in the administration	 of  justicebased as it is in this country on a hierarchy of courts.  Ifa subordinate tribunal refuses to carry out directions givento  it	by  a  superior tribunal  in  the  exercise  of	 itsappellate   powers,  the  result  will	be  chaos   in	 theadministration	of justice and we have indeed found it	verydifficult  to appreciate the process of reasoning  by  whichthe  learned Judicial Commissioner while roundly  condemningthe  respondent for refusing to carry out the directions  ofthe  superior tribunal, yet held that no manifest  injusticeresulted from such refusal."To  attract the principle thus enunciated, it  is  necessarythat there should be an order of a superior tribunal  clear,certain	 and  definite	in  its terms,	and  with.  out	 anyambiguity, to which the subordinate authority or officer  towhom it is addressed, could give effect.  We are clearly  ofthe  opinion that the decision referred to cannot  apply  tothe situation in the present case.Taking the earlier order of the Board first-it is to put  itat the mildest ambiguous.  The Board referred to the  BengalTimber case which had been followed by the lower authoritiesin  disallowing the appellants' claim to exemption  to	boththe (a) and (b) type sales,involving out of State deliver. Areference was then115made to the decision of this Court in the State of Bombay v.United Motors (India) Ltd. and others (1) as superseding theprevious decision of the Board, adding that according to thedecision of this Court no tax could be levied on  despatchesoutside the State after the 26th January, 1950, and on	thatpoint  the petitions were allowed.  It will be noticed	thatthe  member did not set out the precise extent to which	 theruling of this Court superseded the previous decision of theBoard, and this was left in a state of uncertainty.  It	 wassuggested  by  learned Counsel for the appellants  that	 Mr.Bakshi, the member of the Board, drew no distinction betweensales  of type (a) or (b), and bad included both of them  asfalling within a single category of sales in which  deliveryhad  taken place outside the State for consumption in  otherStates,	 and for that reason we should hold that the  memberhad  rightly or wrongly treated the decision in	 the  UnitedMotors'	 case  as  applicable to all such  sales.   We	findourselves unable to agree in this construction of the order.We  cannot  presume  that  Mr. Bakshi  did  not	 peruse	 thejudgment  in the United Motors' case when he referred to  itin his order, nor that he did not acquaint himself with	 theterms	of  the	 Explanation  to  Art.	286(1)(a)   of	 theConstitution,  the  scope  and	significance  of  which	 wasanalysed  and  elaborated in that decision.  We	 are  ratherinclined  to  agree with the construction which	 the  memberhimself put on this order in April, 1955, that he left it tothe  Sales-tax Officer to decide for himself the  relief  towhich  the  appellants	were  entitled	on  that   officer'sinterpretation	of  the judgment of this Court.	 It  may  bethat this was not a satisfactory method of disposing of	 therevision petition-leaving the point which arose for decisionby the member of the Board of Revenue, to be decided by	 theSales-tax  Officer, but we are now only concerned  with	 thesimple question whether Mr. Bakshi had or had not determinedthe true scope and effect of the judgment of this Court	 anddecided	 it as meaning that all sales as a result  of  whichgoods were delivered outside the State(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 1069.116of Bihar were within the Explanation and so were exempt fromthe  tax  liability.  Notwithstanding the  cryptic  languageused  by  the  Member of the Board, we are  clearly  of	 theopinion	 that  he  did not intend to decide  this  point  infavour	of  the appellants in the  manner contended  for  bythem.It  is now common ground that when the Board of Revenue	 wasapproached by the State Government to review or clarify thisorder,	Mr.  Bakshi,  by his order  dated  April  25,  1955,expressed  himself  as having decided earlier  that  he	 haddirected  the  sales-tax  officer  to  give  effect  to	 thejudgment  of  this Court in the United Motors case  and	 haddone  nothing further.	Learned Counsel for  the  appellantsstrongly  pressed  before us that the member  of  the  Boardhaving accepted the preliminary objection that there was  noprovision  in  the  Bihar Sales-tax Act	 by  which  a  partyconcerned  might  move the Board to clarify or	explain	 theorder, he had no jurisdiction to effect any clarification ofhis  previous order and that whatever was said by the  Boardon  the	 second	 occasion could not be held  to	 modify	 theearlier	 order or deny the appellants such benefits as	weregranted	 to  them by the earlier order of August  28,  1953.But  as	 against this, it has to be noted  that	 before	 theBoard  both the parties, i.e., the State Government as	wellas  the appellants-agreed that clarification was not  neededbecause	 " of the specific reference to the judgment of	 theSupreme	 Court	in  the	 United	 Motors	 case  ".  As	thisobservation was embodied in the later order with the consentof both the parties, we consider that it is too late now forthe  appellants	 to raise any technical	 objection  to	thissentence  being given effect to.  In view, however,  of	 theconclusion  that we have reached as to the  construction  ofthe  earlier  order of August, 1953, it	 is  unnecessary  topursue the matter any further.If, therefore, as a result of the order or orders passed  bythe Board, the sales-tax officer was directed to give effectto the judgment of this Court in the United Motors case,  itfollowed that the interpretation of the judgment was left tothat  officer.	We have, already pointed out that to such  asituation the principle of117the  decision  of  this	 Court	in  Bhopal  Sugar  Mills  v.Commissioner  of Income Tax (1) is inapplicable.   We  mightalso  point  out that even if the decision applied  and	 theHigh Court issued an order in the nature of mandamus to	 thesales-tax  officer,  it	 could	only  take  the	 form  of  adirection  to  effect the reassessment in the light  of	 thedecision in the United Motors case (2)-an order which  wouldleave the appellants in the same position in which they	 nowfind themselves without such an order by the High Court.The  next question for consideration is whether on a  properconstruction  of the decision in the United Motors case	 (2)the  exclusion of type (b) sales from those  exempted  underArt. 286(1) was erroneous.  Mr. Chatterjee, learned  Counselfor  the appellants sought to establish that this Court	 haddecided	 in  the United Motors case three points:  (1)	thatsales  as a result of which goods were delivered in a  Statefor  consumption  in  such State, i.e.,	 the  sales  fallingwithin	the  Explanation  to Art.  286(1)  were	 fictionallyinside that State for all purposes and so within the  taxingpower  of the State in which such delivery took	 place,	 (2)that  sales which by the fiction created by the	 Explanationwere inside a particular State, were " outside "  all  otherStates,	 and  so  exempt from tax levy	by  all	 such  otherStates,	 (3) that further and beyond' this, all sales  whichdid  not satisfy the terms of the Explanation but  in  whichgoods were delivered outside the State in which title passedwere " outside sales " over which no State would have  powerto  levy a tax.	 In other words, the argument was that	thisCourt  had  laid  down that every sale which was  not  "  anExplanation  sale  " and therefore not an "  inside  sale  "within	a  particular State was an " outside sale"  for	 allStates	and therefore exempt from the levy of  sales-tax  byevery State in India.  In support of this submission learnedCounsel	 relied on a passage in the judgment of the  learnedChief Justice at page 1081 of the Re. port which ran:"...............  The  authors of the  Constitution  had  todevise a formula of restrictions to be imposed on the State-power of taxing sales or purchases involving(1) [1961] 1 S.C.R 474 (2) [1953] S.C.R 1069118inter-State  elements  which  would  avoid  the	 doubts	 anddifficulties  arising out of the imposition of	salestax  onthe  same transaction by several Provincial Legislatures  inthe  country  before the commencement of  the  Constitution.This they did by enacting Clause (1)(a) with the Explanationand clause (2) of Article 286.	Clause (1)(a) prohibits	 thetaxation of all sales or purchases which take place  outsidethe  State  but a localised sale is a  troublesome  concept,for, a sale is a composite transaction involving as it	doesseveral	 elements  such as agreement to	 sell,	transfer  ofownership,  payment of the price, delivery of the goods	 andso    forth,   which   may   take   place    at	   differentplaces.....................  To	 solve	the  difficulty	  aneasily	applicable test for determining what is	 an  outsidesale had to be formulated, and that is what, in our opinion,the Explanation was intended to do.  It provides by means ofa  legal fiction that the State in which the goods  sold  orpurchased are actually delivered for consumption therein  isthe State in which the sale or purchase is to be  consideredto  have taken place, notwithstanding the property  in	suchgoods  passed  in another State............ An "  outside  "sale or purchase is explained by defining what is an  insidesale,  and why actual delivery and consumption in the  Stateare  made  the	determining factors in locating	 a  sale  orpurchase  will	presently appear.  The	test  of  sufficientterritorial  nexus was thus replaced by a simpler  and	moreeasily	workable test: Are the goods actually  delivered  inthe taxing State as a direct result of a sale or a purchase,for the purpose of consumption therein ? Then, such sale  orpurchase  shall be deemed to have taken place in that  Stateand  outside  all  other  States.   The	 latter	 States	 areprohibited  from  taxing the sale or purchase ;	 the  formeralone is left free to do so.  Multiple taxation of the	sametransaction by different States is also thus avoided."In  our	 opinion,  this passage explains the  scope  of	 theExplanation   and  deals  with	what  might  be	  termed   "Explanation  sales ". If there is a sale falling within	 theterms  of  the	Explanation, it is " inside"  the  State  ofdelivery-cum-consumption  and that State alone can levy	 thetax.  Such a sale is outside all other119States,	 which	are prohibited from taxing such	 a  sale  byreason	of  any territorial nexus however close	 or  cogent.The  passage  extracted, however, does not deal	 with  caseswhere the sale in question does not satisfy the requirementsof the Explanation leading to the fixation of the  fictionalsitus of the sale deter-  mining the State by which  the taxmight be levied.  Whether any and, if so, which is the Statewhich  can  levy  a  tax  on  a	 sale  not  covered  by	 theExplanation, is not dealt with by this decision at all.From  this it would follow that sales of type (a)  would  beexempt from the levy of tax under the Bihar Sales-Tax Act byreason	or  their being "inside" sales within the  State  ofdelivery-cum-consumption  and  therefore  being	 "  outside"sales quoad the State of Bihar.	 Sales of type (b), however,not  having  been dealt with by the decision in	 the  UnitedMotors case, it would follow that on the orders of the Boardof Revenue, the previous decision of the Board in the BengalTimber	case  would  have  still  held	the  field  and	 thetransactions would be liable to the levy of tax and the	 taxlevied	on those sales would continue to be valid.   LearnedCounsel	 for  the  appellants was  certainly  right  in	 hissubmission  that as the orders of the Board of	Revenue	 hadbecame	final as between the parties, the liability  to	 taxmust  be  determined on the basis of  these  orders-be	theyright  or  wrong.  It is therefore unnecessary	to  considerwhether, apart from the decision of this Court in the UnitedMotors case, the appellants would be entitled to any furtherrelief	on  the basis of any other decision  of	 this  Courtinterpreting Art. 286(1) & (2).As already stated, the appellants have already been  granteda  refund in regard to the tax collected in respect  of	 thesales  falling	within type (a).  As, in  our  opinion,	 theappellants  were not on the orders of the Board	 of  Revenueentitled  to  a refund of the tax  on  transactions  fallingwithin	type (b), the judgment of the High Court  dismissingtheir petitions is clearly right.  The appeals fail and	 aredismissed,  but in the circumstances of the case there	willbe no order as to costs.Appeals dismissed.120
