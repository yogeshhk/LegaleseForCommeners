The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySHAH,  J.-The  Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,  Delhi  Bench,stated	under  s.  66(1) of the Indian Income  Tax  Act	 thefollowing  question  for  decision  of	the  High  Court  ofJudicature at Chandigarh:"Whether  the assessee's receipts from consumers for  layingservice	 lines,	 (that	is,  not  distributing	mains)	weretrading	 receipts  and whether the profit  element  therein,viz.,  service connection receipts minus service  connectioncost was taxable income in the assessee's hands?"The High Court answered the question as follows:"......	  the  company's receipts from	the  consumers	 forlaying the service lines are trading receipts and958the  profit element therein being the difference  bet	weenthe  service connection receipts and the service  connectioncosts is taxable income in the hands of the company."With  certificate granted under s. 66A(2) of the Income	 TaxAct,  this  appeal is preferred by the	Hoshiarpur  ElectricSupply Company	hereinafter referred to as the assessee.The  assessee is a licensee of an  electricity	undertaking.In  the	 year of account, April 1, 1947March 31,  1948,	 theassessee  received  Rs. 12,530 for new	service	 connectionsgranted	 to  its customers.  Out of this amount,  Rs.  5,929were spent for laying the service lines, and Rs. 1,338	werespent  for  laying certain mains.  The	Income	Tax  Officertreated the entire amount of Rs. 12,530 as trading  receipt.In appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the	costincurred for laying service lines and mains was excluded andthe  balance was treated as taxable income.  In appeal,	 theAppellate  Tribunal  agreed  with  the	Appellate  AssistantCommissioner  and held that the service connection  receiptswere trading receipts and that the "profit element"  thereinwas  taxable  income  in the hands of the  assessee.   In  areference  under  s. 66(1) of the Income Tax Act,  the	HighCourt substantially agreed with the view of the Tribunal.The   assessee	 has  installed	 machinery   for   producingelectrical  energy and has also laid mains and	distributinglines for supplying it to its customers.  The assessee makesno  charge  to the consumers for laying	 service  lines	 notexceeding  100 ft. in length from its distributing  main  tothe  point  of	connection on  the  consumer's	property  inaccordance  with cl. 6(1)(b) of the Schedule to	 the  IndianElectricity  Act, 1910.	 But where the length of  a  serviceline to be installed exceeds 100 ft., the cost is charged atcertain rates by the assessee.	The charge consists  usuallyof cost of wiring copper as well as galvanised iron, serviceand  other  brackets, insulators, meter	 wiring,  poles	 andappropriate labour and supervision charges.  In the year  ofaccount, the assessee gave 229 new connections959and  received  Rs. 12,530 out of which Rs. 5,929  have	beenregarded  as  taxable  income.	 In  the  forms	 of  accountprescribed  under the Indian Electricity Rules framed  unders.  37	read with s. 11 of the Indian Electricity  Act,	 theassessee credited service connection receipts to the revenueaccount	 and debited the Inc, corresponding cost  of  layingservice	  lines	  to   the   capital   account.	   But	 theclassification	of the receipts in the form of	accounts  isnot of any importance in considering whether the receipt  istaxable as revenue.The assessee contended that the service lines when installedbecame	the property of the assessee, because they  were  inthe  nature of an extension of the  assessee's	distributingmains.	On behalf of the Revenue, it was urged relying	uponthe judgment of the High Court that the service lines  whichare paid for by the consumers do not become the property  ofthe  assessee.	We do not think that it is open to us in  anappeal	from an order under s. 66 of the Indian	 Income	 TaxAct  to	 enter	upon this question.  The  Tribunal  did	 notrecord	a finding on the question whether the  assessee	 wasthe owner of the service lines.	 Undoubtedly,  contributionswere  made by the consumers towards the cost of the  servicelines  installed by the assessee which exceeded 100  ft.  inlength.	  Normally,  a person who pays for  installation  ofproperty may be presumed to be the owner thereof; but such apresumption  cannot  necessarily  be made in  respect  of  aservice	 line,	which so long as it is	used  for  supplyingelectrical  energy remains an integral part of	the  distri-buting	mains of an electrical undertaking.  The High  Courtwas exercising advisory jurisdiction, and the question as towho  was  the  owner of the service lines  after  they	wereinstalled  could be adjudicated upon only by  the  Tribunal.It  was	 for the Tribunal to record its conclusion  on	thatquestion,  but	the  Tribunal has  recorded  none.   In	 ourjudgment, the High Court was in error in assuming to  itselfjurisdiction  substantially  appellate in character  and  inproceeding  to	decide the question as to ownership  of	 theservice lines which is a mixed question of law and fact,  onwhich the Tribunal has given no finding.960The assessee contended that the amount paid by the consumersfor  new  connections is capital receipt and not  liable  totax,  because  the amount is paid by the  consumers  towardsexpenditure to be incurred by	 the assessee in laying	 newservice	 lines-an  asset of a	    lasting character.	Thisquestion  falls to be determined in the light of the  natureof  the	 receipt irrespective of who remained owner  of	 thematerials  of  the  service  lines  installed  for  grantingelectrical connections to new customers.The assessee only spends a part of the amount received by itfrom  the consumers.  It is not clear from the statement  ofthe  case  whether amongst the 229  new	 connections  given,there  were  any which were of a length less  than  100	 ft.Payments  received  by the assessee must of  course  be	 forservice lines installed of length more than 100 ft., but  itis  not clear on the, record whether the expenditure of	 Rs.5,929 incurred by the assessee is only in respect of servicelines which exceeded 100 ft. in length or it is	 expenditureincurred in respect of all service lines.  It is however notdisputed  that	a  part	 of the	 amount	 received  from	 theconsumers  remains  with  the  assessee	 after	meeting	 theexpenses  incidental  to  the construction  of	the  servicelines.	 But  an  electric service  line  requires  constantinspection  and	 occasional  repairs  and  replacement	 andexpenses  in  this  behalf  have to  be	 undertaken  by	 theassessee.   The	 amount	 contributed  by  the  consumer	 forobtaining  a  new connection would of  necessity  cover	 allthose  services.  The amount contributed by the consumer  isin  direct recoupment of the expenditure for  bringing	intoexistence  an  asset  of a lasting  character  enabling	 theassessee  to  conduct its business of  supplying  electricalenergy.	 By the installation of the service lines, a capitalasset  is brought into existence.  The contribution made  bythe consumers is substantially as consideration for a  jointadventure;  the	 service  line	when  installed	 becomes  anappanage of the mains of the assessee, and by the provisionsof the Electricity Act, the assessee is obliged to  maintainit  in	proper	repairs for  ensuring  efficient  supply  ofenergy.	 The assumption made by the961Department  that  the excess remaining in the hands  of	 theassessee, after defraying the immediate cost of installationof  a service line must be regarded as a trading  profit  ofthe  company  is not correct.  The assessee  is	 undoubtedlycarrying  on the business of distributing electrical  energyto  the consumers.  Installation of service lines is not  anisolated or casual act; it is an incident of the business ofthe  assessee.	 But  if  the  amount  contributed  by	 theconsumers   for	  installation	of   what   is	 essentiallyreimbursement  of capital expenditure, the excess  remainingafter  expending the cost of installation out of the  amountcontributed  is not converted into a trading receipt.	Thisexcess-which is called by the Tribunal "profit	element"-wasnot  received in the form of profit of the business; it	 waspart of a capital receipt in the hands of the assessee,	 andit  was	 not  converted into a trading	profit	because	 theassessee  was  engaged in the business	of  distribution  ofelectrical energy, with which the receipt was connected.In  Commissioner of Income-tax v. Poona Electric Supply	 Co.Ltd. (1), it was held by a Division Bench of the Bombay HighCourt that the amount received from the Government of Bombayby  the Poona Electric Company in reimbursement of  expensesincurred  for  constructing new supply lines  for  supplyingenergy	to  new areas not previously served, was  a  capitalreceipt	 and  not  a trade receipt.   The  question  of	 thetaxability  of	the  "profit element"  in  the	contributionreceived  from the Government was not expressly	 determined;but  the  court	 in that case held that	 the  entire  amountreceived  by the Poona Electric Company from the  Governmentas contribution was a capital receipt.In  Monghyr  Electric  Supply Co. Ltd.	v.  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax,  Bihar  and	 Orissa (2), it was  held  that	 theamount paid by consumers of electricity for meeting the costof service connections was a capital receipt in the hands ofthe electricity undertaking and not revenue receipt and	 thedifference between the amount received on account of serviceconnection charges and(1) [1946] 14 I.T.R, 622.(2) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 15.962the  amount  immediately  not expended was  not	 taxable  asrevenue.The receipts though related to the business of the  assesseeas distributors of electricity were not inciden t nor in thecourse	of the carrying on of the assessee's business;	theywere receipts for bringing into existence capital of lastingvalue.	 Contributions	were not made  merely  for  servicesrendered and to be rendered, but for installation of capitalequipment under an agreement for a joint venture.  The totalreceipts  being	 capital  receipts, the	 fact  that  in	 theinstallation   of  capital,  only  a  certain	amount	 wasimmediately  expended, the balance remaining in hand,  couldnot  be	 regarded  as  profit in the  nature  of  a  tradingreceipt.   On  that view of the case, in our  judgment,	 theHigh  Court was in error in holding that the excess of	the,receipts  over	the  amount  expended  for  installation  ofservice lines by the assessee was a trading receipt.The appeal is allowed and the question submitted to the HighCourt is answered in the negative.  The assessee is entitledto its costs in this court as well as in the High Court.				       Appeal allowed.
