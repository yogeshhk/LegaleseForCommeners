It is  well  settledthat in construing the provisions of a welfare	legislation,such  as  the Act in question which has for its	 object	 thepreservation  of the  health, safety and  welfare  of  theworkmen,   courts  should  apply  the  rule  of	  beneficentconstruction  and moreover, ss. 78 and 84 of the Act put  itbeyond	doubt that S. 79(1) is not intended  to	 standardiseannual leave with wages by providing the maximum.Rightly construed S. 78(1) of the Act not only protects pastlaws,  awards, agreements and contracts but also those	thatare  to	 come  into existence in the  future  and  does	 notprohibit  a more generous agreement than that prescribed  byS. 79(1).Likewise the scope of s. 84 of the Act which, in  empoweringthe State to exempt a factory from all or any provisions  ofCh.  VIII  of the Act, contemplates  better  amenities	thanthose  guaranteed  by  the Chapter,  cannot  be	 limited  tobenefits existing at the date of the Act but must also applyto  future  benefits  which an employer	 may  grant  to	 hisemployees.Consequently, in a case where the Industrial Tribunal, on  aconsideration of awards and agreements between employers andemployees  in comparable concerns, awarded annual  leave  inexcess of what is prescribed by S. 79(1),Held, that the award was not open to challenge.Held,  further, that the distinction generally made  betweenoperatives doing manual work and clerical and other staff isperfectly justifiable and so the award of privilege leave tothe clerical staff could not be said to be discriminatory.Although  the  Industrial Tribunals  in	 awarding  privilegeleave  or sick leave must not fail to consider their  effecton  production	and so on the interest of the  community  ingeneral,  this Court would be reluctant under Art.   136  ofthe  Constitution  to  interfere with an  award	 unless	 itsprovisions  are unsustainable on any reasonable grounds	 andmake  a	 violent  departure  from  the	practice  and  trendprevailing in comparable concerns.38298JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 475 of 1960.Appeal by special leave from the Award dated March 31, 1960,of  the Industrial Tribunal, Bombay, in Reference  (I.	 T.)No. 227 of 1959.M....C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, G. B. Pal	 andJ. B. Dadachanji, for the appellant.I. N. Shroff, for the respondents.1960.  December 15.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyGAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-This appeal by special leave arises	froman  industrial	dispute between the appellant,	the  AlembicChemical  Works Co. Ltd., and the respondents, its  workmen.The  said  dispute related to a single demand  made  by	 therespondents with regard to leave.  This demand consisted  ofthree  parts,  (a)  one month's privilege  leave  with	fullsalary and dearness allowance on completion of eleven monthsservice	 in  a	year with a right  to  accumulate  upto	 sixmonths,	 (b)  one month's sick leave with  full	 salary	 anddearness  allowance for each year of service with  right  toaccumulate  for the entire period of service, and (c)  everyworkman	 should be entitled to take leave in  proportion  tothe  number of days he is in service of the company  at	 thetime  of  his application for the same.	  This	dispute	 wasreferred by the Government of Bombay for adjudication beforethe Industrial Tribunal under s. 10(1)(d) of the  IndustrialDisputes Act XIV of 1947.The  Tribunal  considered  the	contentions  raised  by	 theappellant  against  the	 respondents'  demands,	 took	intoaccount	 awards	 or agreements between employers  and  theiremployees  in  comparable concerns and made its	 award.	  Inregard	to  privilege leave the Tribunal  has  ordered	thatleave should be granted to the staff members covered by	 thereference as follows:Privilege leave upto 3 ... 16 days as at presentcompleted years of service	per year.Up to 9 completed years...     22 days per year. And thereafter		   ...	One month for every			      11 months of service.299The award allows accumulation of privilege leave upto  threeyears.	As regards sick leave, the Tribunal has ordered thatthe  appellant should give its staff covered by the  presentaward  15  days	 sick  leave in a year	with  full  pay	 anddearness allowance with a right to accumulate upto 45  days.It  has also directed that no medical certificate should  bedemanded if sick leave for three days or less is asked	for.In  regard to the third item of demand concerning  leave  inproportion the Tribunal has made appropriate direction whichit is unnecessary to set out for the purpose of this appeal.Before	the  Tribunal  the main	 contention  raised  by	 theappellant was in regard to the propriety and  reasonablenessof  the demand and in regard to the practice  prevailing  incomparable  concerns.	Before	this  Court,  however,	 theprovision made by the award in regard to privilege leave hasbeen attacked mainly on the ground that the Tribunal had  nojurisdiction  to  make such an award having  regard  to	 theprovisions of s. 79 of the Factories Act, 1948 (63 of  1948)(hereafter  called the Act).  It is urged that s. 79 of	 theAct  has made exhaustive and self-contained provisions	withregard	to  the granting of annual leave with wages  to	 theemployees to whom the said Act applies, and the effect of s.79  is to introduce standardisation in the matter of  leave;which  means  neither  the  employer  voluntarily,  nor	  anIndustrial  Tribunal  by  its award, can add  to  the  leaveprescribed by the, said section.  In the matter of leave  s.79  is a complete code, and no additions to the	 said  leavecan  be	 made either by a contract or by an  award.   It  iscommon ground that the respondents are governed by the	pro-visions	 of the Act.  This point was not raised	 before	 theTribunal,  but	since it is a point of law which  arises  onadmitted  facts	 we  have permitted  the  learned  Attorney-General to argue it before us. The Act was first enacted in 1934 as Act 25 of 1934.  Sincethen it has been amended from time to time.  Its main objectis  to	consolidate and amend the law regulating  labour  infactories.   For the purpose of determining  which  concernsand which employees300would  be  governed  by	 the Act  s.  2(m)  and	 (1)  define"factory"  and "worker" respectively.  Even a broad view  ofthe scheme of the Act and a perusal of its provisions  wouldclearly	 indicate that the Act is a beneficent	measure	 andits  policy  is	 to  make  reasonable  provisions  for	 thepreservation  of  health of the workmen,  their	 safety	 andtheir  welfare.	 With that object in view, the Act has	madeprovisions  for the regulation of working hours	 of  adults,has regulated the employment of young persons, and has	alsoprovided  for annual leave with wages to the  workmen.	 Theamendments  made in the relevant provisions of the Act	fromtime  to  time indicate that the Act has been  pursuing	 itsbeneficent  policy slowly but steadily and is attempting  toprovide for the workmen better and larger amenities in theiremployment.   It is in the light of this obvious policy	 andobject of the Act that we have to decide the question raisedbefore us by the appellant.Section 79(1) occurs in Chapter VIII which deals with annualleave with wages.  It provides thus:	      "79.  (1).  Every worker who has worked for  a	      period of 240 days or more in a factory during	      a	 calendar year shall be allowed	 during	 the	      subsequent calendar year, leave with wages for	      a number of days calculated at the rate of-	      (i)...if	an adult, one day for  every  twenty	      days  of	work  performed by  him	 during	 the	      previous calendar year;	      (ii)..if	a child, one day for  every  fifteen	      days   of	 work performed by  him	 during	 the	      previous calendar year.	      Explanation  1--For the purpose of  this	sub-	      section-	      (a)   any	 days  of lay off, by  agreement  or	      contract or as permissible under the  standing	      orders;	      (b)   in	  the  case  of	 a  female   worker,	      maternity	 leave	for any number of  days	 not	      exceeding twelve weeks; and	      (c)...the	 leave earned in the year  prior  to	      that in which the leave is enjoyed;	      shall be deemed to be days on which the worker	      301	      has worked in a factory for the computation of	      the  period of 240 days or more, but he  shall	      not earn, leave for these days."This  section  has  11 other sub-sections  which  deal	withdifferent aspects and make relevant provisions in regard  toannual leave with wages.  It is not disputed that the  awardpurports to make provisions for privilege leave in excess ofthe  annual leave sanctioned by s. 79.	Can  the  IndustrialTribunal  direct  the appellant to provide  such  additionalprivilege  leave to its employees?; in other words, does  s.79 purport to standardise annual leave with wages so that nodeparture from the said standard is permissible either	way?The  appellant's contention is that except for	pre-existingawards, agreements, contracts or except for pre-existing lawno departure from the standardised provision is	 permissibleafter s. 79 was enacted.This argument raises the question of construing s. 79 in thelight  of the other relevant provisions of the Act.  It	 maybe conceded that the provisions made by s. 79 are elaborate,and  in	 that  sense may be treated  as	 self-contained	 andexhaustive.  It is also clear that s. 79(1) does not use theexpression "not more than or not less than" as it might havedone  if  the intention of the Legislature was to  make	 itsprovisions  correspond either to the minimum or the  maximumleave claimable by the employees; but even so, when s. 79(1)provides that every worker shall be allowed leave as thereinprescribed,  the  provision  prima  facie  sound,%  like   aprovision for the minimum rather than for the maximum  leavewhich may be awarded to the worker.  If the intention of theLegislature was to make the leave permissible under s. 79(1)the  maximum to which a workman would be entitled, it  wouldhave used definite and appropriate language in that  behalf.We  are, therefore, inclined to think that even on  a  plainconstruction of s. 79(1) it would be difficult to accede  tothe  argument  that it prescribes standardised	leave  whichinevitably would mean the maximum permissible until s. 79(1)itself is302Even  on  the  basis  that  s.	79(1)  is  capable  of	 theconstruction sought to be placed on it by the appellant, thequestion  would still remain whether the  Raid	constructionshould	be preferred to the alternative construction  which,as  we	have just indicated, is	 reasonably  possible.	 Theanswer	to  this question must be in the  negative  for	 tworeasons;  first,  having regard,to the	obvious	 policy	 andobject	 of  the  Act,	if  s.	79(1)  is  capable  of	 twoconstructions  that construction should be  preferred  whichfurthers the policy of the Act and is more beneficial to theemployees in whose interest the Act has been passed.  It  iswell settled that in construing the provisions of a  welfarelegislation courts should adopt what is sometimes  describedas  a beneficent rule of construction; but, apart from	thisgeneral	 consideration	about the policy and object  of	 theAct,  ss. 78 and 84 occurring in the same Chapter as  s.  79clearly	  indicate  that  s.  79(1)  is	 not   intended	  tostandardise leave provisions as contended by the  appellant,and  that is the second reason why the appellant's  argumentcannot be accepted.Let  us	 then  consider the provisions of  Bs.	78  and	 84.Section	 78(1) provides that the provisions of Chapter	VIIIshall  not operate to the prejudice of any right to which  aworker	may  be entitled under any other law, or  under	 theterms of any award, agreement or contract of service.  Thereis  a proviso to this sub-section which lays down that	whensuch  award, agreement or contract of service  provides	 forlonger annual leave with wages than provided in this Chapterthe  worker  shall be entitled only to	such  longer  annualleave.	 Section  78(2) exempts specified workers  from	 theoperation of Chapter VIII.  The first difficulty which	thissection	 raises	 against  appellant's argument	is  that  itundoubtedly recognises exceptions to the leave prescribed bys.   79(1).   It  is  well-known  that	standardisation	  ofconditions  of service in industrial adjudication  generallydoes  not  recognise or permit exceptions; if the  hours  ofwork  are standardised, for instance, or the  wage-structureis  standardised, it is intended to make hours of  work	 andwages uniform in the whose industry brought303under  the working of standardisation  Standardisation	thusinevitably  means  levelling  up of those  whose  terms	 andconditions   of	 service  were	less  favourable  than	 thestandardised  ones, and levelling down those of such  otherswhose  terms  and conditions were more favourable  than	 thestandardised  ones.  That being so, if s. 79(1) intended  tostandardise  annual leave with wages it would  normally	 nothave  made  provisions in regard to exceptions as  s.  78(1)obviously does.Besides,  the scope and extent of the exceptions  recognisedby   s.	 78(1)	are  decisively	 against   the	 appellant'sconstruction of s. 79(1).  The learned Attorney-General	 hasstrenuously contended that the saving  provision of s. 78(1)applies	  only	to  existing   law  and	  existing   awards,agreements  or	contracts of service; in  other	 words,	 hisargument is that the Legislature has deliberately decided toexcept	pre-existing arrangements and in that sense it is  adeparture from the usual concept of standardisation.  In ouropinion,  the  assumption  that	 s.  78(1)  is	confined  toexisting  arrangements is plainly inconsistent with  a	fairand  reasonable	 construction of the  said  provision.	Whens.78(1)	 refers	 to  any other law it could  not  have	beenintended  that	it  is	only  to  existing  laws  that	 thereference is made and that the idea underlying the provisionwas  that no law can be passed in future which would  grantmore generous leave to the employees.  Such a restriction onthe  legislative activities of the appropriate	Legislaturescannot	obviously have been intended.  If the  reference  tolaw is not confined only to existing law there is no  reasonwhy reference to any award, agreement or contract of serviceshould	be similarly circumscribed or limited.	We  feel  nodifficulty in holding that what s. 78(1) protects are  laws,awards,	 agreements or contracts of service which were	thenexisting  or which would come into existence later; that  isto say s. 78(1) does not affect preexisting arrangements anddoes  not also prohibit future arrangements which  would  bemore  generous	than s. 79(1).	A law may be  passed  makingmore generous provisions, or agreements or contracts may304be  entered  into or awards made with the same	result.	  Ifthat  be  the true position s. 78(1) clearly  negatives	 thetheory that s. 79(1) provides for standardisation of  annualleave with wages.The provisions of s. 84 would also lead to the same  result.Section	 84  provides  that where the  State  Government  issatisfied  that the leave rules applicable to workers  in  afactory	 provide benefits which in its opinion are not	lessfavourable than those for which Chapter VIII makes provisionit  may by written order exempt the factory from all or	 anyof the provisions of Chapter VIII subject to such conditionsas may be specified in the order.  Now, the power to  exemptfactories has to be exercised having regard to the effect ofthe  totality of the benefits which may be afforded  to	 theworkers by their respective factories.	This power to exemptalso   necessarily  postulates	the  existence	 of   betteramenities  than those guaranteed by Chapter VIII,  and	thatmeans  that if a factory provides better leave amenities  toits  employees, the State Government may in the interest  ofthe employees exempt the factory from the operation of	thisChapter.   The	scope  of s. 84, like the scope	 of  s.	 78,cannot be limited only to the more favourable benefits whichmay  be existing at the date when the Act was passed.	Whatis  true about the existing benefits would be  equally	trueabout  the benefits which may be granted by an	employer  tothe  employees in future.  Let us illustrate what  the	con-sequence  would be if the appellant's argument is  accepted.Take the case of an employer who has been exempted under  s.84 on the ground that the benefits of leave conferred by himon  his	 employees are more favourable to them.	 In  such  acase,  the  employer  may  make	 his  benefits	still	morefavourable  after  exemption  is accorded  to  him;  but  anemployer  who  has  already  not  provided  more  favourablebenefits would be effectively precluded from making any suchprovisions in future.  It is difficult to imagine that	sucha consequence could have been intended by the provisions  ofthis welfare legislation.305The   history  of  the	amendments  made  in  the   relevantprovisions  of the Act also indicates that the Act has	beengradually making more liberal provisions in' the interest ofworkmen	 to whom it applies.  In the original Act as it	 waspassed (25 of 1934) s. 34 provided for weekly holiday but noprovision was made for holidays with pay.  When the said Actwas amended by Act 3 of 1945, s. 49A which is equivalent  topresent	 s. 78(1) without the proviso was inserted;  and  s.49B  provided,	inter  alia,  that  every  worker  who	 hascompleted a period of twelve months continuous service in  afactory	 shall	be allowed during the subsequent  period  oftwelve	months holidays for a period of ten days.   That  ishow  provision	for  holidays  came  to	 be  made.   By	 the;'amending  Act 63 of 1948, s. 78 with the  present  provisowas  enacted;  and s. 79 made a provision for  annual  leavewith  wages.  While making provision for annual	 leave	withwages  the  section then prescribed a minimum of  ten  days;subsequently, by amending Act 25 of 1954, s. 79 as it standsat  present was enacted; and in s. 78 the word "annual"	 hasbeen  added to qualify leave in the proviso.  We  have	thusbriefly	 referred to some changes made in the Act from	timeto  time  in order to show that subsequent  amendments	havesought to make the provisions more liberal.There is one more point which may incidentally be  mentionedwhilst	we  are considering the amendments made in  the	 Actfrom time to time.  Section 49A which broadly corresponds tos.  78 of the present Act saved other laws and terms of	 anyaward,	agreement  or contract of service just as  s.  78(1)does.	Now, if the said section is construed on  the  lineswhich  the appellant wants us to construe s. 78(1) it  wouldonly  be  arrangements existing at the date  when  the	saidamending Act came into force on January 1, 1946, that  wouldbe protected and saved, and nothing that happened either  byway  of	 legislation  or  by  way  of  awards  or  contractssubsequent to the said date would attract the provisions  ofthe said s. 49A or s. 78 which subsequently took its  place.This obviously is not39306intended  by the Legislature which incidentally shows	thats.  78(1)  cannot be confined to  existing  arrangements  orlaws,  but takes within its sweep future  laws,	 agreements,contracts  or  awards.	 Therefore,  the  challenge  to	 thevalidity of the award based on the assumption that s.  79(1)provides  for standardised award of annual leave with  wagesfails.Then  it is urged that the provision made by the  award	 forprivilege   leave  introduces  discrimination  between	 theclerical   staff  covered  by  the  present  reference	 andoperatives  covered by the earlier awards made by  the	sameTribunal.   We were told that operatives had made a  similarclaim for privilege leave before the same Tribunal, and	 thesaid  claim  had been rejected.	 The argument  is  that	 theprovision  for	privilege leave made by	 the  present  awardwould  create  discontent  amongst the	operatives  to	whomsimilar	 leave	has  been denied,  and	that  would  disturbindustrial  peace.  We are not impressed by  this  argument.It  is	not  seriously	disputed  that	a  distinction	 hasgenerally  been made between operatives who do	manual	workand  clerical  and  other staff;  in  fact  the	 appellant'sstanding   orders   themselves	 make	different   relevantprovisions  for the two categories of its employees.  It  isalso not disputed that in practice such distinction is	madeby  comparable	concerns,  and	awards	based  on  the	samedistinction  are  generally  made  in  respect	of  the	 twoseparate categories of employees.  We are, therefore, unableto appreciate the argument that in granting privilege  leaveto the present staff the Tribunal has either overlooked	 itsearlier award or has made a decision which suffers from	 thevice   of  discrimination.   The  practice   prevailing	  incomparable  concerns  and the trend of awards both  seem  toshow  that a distinction is generally made between  the	 twocategories  of employees, and since the said distinction  isperfectly  justifiable	no question  of	 discrimination	 canarise.It  is	then  argued  that  making  liberal  provisions	 forprivilege  leave  and sick leave are really opposed  to	 themodern	trend  in industrial thought, and  so  such  liberalawards should be discouraged and corrected.307There is no doubt that when industrial adjudication seeks todo  social  justice it cannot ignore the needs	of  nationaleconomy;  and so in considering matters of leave, either  inthe  form  of privilege leave or sick leave,  the  Tribunalsshould not ignore the consideration that unduly generous  orliberal	  leave	 provisions  would  affect  production	 andobviously  production  of essential commodities	 is  in	 theinterest  of  not only the employers and the  employees	 butalso of the general community; but it is difficult for us toaccept	 the   argument	 that  we   should   make   suitablemodifications in the provisions made by the award in  regardto  privilege  leave  or  sick	leave.	 These	are  mattersprimarily  for	the  Industrial	 Tribunal  to  consider	 anddecide.	  The  Tribunal	 is more  familiar  with  the  trendprevailing  in	comparable concerns, and unless	 it  appearsthat  the  impugned provisions cannot be  sustained  on	 anyreasonable ground or that they mark a violent departure fromthe  prevailing practice or trend, we would be reluctant  tointerfere with the decision of the Tribunal.  After all,  indeciding what ,would be a reasonable provision for privilegeleave  or sick leave, the Tribunal has to take into  accountall  relevant factors and come to its own decision.   As  wehave  already  indicated, in making the	 present  award	 theTribunal  has  considered  previous  decisions	which	wererelevant  and prevailing agreements in comparable  concerns.We  have  carefully  considered the criticism  made  by	 thelearned Attorney-General against the provisions contained inthe  award,  but we are not satisfied that a case  has	beenmade out for interference in an appeal under Art. 136.The result is the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.308
