The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyWANCHOO,  J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in  anindustrial  matter.   It appears that  the  appellants	wereoriginally  in the service of the Scindia  Steam  NavigationCo. Ltd. (hereinafter called the Scindias).  Their  serviceswere transferred by way of loan to the Air Services of IndiaLimited	 (hereinafter referred to as the ASI).	The ASI	 wasformed in 1937 and was813purchased  by  the Scindias in 1943 and by 1946 was  a	fullsubsidiary  of the Scindias.  Therefore from 1946  to  about1951,  a  large number of employees of	the,  Scindias	weretransferred to the ASI for indefinite periods.	The Scindiashad  a	number	of subsidiaries and it	was  usual  for	 theScindias  to  transfer their employees to  their  subsidiarycompanies  and take them back whenever they found  necessaryto do so.  The' appellants who were thus transferred to	 theASI  were to get the same scale of pay as the  employees  ofthe  Scindias and the same terms and conditions	 of  service(including  bonus  whenever the Scindias paid  it)  were  toapply.	 The  Scindias retained the right  to  recall  theseloaned	employees and it is the case of the appellants	thatthey  were  entitled to go back to the Scindias if  they  sodesired.  Thus the terms and conditions of service of  theseloaned	employees  of  the ASI	were  different	 from  thoseemployees of the ASI who were recruited by the ASI itself.This   state  of  affairs  continued  till  1952  when	 theGovernment  of	India contemplated  nationalisation  of	 theexisting air lines operating in India with effect from	June1953 or thereabouts.  When legislation for this purpose	 wason  the	 anvil	the appellants felt  perturbed	about  theirstatus	in the ASI which was going to be taken over  by	 theIndian	 Air  Lines  Corporation  (hereinafter	called	 theCorporation), which was expected to be established after theAir Corporations Act, No. XXVII of 1953, (hereinafter calledthe Act) came into force.  They therefore addressed a letterto  the	 Scindias on April 6, 1953, requesting that  as	 theGovernment  of	India intended to nationalise  all  the	 airlines in India with effect from 1 June, 1953, or  subsequentthereto, they wanted to be taken back by the Scindias.On  April  24, the Scindias sent a reply to this  letter  inwhich  they pointed out that all persons working in the	 ASIwould  be governed by cl. 20 of the Air Corporation Bill  of1953,  when  the  Bill was enacted into law.   It  was	alsopointed	 out  that  this clause would  apply  to  all  thoseactually working with the ASI on103814the   appointed	 day  irrespective  of	whether	 they	wererecruited by the ASI directly or transferred to the ASI fromthe  Scindias or other associated concerns.  It was  furtherpointed out that if the loaned employees or others, employedunder  the  'ASI,  did	not  want  to  join  ,the   proposedCorporation  they would have the option not to do  so  underthe  proviso  to  cl. 20(1) of the 'Bill; but  in  case	 anyemployee  of  the ASI whether loaned or otherwise  made	 theoption	not to join the proposed Corporation,  the  Scindiaswould  treat  them as having resigned from service,  as	 theScindias could not absorb them.	 In that case such employeeswould be entitled only to the usual retirement benefits	 andwould	not  be	 entitled  to	retrenchment   compensation.Finally,  it was hoped that all those in the employ  of	 theASI,  whether  loaned or otherwise, having  been  guaranteedcontinuity  of employment in the new set-up would  see	thatthe  Scindias  would  not be burdened  with  surplus  staff,requiring  consequential  retrenchment of the same  or	morejunior personnel by the Scindias.On  April 29, 1953, a reply was sent by the union on  behalfof the appellants to the Scindias.  It was pointed out	thatthe loaned staff should not be forced to go to the  proposedCorporation without any consideration of their claim for re-absorption  into  the Scindias.	 It was suggested  that	 thematter	might be taken up with the Government of  India	 andthe  persons  directly recruited by the ASI  who  were	withother  subsidiary companies might be taken by  the  proposedCorporation in place of the appellants.	 It seems that	thissuggestion  was	 taken up with the Government of  India	 butnothing	 came  out of it, particularly because	the  personsdirectly  recruited by the ASI. who were employed  in  othersubsidiary companies did not want to go back to the ASI.In  the	 meantime,  the Scindias issued a  circular  on	 May6,1953,	 to  all the employees under the ASI  including	 theloaned	employees,  in which they pointed out that  all	 thepersons working with the ASI would be governed by cl.  20(1)when  the  Bill	 became law and would  be  absorbed  in	 theproposed Corporation, unless815they  took  advantage of the proviso to cl. 20(1).   It	 wasalso  pointed out that such employees as took  advantage  ofthe proviso to el. 20(1) would be treated as having resignedfrom  service  and  would be entitled  to  usual  retirementbenefits  as on voluntary retirement, and to  nothing  more.It  was also said that their conditions of service would  bethe  same  until  duly altered or amended  by  the  proposedCorporation.   The circular then dealt with certain  mattersrelating  to  provident fund with which we are	however	 notconcerned.It  appears that the Act was passed on May 28,	1953.	Sec.20(1)  of the Act, with which we are concerned, is in  theseterms:-"(1)  Every  officer or other employee of  an  existing	 aircompany	 (except a director, managing agent, manager or	 anyother  person entitled to manage the whole or a	 substantialpart  of  the business and affairs of the  company  under  aspecial	 agreement)  employed by that company prior  to	 thefirst  day  of	July,  1952, and  still	 in  its  employmentimmediately  before  the appointed day shall, in so  far  assuch  officer  or other employee is employed  in  connectionwith  the  undertaking	which has vested in  either  of	 theCorporations  by  virtue  of this Act, become  as  from	 theappointed date an officer or other employee, as the case maybe,  of the Corporation in which the undertaking has  vestedand  shall  hold his office or service therein by  the	sametenure, at the same remuneration and upon the same terms andconditions  and	 with the same rights and privileges  as  topension and gratuity and other matters as he would have heldthe  same under the existing air company if its	 undertakinghad  not vested in the Corporation and shall continue to  doso  unless  and until his employment in the  Corporation  isterminated  or until his remuneration, terms  or  conditionsare duly altered by the Corporation :Provided  nothing contained in this section shall  apply  toany officer or other employee who has, by notice in  writinggiven to the Corporation concerned prior to such date as maybe  fixed by the Central Government by notification  in	 theofficial gazette816intimated his intention of not becoming an officer or  otheremployee of the Corporation."After the Act was passed, notice was sent on June 17,  1953,to  each employee of all the air companies which were  beingtaken over by the proposed Corporation m and he was asked toinform	the officer on special duty by July 10, 1953, if  hedesired to give the notice contemplated by the proviso to s.20(1).	A form was sent in which the notice was to be  givenand it was ordered that it should reach the Chairman of	 theCorporation  by registered post by July 10.  The  appellantsadmittedly  did	 not  give this notice as  required  by	 theproviso to s. 20(1).In the meantime on June 8, 1953, a demand was made on behalfof  the appellants in which the Scindias were asked to	givean  assurance to them that in the event of  retrenchment  ofany  loaned  staff by the proposed  Corporation	 within	 thefirst five years without any fault, the said staff would  betaken back by the Scindias.  Certain other demands were alsomade.	The  Scindias replied to this letter on July  3	 andpointed	 out that they could not agree to give an  assuranceto  take back the loaned staff in case it was retrenched  bythe proposed Corporation within the next five years.  We arenot  concerned	with  the  other  demands  and	the  repliesthereto.   On July 8, a letter was written on behalf of	 theappellants  to	the Scindias in which it was said  that	 theappellants could not accept the contention contained in	 thecircular  of  May  6,  1953.   Though  the  appellants	werecarrying on this correspondence with the Scindias, they	 didnot  exercise the option which was given to them  under	 theproviso to s. 20(1) of the Act,. by July 10, 1953.  First ofAugust, 1953, was notified the appointed day under s. 16  ofthe Act and from that date the undertakings of the "existingair  companies" vested in the Corporation established  underthe  Act  (except  the	Air  India  International).   So  onAugust:1,  1953,  the ASI vested in the Corporation  and  s.20(1)  of  the Act came into force.  Hence as  none  of	 theappellants had exercised the option given to them under	 theproviso, they would also be governed by the said provision,817unless	the  contention. raised on their  behalf  that	theycould in no case be governed by s. 20(1), is accepted.The  tribunal  came  to the conclusion	that,  whatever	 theposition of the appellants as loaned staff from the Scindiasto  the	 ASI, as they were informed on May 6, 1953,  of	 theexact  position by the Scindias and they did not ask  for  areference  of an industrial dispute  immediately  thereafterwith the Scindias and as they"' did not exercise the  optiongiven  to  them by the proviso to s. 20(1) before  July	 10,1953,  they  would be governed by s. 20(1) of the  Act.	  Inconsequence,  they became the employees. of the	 Corporationas  from August 1, 1953 and would thus have no right  there-after  to  claim that they were still the employees  of	 theScindias and had a right to revert to them.  The consequenceof  all this was that they were held not to be	entitled  toany  of the benefits which they claimed in  the	 alternativeaccording  to the order of reference.  It is this  order  ofthe tribunal rejecting the reference which has been impugnedbefore us in the present appeal.The  main  contention of Mr. Chatterjee	 on  behalf  of	 theappellants is that they are not governed by s. 20 (1)  ofthe Act and in any case the contract of service between	 theappellants   and  the  Scindias	 was  not   assignable	 andtransferable  even by law and finally that even if s.  20(1)applied,   the	Scindias  were	bound  to  take	  back	 theappellants.We  are	 of opinion that there is no force in any  of  thesecontentions.   See.  20(1) lays down that every	 officer  oremployee  of the "existing air companies" employed  by	themprior  to  the first day of July, 1952, and still  in  theiremployment immediately before the appointed day shall becomeas  I from the appointed day an officer or employee, as	 thecase  may be, of the Corporation in which  the	undertakingsare  vested.   The object of this provision  was  to  ensurecontinuity of service to the employees of the "existing	 aircompanies"  which were being taken over by  the	 Corporationand  was thus for the benefit of the officers and  employeesconcerned.   It	 is further provided in s.  20(1)  that	 theterms  of  service etc... would be the same until  they	 areduly  altered by the Corporation.  One should  have  thoughtthat the employees of the air818companies  would welcome this provision as it  ensured	themcontinuity of service on the same terms till  they were dulyaltered.   Further there was no compulsion on the  employeesor the officers of the "existing air companies" to serve theCorporation  if	 they  did not want to do so.	The  provisolaid  down  that any officer or other employee who  did	 notwant to go into the service of the Corporation could get outof  service  by notice in writing given to  the	 Corporationbefore the date fixed, which was in this case July 10, 1953.Therefore,  even if the argument of Mr. Chatterjee that	 thecontract  of  service  between	the  appellants	 and   theiremployers  had been transferred or assigned by this  sectionand  that this could not be done,, be correct, it loses	 allits  force, for the proviso made it clear that any  one	 whodid not want to join the Corporation, was free not to do so,after giving notice upto a certain date.  Mr. Chatterjee  inthis  connection  relied on Nokes v.  Doncaster	 AmalgamatedCollieries Ltd. where it was observed at p. 1018-"It  is, of course, indisputable that (apart from  statutoryprovision to the contrary) the benefit of a contract enteredinto  by  A  to	 render personal  service  to  X  cannot  betransferred by X to Y without A's consent, which is the samething  as  saying  that, in order  to  produce	the  desiredresult,,  the old contract between A and X would have to  beterminated by notice or by mutual consent and a new contractof service entered into by agreement between A and Y."	Thisobservation  itself shows that a contract of service may  betransferred  by	 a statutory provision; but in	the  presentcase,  as  we  have already said, there	 was  no  compulsorytransfer  of the contract of service between  the  "existingair  companies",  and their officers and  employees  to	 theCorporation  for  each of them was given the option  not  tojoin the Corporation, if he gave notice to that effect.	 Theprovision  of s. 20(1) read with the proviso is a  perfectlyreasonable  provision  and,  as a matter  of  fact,  in	 theinterest  of  employees	 themselves.   But,  Mr.  Chatterjeeargues	that s. 20(1) will only apply to those who  were  inthe employ of the "existing air companies"; it would not(1) [1940] A.C. 1014,819apply  to those who might be working for the  "existing	 aircompanies"  on	being loaned from some	other  company.	  Inother  words, the argument is that the, appellants  were  inthe employ not of the ASI but of the Scinaias and  therefores.  20(1) would not apply to them and they would not  becomethe employees of the Corporation by virtue of that provisionwhen they failed to exercise the option given to them by theproviso.  According to him, only those employees of the	 ASIwho  were directly recruited by it, would be covered  by  s.20(1).We  are of opinion that this argument is fallacious.  It  istrue  that the appellants were not originally  recruited  bythe  ASI.   They  were recruited by the	 Scindias  and	weretransferred on loan to the ASI on various dates from 1946 to1951.	But for the purposes of s. 20(1) we have to see	 twothings:	 namely,  (i) whether the officer  or  employee	 wasemployed  by the existing air company on July 1,  1952,	 and(ii) whether he was still in its employment on the appointedday,  (namely, August 1,1953).	Now it is not disputed	thatthe  appellants were working in fact for the ASI on July  1,1952,  and were also working for it on August 1, 1953.	 Butit  is contended that though they were working for  the	 ASIthey were still not in its employment in law and were in theemployment of the Scindias because at one time they had beenloaned by the Scindias to the ASI.  Let us examine the exactposition  of  the appellants in order to  determine  whetherthey  were  in	the employ of the ASI or  not.	 It  is	 notdisputed  that they were working for the ASI and were  beingpaid  by  it; their hours of work as well  as  control	overtheir work was all by the ASI.	From this it would naturallyfollow that they were the employees of the ASI, even  thoughthey  might not have been directly recruited by it.   It  istrue  that  there  were certain special	 features  of  theiremployment  with the ASI.  These special features were	thatthey  were  on the same terms and conditions of	 service  aswere enjoyed by the employees of the Scindias in the  matterof  remuneration,  leave, bonus, etc.  It may also  be	thatthey could not be, dismissed by the ASI and the Scindias mayhave had to take action in case it was820desired to dismiss them.  Further it may be that they  couldbe  recalled by the Scindias and it may even be	  that	theymight have the option to go back to the Scindias.  But theseare  only three special terms of their employment  with	 theASI.   Subject to these	 special terms, they would  for	 allpurposes  be the employees of the ASI and thus would in	 lawbe in the employment of the ASI both on July 1, 1952 and  onAugust 1, 1953.	 The existence of these special terms in thecase of these appellants would not in law make them any	 theless  employees of the ASI, for whom they were	working	 andwho were paying them, who had power of control and directionover  them; who would grant them leave, fix their  hours  ofwork  and so on.  There can in our opinion be no doubt	thatsubject	 to these special terms the appellants were  in	 theemploy	of the ASI in law.  They would therefore be  in	 theemploy	of the ASI prior to July 1, 1952 and would still  bein   its   employ  immediately	before	 August	  1,   1953.Consequently,  they would clearly be governed by  s.  20(1).As  they  did not exercise the option given to them  by	 theproviso	 to  s.	 20(1), they became  the  employees  of	 theCorporation  from  August  1,  1953, by	 the  terms  of	 thestatute.The last point that has been urged is that even if s.  20(1)applies, the Scindias are bound to take back the appellants.Suffice it to say that there is no force in this  contentioneither.	  As soon as the appellants became by force  of	 lawthe  employees of the Corporation, as they did so become  onAugust 1, 1953, in the circumstances of this case, they	 hadno  further right against the Scindias and could not;  claimto be taken back in their employment on the ground that theywere still their employees, in spite of the operation of  s.20(1)  of  the	Act.   Nor  could  they	 claim	any  of	 thealternative benefits specified in the order of reference, asfrom  August 1, 1953, they are by operation of law only	 theemployees  of  the  Corporation	 and  can  have	 no   rightswhatsoever  against  the  Scindias.   We  are  therefore  ofopinion that the tribunal's decision is correct.  The appealfails  and is thereby dismissed.  There will be no order  asto costs.					 Appeal dismissed.821
