No. 31/1955.N.   A. Palkhivala and I..N. Shroff, for the Appellants.A. N. Kripal and D. Gupta, for the Respondent.1960.  November 22.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbySHAH,  J.-This is an appeal by seven appellants	 with  leavegranted by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay certifyingthat it involves a question of importance.The  appellants held 570 out of a total issue of 800  sharesof the Navjivan Mills Ltd., Kalol, a public limited company-hereinafter  referred  to as the Mills.	 Between  the  years1943-47,  the  Mills purchased 5,000 shares of the  Bank  ofIndia  Ltd.   At  an extraordinary general  meeting  of	 theshareholders  of  the Bank of India held on May 6,  1948,  aresolution  was passed increasing the share capital  of	 theBank  and  for	that  purpose offering	new  shares  to	 theexisting shareholders in the proportion of one new share forevery three shares held by the shareholders.  The face valueof  the	 new shares was to be Rs. 50, but  the	shares	wereissued at a premium of Rs. 50.	The shareholders had to	 payRs.  100  for each new share.  The Mills as  the  holder  of5,000 shares became entitled to receive 1,6662 shares of theBank of India at the rate of Rs. 100 per share.	 The Bank ofIndia  communicated its resolution by letter dated  May	 25,1948  and  enclosed  therewith	three  forms,  form  A	 foracceptance, form586B  for renunciation and 'form C which may  compendiously  becalled	a form for allotment to nominees.  On receiving	 thecircular  letter,  the	Directors of the  Mills	 passed	 thefollowing resolution:"Resolved  that	 the  company  having  a  holding  of  5,000ordinary  shares  in the capital of the Bank of	 India	Ltd.having	now received an intimation from the said  Bank	thatthis company is entitled to get 1,6662 more ordinary  shareson  payment of Rs. 50 as capital and Rs. 50 as	premium	 pereach share and it is considered proper to invest in the saidissue  of  the said Bank the funds of this  company  to	 theextent of 66 shares only and to distribute the right of thiscompany	 to  the remaining 1,600 shares of  the	 said  issueamongst	 the shareholders of this company in the  proportionof  the shares held by them in this company.  IT  IS  HEREBYRESOLVED  that the funds of this company may be invested  inthe  66 shares out of 1,666 shares offered by 'the  Bank  ofIndia  Ltd., and the right to the remaining 1,600 shares  ishereby	distributed among 800 shares of this company in	 theproportion  of	right  to two shares of	 the  Bank  per	 oneordinary share held in this company.The   Managing	Agents	may  take  steps  to  intimate	 theshareholders to exercise the right if they like to do so."Accordingly, the Mills exercised the right to take over only66  shares out of the shares offered and resolved  that	 theright  to the remaining 1,600 shares be distributed  amongstits  800 share holders.	 The seven appellants as holders  of570  shares of the Mills became entitled to 1,140 shares  ofthe  Bank of India.  The appellants agreed to the  allotmentof these shares and ultimately transferred them to a privatecompany--Jesinghbai Investment Co.' Ltd.The  assessment	 of  the  seven	 appellants  and  of   othershareholders of the Mills was reopened under s. 34(1)(a)  ofthe  Indian Income Tax Act by the Income Tax Officer on	 thefooting that, the release by the Mills of the shares of	 theBank  of India amounted to a distribution of "dividend"	 andthe   value  of	 the  right  released  in  favour   of	 theshareholders though taxable587under  s. 12 of the Act, had escaped tax.  The order of	 theIncome	Tax  Officer  reassessing the income  of  the  sevenappellants   was  confirmed  in	 appeal	 by  the   AppellateAssistant  Commissioner and by the Appellate  Tribunal.	  Atthe instance of the appellants, the i following question wassubmitted by the Tribunal to the High Court at Bombay  unders. 66(1) of the Income Tax Act:"Whether  on  the facts and circumstances of  the  case	 thedistribution  of  the right to apply for the shares  of	 theBank  of  India	 by Navjivan Mills Ltd.	 in  favour  of	 theassessees  amounted to a distribution of  "dividend"  withinthe meaning of s. 2(6A) of the Indian Income Tax Act."The High Court reframed the question as follows:"Whether  on  the facts and circumstances of the  case,	 thedistribution  of  the right to apply for the shares  of	 theBank  of  India	 by Navjivan Mills Ltd., in  favour  of	 theassessees  amounted  to a distribution of  "dividend"?"	 andanswered it in the affirmative.The High Court observed that the definition of "dividend" ins. 2(6A) was an inclusive and not an exhaustive	 definition,and  even if the distribution of the right to the shares  ofthe  Bank of India could not be regarded as dividend  withinthe extended meaning of that expression in s. 2(6A), it	 wasstill	dividend  within  the  ordinary	 meaning   of	thatexpression  and	 was taxable as income in the hands  of	 theappellants.Counsel for the appellants contended that the High Court wasnot  justified,	 having regard to the form of  the  questionwhich expressly related to the distribution of the right  tothe  Bank of India shares being dividend within the  meaningof  the	 definition in s. 2(6A) of the Income  Tax  Act,  inenlarging  the scope of the question and in answering it  inthe light of its ordinary meaning.  There is no substance inthis  contention.   "Dividend"	is defined in  s.  2(6A)  asinclusive  of various items and exclusive of certain  otherswhich it is not necessary to set out for the purpose of thisappeal.	 "Dividend" in its ordinary meaning is a588distributive  share  of the profits or income of  a  companygiven to its shareholders.  When the Legislature by s. 2(6A)sought	to define the expression "dividend" it added to	 thenormal meaning of the expression several other categories ofreceipts  which may not otherwise be included  therein.	  Bythe  definition	 in s. 2(6A), "dividend" means	dividend  asnormally understood and includes in its connotation  severalother receipts set out in the definition.  The Tribunal	 hadreferred the question whether the distribution of the  rightto   apply  for	 the  Bank  of	India  shares  amounted	  todistribution of dividend within the meaning of s. 2(6A)	 andin answering that question, the High Court had to take	intoaccount	 both  the normal and the extended meaning  of	thatexpression.   In the question framed by the Tribunal,  thereis  nothing to indicate that the High Court was called	uponto  advise  on	the question whether  the  receipts  by	 theappellants  amounted  to dividend only within  the  extendeddefinition of that expression in s. 2(6A).It  was	 also urged that in nominating its  shareholders  toexercise the option to purchase the new issue of the Bank ofIndia, the Mills did not distribute any dividend.  The Millswere,  it is true, not obliged to accept the offer  made  bythe  Bank of India, however advantageous it might have	beento  the Mills to accept the offer: it was open to the  Millsto renounce the offer.	The Mills had three options, (1)  toaccept	the shares, (2) to decline to accept the shares,  or(3)  to	 surrender  them in favour of its  nominee.   It  isundisputed that when the shares were offered by the Bank  ofIndia to its shareholders, the right to apply for the shareshad a market value of Rs. 100 per share.  The face value  ofthe  new share was Rs. 50 but the shareholders had to pay  apremium	 of Rs. 50, thus making a total payment of  Rs.	 100for acquiring the new share.  The new shares were quoted  inthe market at more than Rs. 200: and the difference  betweenthe amount payable for acquiring the shares under the  rightoffered by the Bank of India and the market quotation of theshares	was indisputably the value of the right.  The  Millscould not be compelled to obtain589this benefit if it did not desire to do so: it could  acceptthe shares or decline to accept those shares or exercise theoption of surrendering them in favour of its nominees.	Thislast option could be exercised by nominating the persons whowere to take over the shares and that is what the Mills did.The Mills requested the Bank of India to allot the shares toits nominees, and the request for allotment to its  nomineesamounted  to transfer of the right.  By its resolution,	 theMills  in truth transferred a right of the value of Rs.	 200for   each  share  held	 by  its  shareholders.	  This	 wasmanifestly not distribution of the capital of the Mills.  Itwas open to the Mills to sell the right to the shares of theBank of India in the market, and to distribute the  proceedsamong	the   shareholders.   Such  a	distribution   wouldundoubtedly have been distribution of dividend.	 If  insteadof selling the right in the market and then distributing theproceeds,  the	Mills directly transferred  the	 right,	 thebenefit in the hands of the shareholders was still dividend.Dividend  need	not  be	 distributed in	 money;	 it  may  bedistributed by delivery of property or right having monetaryvalue.	 The  resolution,  it is true, did  not	 purport  todistribute  the right amongst the shareholders as  dividend.It  did	 not  also  take  the  form  of	 a  resolution	 fordistribution  of dividend; it took the form of	distributionof  a right which had a monetary value.	 But by the form  ofthe  resolution	 sanctioning  the  distribution,  the	truecharacter  of the resolution could not be altered.   We	 aretherefore  of  the  view that the High Court  was  right  inholding that the distribution of the right to apply for	 andobtain two shares of the Bank of India (at half their marketvalue) for each share held by the shareholders of the  Millsamounted to distribution of dividend.The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.				     Appeal dismissed.75590
