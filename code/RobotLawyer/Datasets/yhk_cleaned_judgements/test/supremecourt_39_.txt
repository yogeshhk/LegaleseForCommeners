Later on,	theysold-some  of  those  shares  and suffered  a  loss  of	 Rs.1,78,438.   The Income-tax Officer in assessing the  taxableincome disallowed the loss and the Appellate905Assistant Commissioner on appeal confirmed that order.	 TheIncome-tax  Appellate Tribunal held that the shares did	 notbecome stock-in-trade of the appellants, but since the	lossincurred  was  incidental  to their  business  of  acquiringmanaging  agency,  it was allowable as a revenue  loss.	  Onreference,  the High Court held that the shares acquired  bythe appellants were a capital asset and the loss suffered bythe sale was of a capital nature.Held, that the High Court had taken the correct view of	 thematter and the appeal must fail.The question whether a transaction is or is not an adventureof the nature of trade has-to be decided in the light of theintention  of the assessee judged by the legal	requirementsassociated with the concept of trade or business.Since  the shares in question were purchased by	 the  appel-lants  with the intention of acquiring the  managing  agencyand not in the course of their business as dealers in shareswith  the intention of trading in those shares and what	 wasacquired  by such purchase was a capital asset in the  shapeof  a managing agency, it could not be said  merely  becausethe  managing agency could be utilised for earning  profits,that  those  shares  were  stock-in-trade  of  their   sharebusiness.G.Venkataswami Naidu and Co. v.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySHAH, J.-The High Court of Judicature at Bombay answered thefollowing two questions referred by the Income Tax AppellateTribunal,  Bench "B", Bombay, under s. 66(1) of	 the  IndianIncome-Tax Act, 1922:(1)  Whether the acquisition of the managing agency906of the Dawn Mills Co., Ltd., was in the nature of a  it	   n"business" carried on by the assessee company?(2)..If	 the  answer  to  the  first  question	is  in	 theaffirmative,  whether  the  loss suffered  by  the  assesseeof...company  of  Rs. 1,78,438 on purchase and sale  of	 400shares of the Dawn Mills Co., Ltd., being incidental to	 itsbusiness  of acquiring the managing agency, was a loss of  arevenue nature?,as follows:(1)..Acquisition  of the managing agency was an	 acquisitionof a capital asset;(2)..The loss in respect of the 400 shares was of a  capitalnature.Against	 the  order  of	 the  High  Court,  this  appeal  ispreferred with special-leave.The  appellants	 are a private	limited	 company  registeredunder the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and carry on  businessas  brokers,managing  agents  and  dealers  in	shares	 andsecurities.   One  of the objects for which  the  appellantswere  incorporated  was to acquire managing  agencies.	 Theappellants  also carried on business in shares of  differentcompanies,  and	 were assessed to income-tax as	 dealers  inshares and securities.M/s.  Sassoon J. David, & Co., Ltd. were the managing agentsof  the	 Dawn Mills Ltd.-a public limited  company-and	theyheld  2,507  out  of  a total issue  of	 3,200	shares.	  OnSeptember  28,	1946,  the appellants  purchased  from	M/s.Sassoon J. David & Co., Ltd. 1,507 shares of the Dawn  Millsat the rate of Rs. 2,321-8-0 per share and having obtained acontrolling  voting  right,  acquired  the  managing  agencyrights	of  the Mills.	The remaining, one  thousand  shareswere acquired from M/s.	 Sassoon J. David & Co., Ltd. by theDirectors  of the appellants at the rate of Rs.	 1,500.	  Atthe material time, the ruling market price of the shares  ofthe  Dawn  Mills  was Rs. 1,610.   In  December,  1946,	 theappellants sold 400 out of the shares purchased by them, andthereby suffered a loss of Rs. 1,78,438.  The loss  sufferedby the appellants in the year of account January 1, 1946, toDecember 31, 1946, by sale of shares including 400 shares ofthe907Dawn Mills was Rs. 1,92,834.  Crediting Rs. 1,05,907  earnedas profit in certain other share transactions, the net	losssuffered  in the share transactions in the year	 of  accountamounted to Rs. 86,927.	 The appellants valued their  sharesat  the end of the year of account, at cost or market  pricewhichever was lower.  By this method of valuation, the booksof  account of the appellants showed a loss of Rs.  7,97,792which  included a loss of Rs. 7,04,000 on the  valuation  ofthe  Dawn Mills shares held by the appellants at the end  ofthe year of account.In  the	 income-tax  assessment for the	 year  1947-48,	 theappellants  claimed Rs. 86,927 as loss on sales in trade  inshares	and Rs. 7, 97,792 as loss on valuation of  stock-in-trade.	 The Income Tax Officer, Companies'  Circle  III(1),Bombay,	 disallowed the loss suffered by the  appellants  inthe sale of the Dawn Mills shares, because in his view thoseshares	were purchased by way of capital-investment and	 theloss  suffered	by sale thereof could not be  allowed  as  atrading	 loss.	 He also held that the appellants  were	 notentitled to depart from the method adopted in earlier  yearsand  to	 value the closing stock of shares in  the  year  ofaccount	 at cost or market price whichever was lower and  toclaim  the  difference	between	 the  opening  and   closingvaluation  as  a  trading  loss.   The	Appellate  AssistantCommissioner  confirmed that order.  In appeal,	 the  IncomeTax Appellate Tribunal held that the managing agency of	 theDawn Mills was acquired by the appellants as a part of theirbusiness  activity and the shares of the Mills	having	beenpurchased in the regular course incidental to their businessof  acquiring the managing agency, the loss on the  sale  ofthose shares was allowable as a revenue loss; but the sharesof  the	 Dawn  Mills were not,	the  stock-in-trade  of	 theappellants' business and they were not entitled to treat thedifference between the purchase price and the value at closeof   the   year	 of  those  shares,  as	 a   trading   loss.Accordingly,  the Tribunal allowed Rs. 1,78,438 as  loss  onsale of 400 shares of the Dawn Mills., but did not allow Rs.7,04,000  as loss arising out of the valuation of  the	DawnMills shares at the908end  of	 the  year of account.	On the	application  of	 theCommissioner  of  Income Tax, the Tribunal referred  to	 theHigh Court the questions set out hereinbefore.	In the	HighCourt,	the  appellants	 took out a  notice  of	 motion	 fordirecting the Tribunal to refer certain questions which	 theappellants  claimed arose out of the order of  the  Tribunaland which the Tribunal did not refer.The High Court agreed with the opinion of the Tribunal	thatthe shares of the Dawn Mills were not the stock-in-trade  ofthe  appellants and that those shares were purchased by	 theappellants with the object of acquiring the managing agency.The  High Court, however , held that the shares acquired  bythe appellants formed a capital asset and the loss  sufferedby  sale of 400 out of those shares in the year	 of  accountbeing a capital loss, was not in the computation of income apermissible deduction.	The High Court dismissed the  noticeof motion taken out by the appellants.In  considering	 whether  a  transaction is  or	 is  not  anadventure  in  the  nature of trade,  the  problem  must  beapproached  in	the light of the intention of  the  assesseehaving	 regard	 to  the  "legal  requirements	 which	 areassociated  with  the concept of trade	or  business".	 Theinference  on  this question raised by the Tribunal  on	 thefacts  found  is  of  mixed law and  fact  and	is  open  tochallenge  before the High Court on a reference under s.  66of  the	 Income Tax Act G. Venkataswami Naidu & Co.  v.	 TheCommissioner of Income Tax (1).	 It was held in The OrientalInvestment  Co.,  Ltd. v. The Commissioner  of	Income	Tax,Bombay	(2),  that  the	 question  whether  the	 appellants'transactions amounted to dealing in shares and properties orto investment, is a mixed question of law and fact, and thatthe legal effect of the facts found by the Tribunal on whichthe assessee could be treated as a dealer or an investor, isa question of law.  The Tribunal held that the shares of theDawn Mills purchased by the appellants did not become  theirstock-in-trade.	 But they held that the transaction(1) [1959] SUPP.  S.C.R. 646.(2) [1958] S.C.R. 49.909having	been effected in the regular course of the  businessof  the	 appellants,  viz.,  the  acquisition  of   managingagencies,  the	loss resulting from the sale of	 shares	 wasincidental  to that business and was a revenue loss.  It  isnot easy to appreciate the process by which this  conclusionwas  reached.  The shares were purchased for the purpose  ofacquiring  the managing agency of the Dawn Mills; they	werenot  purchased in the course of the appellants' business  asdealers	  in  shares.	By  purchasing	the   shares   whichfacilitated  acquisition of the managing agency,  a  capitalasset  was acquired and merely because the  managing  agencycould be utilised for earning profit, the acquisition of theshares	which led to the acquisition of the managing  agencycould not, in the absence of an intention to trade in  thoseshares, be regarded as acquisition of stock-in-trade of	 theshare  business.  The appellants had  undoubtedly  purchasedthe  shares  of	 the  Dawn  Mills  with	 money	borrowed  atinterest, but that circumstance by itself does not  evidencean  intention to trade in the shares.  Nor is the fact	thatthe appellants are dealers in hares and their Memorandum  ofAssociation  authorises them to carry on business in  sharesof  any importance in the circumstances of this	 case.	 Theappellants by entering the shares of the Dawn Mills in theirstatement  of  shares  in which	 trading  transactions	werecarried	 on  could  not	 alter the  real  character  of	 theacquisition.   The  appellants were undoubtedly	 dealers  inshares; but the transaction in the Dawn Mills shares was  exfacie  not a business transaction.  The current market	rateat the date of purchase was Rs. 1,610 per share whereas	 theappellants acquired the shares at the rate of Rs.  2,321-8-0per  share.  Even assuming that the appellants acquired	 theentire block of 2,507 shares. from M/s.	 Sassoon J. David  &Co.,  Ltd.-the	shares	transferred  to	 the  names  of	 theDirectors  being  held	by them merely as  nominees  of	 theappellants-the price per share was considerably in excess ofthe  prevailing market rate.  The only reason  for  enteringinto  the transaction which could not otherwise be  regardedas a prudent business transaction, was the910acquisition  of the managing agency.  If the purpose of	 theacquisition  of	 a large block of shares at  a	price  whichexceeded  the current market price by a million	 rupees	 wasthe  acquisition of the managing agency,   the inference  isinevitable  that intention in purchasing shares was  not  toacquire	 them  as  part of the trade of	 the  appellants  inshares.	 The Tribunal found that the Dawn Mills' shares wereacquired by the appellants for obtaining the managing agencyof the Mills.  The agency was acquired by virtue of the vot-ing  power which the appellants obtained having purchased  avery  large block of shares, and for acquiring the  managingagency,	  the	appellants   did  not	pay   any   distinctconsideration.	The managing agency is manifestly the sourceof  profit of the appellants; but the shares  purchased	 andthe  managing agency acquired were both assets of a  capitalnature	and did not constitute stock-in-trade of  a  tradingventure.  If the shares were acquired for obtaining  controlover  the managing agency of the Dawn Mills, the  fact	thatthe  acquisition  of  the shares  was  integrated  with	 theacquisition  of	 the  managing agency  did  not	 affect	 thecharacter  of  the acquisition of  the	;hares.	  Subsequentdisposal  of some out of the shares by the appellants  couldalso  not  convert what was a capital  acquisition  into  anacquisition in the nature of trade.The  High  Court  was therefore right in  holding  that	 theacquisition  of the managing agency was an acquisition of  acapital	 asset	and  the loss incurred by sale	of  the	 400shares	was  of a capital nature.  The High Court  was	alsoright  in  dismissing  the notice of  motion  for  an  orderdirecting  the Tribunal to refer the questions suggested  bythe  appellants.  If the acquisition of the shares  was	 notacquisition of a stock-intrade, but of a capital asset,	 theappellants,  by valuing the shares at cost or  market  pricewhichever was lower, could not bring the difference  betweenthe purchase price and the valuation made by them into theirtrading account.The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs.911
