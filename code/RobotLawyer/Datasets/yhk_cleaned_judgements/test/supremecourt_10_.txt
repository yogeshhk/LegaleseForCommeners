They first entered	intocontracts  with two Mills agreeing to purchase gunnies at  acertain	 rate  for future delivery, and	 also  entered	intoagreement   with  third	 parties,  by  which  they   chargedsomething extra from those third parties and handed over thedelivery  order known as kutcha delivery order.	  The  Millshowever	 did  not accept the third  parties  as	 contractingparties,  but  only  as the agents  of	the  appellants	 anddelivered the goods against the kutcha delivery orders,	 andcollected  the	Sales Tax from the third parties.   The	 taxauthorities treated these transactions between the appellantand  the  third parties as fresh sales and  sought  to	levysales-tax  again,  which the appellants contended,  was	 notdemandable as there were no second sales; the delivery of  akutcha delivery order did not amount to a sale of goods, butwas  only  an assignment of a right to	obtain	delivery  ofgunnies which were not in existence and not appropriated  tothe  contract;	this  was only an assignment  of  a  forwardcontract.Held,  that the agreements between the parties	showed	thatthird  parties	were  not  recognised  by  the	sellers.   Adelivery  order	 being	a document of title  to	 goods,	 thepossession  of	such a document not only gave the  right  torecover	 the goods but also to transfer them to	 another  byendorsement   or   delivery.   There  being   two   separatetransactions of sale, one between the Mills and the originalpurchasers and the other between the original purchasers andthird parties, tax was payable at both the points.The  Sales Tax officer, Pilibhit v.

The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH,  J.-These	 are  two  appeals  on	certificatesgranted by the High Court of Andhra Pradesh against a commonjudgment in a sales tax revision filed by the appellants  inthe High Court.The facts are as follows: In the year 1952-53, for which theassessment  of	sales tax was in  question,  the  appellantsdealt  in  gunnies,  and purchased them from  two  Mills  inVishakapatnam  District and in respect of which they  issueddelivery orders to third parties, with whom they had enteredinto  separate transactions.  The procedure followed by	 theappellants was this: They first entered into contracts	withthe Mills agreeing to purchase gunnies at a certain rate forfuture	delivery.   Exhibit  A-1  is  a	 specimen  of	suchcontracts.  The appellants also entered into agreements withthe Mills, by which the Mills agreed to deliver the goods tothird  parties if requested by the appellants.	 The  Mills,however,  did  not accept the third parties  as	 contractingparties but only as agents of the appellants.  Exhibits	 A-2and A-2(a) are specimen agreements of this kind.  Before thedate  of  delivery, the appellants entered  into  agreementswith  third parties, by which they charged  something  extrafrom the third parties and handed over to them the  deliveryorders,	  which	 were  known  as  kutcha  delivery   orders.Exhibits A-3 and A-4 are specimens of the agreement and	 thedelivery orders respectively.  The Mills used to deliver thegoods  against	the  kutcha delivery orders  along  with  aninvoice and a bill, of which Exs.  A-6 and A-7 are specimensrespectively,  and  collected the sales tax from  the  thirdparties.    The	 tax  authorities,  however,   treated	 thetransaction  between the appellants and third parties  as  afresh sale, and sought to levy sales tax on it269again, which, the appellants, contended, was not demandable,as there was no second sale.The appellants failed in their contentions before the DeputyCommercial  Tax	 Officer, Guntur, and their appeals  to	 theDeputy	Commissioner  of Commercial Taxes,  Guntur  and	 theAndhra	 Sales	 Tax  Appellate	  Tribunal,   Guntur,	wereunsuccessful.	The appellants then went up in	revision  tothe High Court under the Madras General Sales Tax Act,	1939(as  amended  by Madras Act No. 6 of 1951), but	 were  againunsuccessful.	  The	High   Court,	 however,    grantedcertificates, on which these appeals have been filed.The contentions of the appellants are that the agreement andthe delivery of the kutcha delivery order did not amount  toa  sale of goods, but was only an assignment of a  right  toobtain delivery of the gunnies, which were not in  existenceat the time of the transaction with third parties, and	werenot  appropriated to the contract, or, in  the	alternative,that  this  was only an assignment of  a  forward  contract.They  seem to have relied in the High Court upon  the  deci-sions  of  this	 Court reported in The	Sales  Tax  Officer,Pilibhit  v.  Messrs.	Budh  Prakash  Jai  Prakash(1)	 andPoppatlal Shah v. The State of Madras (2) to show that thesetransactions  were not sales.  These cases were	 not  reliedupon  by  the appellants before us, presumably	because	 theHigh Court has adequately shown their inapplicability to thefacts here.The  learned Solicitor-General appearing for the  appellantsrested his case entirely upon the first contention,  namely,that  there  was  only an assignment of a  right  to  obtaindelivery  of the gunnies and not a sale.  He contended	thatthere was only one transaction of sale between the Mills andthe third parties, who, on the strength of the assignment ofthe right to take delivery, had received the goods from	 theMills.	in  our opinion, this does not	represent  the	truenature of the transactions, either in fact, or in law.To begin with, the Mills had made clear in their  agreementsthat  they  were  not  recognising  the	 third	parties	  ascontracting parties having privity with(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 243.(2) [1953] S.C.R. 677.270them,  and that delivery would be given against	 the  kutchadelivery  orders  to  the third parties	 as  agents  of	 theappellants.   The  Mills,  therefore,  recognised  only	 theappellants as contracting parties, and there was thus a saleto  the appellants from the Mills, on which ,;sales tax	 wascorrectly  demanded  and was paid.  In so far as  the  thirdparties	 were  concerned, they had purchased  the  goods  bypayment of an extra price, and the transaction must, in	 lawand  in	 fact,	be considered a fresh  transaction  of	salebetween	 the appellants and the third parties.	 A  deliveryorder  is a document of title to goods (vide s. 2(4) of	 theSale of Goods Act), and the possessor of such a document hasthe right not only to receive the goods but also to transferit to another by endorsement or delivery.  At the moment  ofdelivery  by the Mills to the third parties, there were,  ineffect, two deliveries, one by the Mills to the	 Appellants,represented,  in so far as the Mills were concerned, by	 theappellants' agents, the third parties, and the other, by theappellants   to	 the  third  parties  as  buyers  from	 theappellants.  These two deliveries might synchronise in pointof time, but were separate, in point of fact and in the	 eyeof law.	 If a dispute arose as to the goods delivered  underthe  kutcha delivery order to the third parties against	 theMills,	action could lie at the instance of the	 appellants.The  third parties could proceed on breach of contract	onlyagainst	 the appellants and not against the Mills.   In	 ouropinion, there being two separate transactions of sale,	 taxwas  payable  at  both the points,  as	has  been  correctlypointed out by the tax authorities and the High Court.The appellants relied upon a decision of the Andhra  PradeshHigh  Court  in The State of Andhra v.	Kolla  Sreeramamurty(3),  but there, the facts were different, and the  DivisionBench  itself  in dealing with the case,  distinguished	 thejudgment under appeal, observing that there was no scope forthe application of the principles laid down in the  judgmentunder  appeal, because in the cited case, "the	property  inthe goods did not pass from the mills to the assessee and(3)  Second  Appeals Nos. 194 & 195 of 1954 decided on	June27, 1957.271there  was no agreement of sale of goods to be	obtained  infuture between the assessee and the third party".In  the	 result, the appeals tail, and	are  dismissed	withcosts.	One hearing fee.					  Appeals dismissed.		       _________________
