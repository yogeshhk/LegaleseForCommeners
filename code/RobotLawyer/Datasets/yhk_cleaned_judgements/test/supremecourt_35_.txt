Under s.  42(1)  of	 the  IndianIncome-tax Act the respondent was deemed to be the  assesseeand  had to pay Rs. 3,78,49r as income-tax on behalf of	 thenon-resident  principal.   After allowing  for	the  amountslying  with  the  respondentfirm the  account  of  the	non-resident  principal showed a debit balance of RS.  3,20,162.The respondent treated this amount as a bad debt and claimedit  as	a deductible loss.  The Incometax  Officer  and	 theAppellate Assistant Commissioner disallowed the respondent'sclaim but the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal held it to be anallowable deduction being a bad debt incurred as a result ofthe  respondent's business activities with  the	 nonresidentprincipal.   The  High	Court  treating	 the  amount  as   adeductible business loss incurred by the respondent affirmedthe  decision of the Income-tax Tribunal.  On appeal by	 theCommissioner of Income-tax,Held, that the respondent was not entitled to the  reductionclaimed	 by it.	 The liability to pay imposed upon it  unders.  42(2) of the Income-tax Act did not arise directly	fromthe carrying on of the business nor was it incidental to thebusiness.   The loss was not a commercial loss	incurred  inthe  respondentfirm's own business but it arose out  of	 thebusiness  of another person and that was not  a	 permissiblededuction within s. io(1) or s. 10(2)(Xi) of the Act.Gresham Life Assurance Society v.

Gupta, for the appellant.A.V.  Viswanatha  Sastri  and  I.  N.  Shroff,	for   therespondent.1960.	December 6. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyKAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave brought by	 theCommissioner of Income-tax against the judgment and order ofthe High Court of Bombay answering the question in favour ofthe assessee.  The question referred by the Tribunal was:"Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances of the	casethe  amount of Rs. 3,20,162 is an allowable deduction  underSection 10(2)(xi) or 10(2)(xv) of the Income-tax Act?"which was amended by the High Court as follows:"Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances of the	casethe amount Rs. 3,20,162 is an allowable deduction"and  was   answered  in	 the  affirmative  and	against	 theappellant.The  facts  of	the  case  shortly  stated  are	 these:	 Therespondent  is	a registered firm carrying  on	business  ascommission  agents.  It was treated as the agent of  a	non-resident  principal  Haji Mohamed Syed Ali Barbari  of	PortSudan	(hereinafter   'referred  to  as   the	 nonresidentprincipal.   It	 was carrying on the business of  export  ofcloth and kariana (i.e., miscellaneous goods) to Aden, SaudiArabia and sudan.  It used to supply goods from India to thenonresident  principal, who on his part, was sending  cottonto  the	 respondent and other merchants for sale  in  India.For  the  years 1942-43, 1943-44, 1944-45 and  1945-46,	 therespondent firm was treated as the agent of the	 nonresidentprincipal under s. 43 of the Income-tax Act951(which will hereinafter be termed 'the Act') for the purposeof  income-tax and Excess Profits Tax.	The respondent	firmhad to pay in all Rs. 3,78,491 under s. 42(1) of the Act andafter  allowing for the amounts which were in its hands	 theaccount of the principal non-resident showed a debit balanceof  Rs. 3,20,162.  For the year of assessment, 1953-54,	 therespondent  firm  treated  this amount as  a  bad  debt	 andclaimed	 it  as	 a deductible loss to  be  set	off  againstprofits.  The Income-tax Officer treating this claim as	 oneunder s. 10(2)(xv) of the Act, disallowed it.  The AppellateAssistant Commissioner treated it as one under s. 10 (2)(xi)of  the	 Act and he also disallowed it.	 On  appeal  to	 theIncome-tax  Appellate Tribunal it was held to be a bad	debtand an allowable deduction as it was incurred as a result ofthe  business  activities  which  the  respondent  firm	 wascarrying on with the nonresident principal.  At the instanceof  the Commissioner of Income-tax, the case was  stated  tothe High Court and the High Court modified the question	 andanswered  the  same in the affirmative,	 i.e.,	against	 theappellant.   The High Court held that as the law imposed  anobligation  upon  the  respondent  firm	 to  discharge	 theliability  and-it  was	incidental to the  business  of	 therespondent the amount was a deductible loss; and even if  itwas not a debt, then also the amount could be claimed by theassessee as a business or trading loss, because in  arrivingat  the true profit of the respondent's business  that	losshad to be deducted.  The High Court thus applied s. 10(1) ofthe Act to the amount claimed by the respondent.The  allowability of the amount in dispute depends upon	 thenature	of the liability imposed upon the  respondent  firm.The  contention of the respondent's counsel was that it	 wascarrying  on foreign trade and had dealings with  a  foreignmerchant  and  in  the course of  the  business	 there	wereimports	 and  exports  and  therefore  the   interconnectionbetween the respondent firm and the non'-resident  principalwas  so intimate as to invite the application of  s.  42(1),i.e.,  the establishment of agency as 'contemplated in	thatsection.   The liability to pay arises under a. 42(2)  whichprovides952"Where a person not resident or not ordinarily	 resident inthe  taxable territories carries on business with  a  personresident  in the taxable territories, and it appears to	 theIncome-tax  Officer  that  owing  to  the  close  connectionbetween	 such  persons	the  course  of	      business is soarranged that the business done by the resident person	withthe person not resident or not ordinarily resident  producesto the resident either no profits or less than the  ordinaryprofits	 which might be expected to arise in that  business,the  profits  derived therefrom or which may  reasonably  bedeemed	to have been derived therefrom, shall be  chargeableto  income-tax in the name of the resident person who  shallbe  deemed  to	be, for all the purposes of  this  Act,	 theassessee in respect of such income-tax."Relying	 on this provision it was argued that the nature  ofthe respondent's business was foreign trade which was inter-connected  with the business of the non-resident  principal.Its  nature  was  such	as  to	attract	 the  imposition  ofliability  on the respondent firm under s. 42(2) of the	 Actand  therefore	the  loss so incurred must be  taken  to  beincidental  to	and  arising  out of  the  business  of	 therespondent."The thing to be taxed", said Lord Halsbury, L. C., "is	 theamount of profits and gains.  The word 'profits' I think  isto be understood in its natural and proper sense-in a  sensewhich no commercial man would. misunderstand": Gresham	LifeAssurance Society V. Styles (1).  Hence even if a  deductionis  not specifically enumerated in sub-section (2) of B.  10it  would still be a debatable item to reflect	the  taxableprofits.  The Privy Council in Commissioner of Income-tax v.Sir S. M. Chitnavis (1) held that the Act nowhere authorisesthe  deduction of bad debts of a business, such a  deductionis  necessarily	 allowable  because what  is  chargeable  toincome-tax  in	respect of a business are  the	profits	 andgains  of a year and in assessing the amount of profits	 andgains of that, year account must necessarily be taken of alllosses incurred, otherwise true profits and gains cannot  beascertained.  In order(1)(1892) 3 T.C. 185, 188 (H.L.).(2)(1932) L.R. 59 I.A. 290, 296.953that  a	 loss  may be deductible it must be a  loss  in	 thebusiness  of  the assessee and not payment relating  to	 thebusiness of somebody else which under the provisions of	 theAct  is	 deemed	 to  be and becomes  the  liability  of	 theassessee.   The	 loss  becomes	allowable  if  it   "springsdirectly  from	and is incidental" to the  business  of	 theassessee.   The	 decision  therefore  mainly  depends	uponwhether the loss claimed is a business loss of that  nature.In  our	 opinion  the amount which  became  payable  by	 therespondent  firm  cannot be called its	business  loss.	  Inorder  to be deductible the loss must be in the nature of  acommercial  loss  and, as has been said above,	must  springdirectly  out  of it and must really be	 incidental  to	 thebusiness itself.  It is not sufficient that it falls on	 thetrader	in some 'other capacity or is merely connected	withhis business.Counsel	 for the respondent relied upon a judgment  of	thisCourt  in  Badridas Daga v. The Commissioner  of  Income-tax(1).  In that case an agent of the assessee engaged for	 thepurpose	 of  carrying  on of  the  assessee's  business	 hadauthority  to  operate a bank account.	 Acting	 under	suchauthority  the agent withdrew from the bank monies  and	 putthem to his personal use.  The assessee was able to  recoverfrom the agent only a part of the amount misappropriated andthe balance was written off as irrecoverable debt and it washeld  that  it	was  not allowable  under  s.  10(2)(xi)  or10(2)(xv)  of  the  Act	 but it was  a	loss  deductible  incomputing  the profits under s. 10(1) of the Act as  a	lossincidental  to	the carrying on of  his	 business.   Counselrelied	on the following observation of	 Venkatarama  Ayyar,J., at p. 695:"The result is that when a claim is made for a deduction forwhich there is no specific provision in s. 10(2), whether itis admissible or not will depend on whether having regard toaccepted  commercial practice and trading principles it	 canbe said to arise out of the carrying on of the business	 andto be incidental to it.,,That passage has to be read in the circumstances of(1)[1959] S.C.R. 690.954that  case where the employment of agents was incidental  tothe carrying on of the business and it was observed that  itlogically followed that the losses which were incidental  tosuch  employment were also incidental to the carrying on  ofthe business.  At page 696, it was observed:-"At the same time it should be emphasised that the loss	 forwhich  a deduction could be made under s. 10(1) must be	 onethat  springs directly from the carrying on of the  businessand  is incidental to it and not any loss sustained  by	 theassessee, even if it has some connection with his business."Reference may also be made to an English decision in  Curtisv.  J.	& G. Oldfield Ltd. (1).	 In that case  the  managingdirector of a company of wine and spirit merchants embezzledmonies of the' company and that. was claimed as a loss as  abad debt and it was held that it was not a trading loss	 andwas therefore not an admissible deduction.  In that case thecontention of the Crown *as that the sum was not an ordinarytrading debt and therefore could not be a bad debt and	thatthe  loss was not connected with, and did not arise  out  ofthe trade.  Rowlatt, J., said at p. 330:"When the Rule speaks of a bad debt it means a debt which isa  debt	 that would have come into the	balance-sheet  as  atrading debt in the trade that is in question and that it isbad.   It does not really mean any bad debt which,  when  itwas  a	good  debt,  would not have come  in  to  swell	 theprofit."In  the	 present  case the liability was  imposed  upon	 therespondent  firm because it was treated as an  agent  withinthe  meaning of s. 42(1) of  the Act and the  liability	 wasimposed because of the deeming provision in sub-s. (2) of s.42 of the Act. can it be said, in the present case, that theliability  imposed upon the respondent firm was	 a  businessdebt arising out of the business of the respondent or to usethe  words of Venkatarama Ayyar, J., "springs directly	fromthe  carrying on of the business and is incidental to it  oris  a trading debt in the business of the respondent  firm."As we have said above, that condition has not(1)(1925) 9 T.C. 319.955been  fulfilled	 and  the  loss	 which	the  respondent	 hasincurred is not in its own business but the liability  arosebecause of the business of another person and that is not  apermissible deduction within s. 10(1) of the Act.  It is nota  loss which has to be deducted in respect of the  businessof  the	 respondent  from  the	profits	 and  gains  of	 therespondent's business.Counsel for the respondent also relied on Lord's Dairy	FarmLtd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay(1).	That 'was  acase of embezzlement by an employee and it was held that theloss directly arose from the necessity of employing cashiersand  therefore the loss by embezzlement was a  trading	lossbut in that very case it was held that before a claim  couldbe  made  for deduction of a debt as bad debt it must  be  adebt  in law.  That case is not applicable to the  facts  ofthe present case and is of little assistance in the decisionof the question before us.  Counsel for the respondent	nextrelied on Calcutta Co., Ltd. v. The Commissioner of  Income-tax  (2).   It	was held in that case  that  the  expression"profits  and gains" has to be understood in its  commercialsense and that there could be no computation of profits	 andgains  until  the expenditure necessary	 for  earning  thoseprofits and gains is deducted therefrom and that when  thereis  no	specific provision in s. 10(2) in  regard  to  claimmade,  its allowability will depend on	accepted  commercialpractice and trading principles and it will be allowed if itcan be said to arise out of the carrying on of the  businessand   is   incidental  to  it.	 As  a	 principle   it	  isunexceptionable	 but  it  does	not  carry  the	 matter	 anyfurther.It  was	 next  contended that the  matter  falls  within  s.10(2)(xi)  of the Act, i.e., it is in respect of  the  busi-ness.	This  contention has even less	substance  than	 theclaim  of deduction under s. 10(1).  Under cl. (xi)  also  adebt  is only allowable when it is a debt and arises out  ofand  as an incident to the trade.  Except  in  money-lendingtrade debts can only be so described(1) [1955] 27 I.T.R. 700.(2) [1959] 37 I.T.R.956if they	  are due from customers for goods supplied or loanstoconstituents	or  transactions of a  similar	kind.  Inevery  case the test is, was the debt due as an incident  tothe  business; if it is not of that character it will  be  acapital	 loss.	 Thus  a  loan	advanced  by  a	     firm ofSolicitors  to a company in the formation of which it  actedas   legal  adviser  is	 not  deductible  on  its   becomingirrecoverable  because that is not a part of the  professionof a Solicitor: C. I. R. v. Hagart & Burn Murdoch (1).In our opinion the High Court 'was in error in answering thequestion  in favour of the respondent.	We  therefore  allowthis  appeal, set aside the judgment and order of  the	HighCourt  and answer the question against the respondent.	 Theappellant will have his costs in this Court and in the	HighCourt.					 Appeal allowed.
