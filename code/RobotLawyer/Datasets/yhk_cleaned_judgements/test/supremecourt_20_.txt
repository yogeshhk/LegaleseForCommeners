Payment	 wasmade  on piece rates according to the amount of	 work  done,and  the bidis which did not come upto the  proper  standardcould be rejected.The respondent workmen applied for leave for 15 days and didnot go to work, for which period the appellants did not	 paytheir wages; in consequence the concerned workmen applied tothe Payment of Wages Authority for payment of wages to them.The appellant's contention that the respondent workmen	werenot his workmen within the meaning of the Factories Act, wasrejected  and  the claim for payment of wages  was  allowed.The  question  therefore  was whether  the  appellants	wereworkmen within the meaning of the Factories Act.Held,  that  the  nature  of extent  of	 control  varies  indifferent  industries  and  cannot by  its  very  nature  beprecisely  defined.   When  the operation was  of  a  simplenature	and  could not be supervised all the  time  and	 thecontrol was at the end of day by the method of rejecting thework done which did not come up to proper standard, then, itwas the right to supervise and not so much the mode in whichit was exercised which would determine whether a person	 wasa workman or an independent contractor.The  mere fact that a worker was a piece-rate  worker  wouldnot  necessarily  take him out of the category of  a  workerwithin the meaning of S. 2(1) Of the Factories Act.  In	 theinstant case the respondent workmen could not be said to  beindependent contractors and were workmen within the  meaningof s. 2(1) of the Factories Act.Held,  further, that the leave provided for under S.  79  ofthe  Factories Act arose as a matter of right when a  workerhad put21162in  a minimum number of working days and he was entitled  toit.  The fact that the workman remained absent for a  longerperiod had no bearing on his right to leave.State  v.

Dhebar,	 for  theIntervener (State of Bombay).1960.	December 9. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyWANCHOO,  J.-This  is  an  appeal by  special  leave  in  anindustrial  matter.  The appellant is the manager of a	birifactory	 in Nagpur.  Respondents 2 to 4 are working in	thatfactory.   They	 applied  for leave for	 fifteen  days	fromDecember  18,  1955, to January 1, 1956, and did not  go  towork  during that period.  The appellant did not  pay  theirwages for these days and in consequence they applied to	 thePayment	  of   Wages  Authority	 (hereinafter	called	 theAuthority)  for	 payment  to them of wages  which  had	beenwithheld.   Their  claim  was that  they  were	entitled  tofifteen	 days' leave in the year under ss. 79 and 80 of	 theFactories  Act, 1948.  The Authority allowed the  claim	 andgranted them a sum of Rs. 90/16/- in all as wages which	 hadbeen  withheld	for  the period of  leave.   Thereupon,	 theappellant  filed  an  application  under  Art.	226  of	 theConstitution  before  the High Court at	 Nagpur.   His	maincontention  was	 that respondents 2 to 4  were	not  workerswithin	the  meaning  of the Factories	Act  and  could	 nottherefore claim the benefit163of  a. 79 thereof The respondents contended that  they	wereworkers	 within	 the meaning of the Factories Act  and	wereentitled  to the sum awarded to them by the Authority.	 TheHigh  Court on a consideration of the circumstances came  tothe conclusion that respondents Fir2 to 4 were workers unders. 2(1) of the Factories Act and therefore the order of	 theAuthority  was	correct	 and dismissed	the  petition.	 Theappellant  then applied for a certificate to appeal to	thisCourt  which  was refused.  He then obtained  special  leavefrom  this  Court  and that is how the matter  has  come  upbefore US.Sec.  2(1)  defines  a worker to  mean	a  person  employed,directly or through any agency, whether for wages or not, inany  manufacturing process, or in cleaning any part  of	 themachinery or premises used for a manufacturing process or inany other kind of work incidental to, or connected with, themanufacturing  process, or the subject of the  manufacturingprocess.   The	main  contention of the	 appellant  is	thatrespondents  2 to 4 are not employed in the  factory  withinthe  meaning  of  that word in s. 2(1).	  Reliance  in	thisconnection is placed on two decisions of this Court, namely,Dharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. v. State of Saurashtra (1)and Shri Chintaman Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (2).In  Dharangadhara Chemical Works (1), this Court  held	withreference to s. 2 (s) of the Industrial Disputes Act,  whichdefined	 "workman"  that the word  "employed"  used  thereinimplied a relationship of master and servant or employer andemployee  and  it was not enough that a	 person	 was  merelyworking	 in  the premises belonging to	another	 person.   AdistinCtion  was  also	drawn  between	a  workman  and	  anindependent  contractor.  The prima facie test	whether	 therelationship of master and servant or employer and  employeeexisted	 was laid down as the existence of the right in	 theemployer  not merely to direct what work was to be done	 butalso  to control the manner in which it was to be done,	 thenature	or  extent  of such  control  varying  in  differentindustries and being(1) [1957] S.C.R. 152.(2) [1958] S.C.R. 1340.164by  its	 nature incapable of being precisely  defined.	 Thecorrect	 approach therefore to the question was held  to  bewhether	 having regard to the nature of the work, there	 wasdue control and supervision of the employer. The matter came up again for consideration in	   ChintamanRao's  case  (1)  which	 also happened	to  relate  to	biriworkers,  and  s.  2(1)	 of the	 Factories  Act	 had  to  beconsidered  in it.  It was held that the test laid  down  inDharangadhara Chemical Works (2) with respect to s. 2(s)  ofthe  Industrial Disputes Act would also apply to s. 2(1)  ofthe  Factories	Act.  Finally, it was pointed out  that	 thequestion  whether a particular person working in  a  factorywas an independent contractor or a worker would depend	uponthe  terms of the contract entered into between him and	 theemployer  and  no general proposition could  be	 laid  down,which would apply to all cases.	 Thus in order to arrive  atthe  conclusion whether a person working in a factory  (likerespondents  2	to  4  in  this	 case)	is  an	 independentcontractor  or	a worker the matter would  depend  upon	 thefacts of each case.Let us then turn-to the facts which have been found in	thiscase.	It has been found that the respondents work  at	 thefactory	 and  are  not at liberty to work  at  their  homes.Further they work within certain hours which are the factoryhours, though it appears that they are not bound to work forthe entire period and can go away whenever they like;  theirattendance is noted in the factory; and they can come and goaway  at any time they like, but if any worker	comes  aftermidday	he  is	not supplied with tobacco and  is  thus	 notallowed to work, even though the factory closes at 7 p.m. inaccordance with the provisions of the Factories Act and whenit  is said that they can return at any time, it is  subjectto  the condition that they cannot remain later than 7	p.m.There  are standing orders in the factory and  according  tothose standing orders a worker who remains absent for  eightdays (presumably without leave) can be removed.	 The paymentis made on piece-rates according to the amount of work	donebut the management has the(1) [1958] S.C.R. 1340.(2) [1957] S.C.R. 152.165right  to reject such biris as do not come up to the  properstandard.   It is on these facts that we have to decide	 thequestion  whether  respondents 2 to 4 were employed  by	 theappellant.It  will be immediately noticed that the facts in this	caseare substantially different from the facts in Shri ChintamanRao's  case  (1).   In that case the  factory  entered	intocontracts   with   independent	contractors,   namely,	 theSattedars,  for	 the supply of biris.	The  Sattedars	weresupplied  tobacco  by the factories and in some	 cases	birileaves	also.  The Sattedars were not bound to work  in	 thefactory nor were they bound to prepare the biris  themselvesbut  could get them prepared by others.	 The Sattedars	alsoemployed  some coolies to work for them and payment  to	 thecoolies	 was made by the Sattedars and not by  the  factory.The Sattedars in their turn collected the biris prepared  bythe  coolies  and took them to the factory where  they	weresorted and checked by the workers of the factory and such ofthem as were rejected were taken back by the Sattedars to beremade.	 The payment by the factory was to the Sattedars andnot to the coolies.  In these circumstances it was held thatthe  Sattedars were independent contractors and the  coolieswho worked for them were not the workers of the factory.The  facts  of	the present case,  however,  are  different.Respondents  2 to 4 have to work at the factory and that  initself	implies	 a  certain amount  of	supervision  by	 themanagement.   Their attendance is noted and they cannot	 getthe  Work  done by others but must do it  themselves.	Eventhough	they  are not bound to work for	 the  entire  periodduring	which the factory is open it is not in dispute	thatif they come after midday, they are not given any work	andthus  lose wages for that day, the payment being  at  piece-rates.	Further though they can stay away without asking forleave,	the management has the right to remove them if	theyso stay away for a continuous period of eight days.  Lastly,there  is  some	 amount	 of  supervision  inasmuch  as	 themanagement has the right of rejection of the biris  preparedif they do not come up to the proper standard.(1)  (1958) S.C.R. 1340.166The  question  therefore  that arises is  whether  in  thesecircumstances  it can be said whether the  appellant  merelydirects	 what  work  is to be done but	cannot	control	 themanner in which it has to be done; of course, the nature  orextent of control varies in different industries and  cannotby its very nature be precisely defined.  Taking the  natureof  the work in the present case it can hardly be said	thatthere must be supervision all the time when biris are  beingprepared  and unless there is such supervision there can  beno direction as to the manner of work.	In the present	casethe operation being a simple one, the control of the  mannerin  which  the work is done is exercised at the end  of	 theday, when biris are ready, by the method of rejecting  thosewhich do not come up to the proper standard.  In such a caseit  is	the right to supervise and not so much the  mode  inwhich  it  is  exercised  which	 is  important.	  In   thesecircumstances, we are of opinion that respondents 2 to 4 whowork  in this factory cannot be said to be independent	con-tractors.  The limited freedom which respondents 2 to 4 haveof coming and going away whenever they like or of  absentingthemselves  (presumably	 without leave) is due to  the	factthat  they are piece-rate workers; but the mere fact that  aworker is a piece-rate worker would not necessarily take himout  of	 the category of a worker within the meaning  of  s.2(1)   of  the	Factories  Act.	  Considering	the   entirecircumstances and particularly the facts that if the  workerdoes  not  reach the factory before midday he  is  given  nowork,  he  is to work at the factory and cannot	 work  else-where,	he  can be removed if lie is absent for	 eight	dayscontinuously  and finally his attendance is noted and  birisprepared by him are liable to rejection if they do not	comeup to the standard, there can be no doubt that respondents 2to  4  are  workers within the meaning of  s.  2(1)  of	 theFactories  Act.	 This is also the view taken by	 the  BombayHigh  Court in State v. Shankar Balaji Waje (1)	 in  similarcircumstances and that we think is the right view.Then it was urged that even if the respondents are(1)  A.I.R. 1960 Bom. 296.167workers	 under s. 2(1), s. 79 should not be applied to	themas  they can absent themselves whenever they like.  In	thisvery  case it is said that the respondents  remained  absentfor  a	longer	period than that provided  in  the  Act	 andtherefore they do not need any leave.  This argument has  inour opinion no force.  The leave provided under s. 79 arisesas  a  matter of right when a worker has put  in  a  minimumnumber	of working days and he is entitled to it.  The	factthat  the  respondents remained absent for a  longer  periodthan that provided in s, 79 has no bearing on their right toleave,	for if they so remained absent for such period	theylost  the  wages  for  that period  which  they	 would	haveotherwise  earned.   That however does not  mean  that	theyshould	also lose the leave earned by them under s. 79.	  Inthe  circumstances  they were entitled under s.	 79  of	 theFactories  Act to proportionate leave during the  subsequentcalendar  year	if  they  had  worked  during  the  previouscalendar year for 240 days or more in the factory.  There isnothing on the record to show that this was not so.  In	 thecircumstances the appeal fails and is hereby dismissed	withcosts.	One set of hearing costs.Appeal dismissed.
