PETITIONER:THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH	Vs.RESPONDENT:THE GWALIOR SUGAR CO., LTD., AND OTHERS(AND CONNECTED APPEALDATE OF JUDGMENT:30/11/1960BENCH:ACT:Cess-Levy  on sugar cane ordered by erstwhile  Ruler-Consti-tutional validity-Constitution of India, Arts. 14, 265, 373.HEADNOTE:In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing,	 forwhich  it was necessary to develop the cane area, the  Rulerof  the erstwhile Gwalior State by an order dated  27-7-1946sanctioned  the	 levy of cess of one anna per maund  on	 allsugar  cane purchased by the respondent company.   When	 theGovernment  of Madhya Bharat, which was the successor  stateof  the former Gwalior State, made a demand for	 payment  ofthe  cess, the respondent filed a petition before  the	HighCourt of Madhya Bharat challenging the legality of the	levyon  the grounds (1) that the order dated 27-7-1946 was	onlyan  executive  order  and not a law under Art.	265  of	 theConstitution  of  India and that, therefore,  there  was  noauthority  for the imposition of the cess after January	 26,1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and  violatedArt. 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable  topay  the  cess the other sugar factories in the	 State	wereexempt.	  It was found that at the time when cess was  firstlevied	there  was  no sugar factory  in  existence  in	 theGwalior State other than that of the respondent.Held, that (i) the Ruler of an Indian State was an  absolutemonarch	 in which there was no constitutional limitation  toact   in  any  manner  be  liked,  he  being   the   supremelegislature,  the supreme judiciary and the supreme head  ofthe  executive.,  Consequently, the  order  dated  27-7-1946issued	by  the	 Ruler of Gwalior State amounted  to  a	 lawenacted by him and became an existing law under Art. 372  ofthe  Constitution of India.  The levy of cess was  thereforeby authority of law within the meaning of Art. 265;Madhaorao  Phalke  v. The State of Madhya Bharat,  [1961]  1S.C.R. 957, followed.(2)  the levy of cess did not contravene Art. 14 because (a)the object was cane development in the particular area and ageographical  classification based upon	 historical  factorswas  a	permissible mode of classification, and	 (b)  a	 taxcould  not  be struck down as discriminatory unless  it	 wasfound  that  it was imposed with a deliberate  intention  ofdifferentiating between620an  individual	and  individual; and  particularly,  in	 theinstant case, where when cess was first sought to be levied,there was no other sugar factory existing in the State.JUDGMENT:CIVIL  APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 98 and  99of 1957.Appeals	 from the judgment and order dated August 31,  1954,of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Civil Misc.	 Case No.  9of 1953.R.   Ganapathi Iyer and D. Gupta, for the appellant in C. A.No. 98 of 1957 and respondents in C. A. No. 99 of 1957.S.   K. Kapur and Naunit Lal, for the respondents in C.	  A.No. 98 of 1957 and appellant in C. k. No. 99 of 1957.1960.  November 30.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredby.MUDHOLKAR, J.-These are cross appeals from two judgments  ofthe  erstwhile	High Court of Madhya Bharat.  Both  of	themarise out of a writ petition presented by the Gwalior  SugarCompany	 Ltd., who are respondents in C. A. 98 of  1957,  inwhich they challenged the validity of the levy of a cess  onsugarcane  purchased  by the respondents.   The	 grounds  onwhich  the validity of the cess is challenged are two.	 Thefirst ground is that it was not levied under any law and thesecond	ground	is  that it is	discriminatory	against	 therespondents.In order to appreciate these contentions it is necessary  toset out certain facts.	In the year 1940 in pursuance of  anagreement  entered  into between the Government	 of  GwaliorState  and  Sir Homi Mehta and others a	 sugar	factory	 wasestablished  at	 Dabra.	  The name of that  factory  is	 TheGwalior	 Sugar	Co., Ltd.  On June 20,	1946,  the  MaharajaScindia, the ruler of Gwalior State constituted a  Committeeto consider the desirability of imposing a "cane cess on thelines  of the United Provinces or Bihar and to	recommend  aprocedure  for fixation of sugar prices within the terms  ofthe  agreement	subsisting between the	Government  and	 thefactory".  The Report of the			    621Committee  was submitted to the Maharaja by the Chairman  onJuly 23, 1946.	In their report the Committee observed	thatin order to put the industry on a sure and stable footing itwas absolutely necessary to develop the cane area and  yieldin  the	 shortest  possible  time.   For  this	purpose	 theCommittee  recommended that it was essential to levy a	canecess  of one anna per maund on all sugar cane  purchased  bythe  respondent	 factory.  At the foot of  this	 report	 theMaharaja   made	  the	following   endorsement	   "Guzarishsanctioned,  J. M. Scindia, 27-7-46".  It may  be  mentionedthat  the Committee also recommended the establishment of  aCane  Development  Board.   This  recommendation  was	alsoaccepted  by  the Ruler.  On August 26, 1946,  the  EconomicAdviser	 to the Government of Gwalior wrote a letter to	 theManager	 of  the respondent factory.  It will be  useful  toreproduce  the	text  of that letter as it  will  have	somerelevance  on  the  second  ground  on	which  the  cess  ischallenged.  The letter runs thus:"Dear air,With a view to expand cane area and cane yield in the  Harsicommanded  area so that the Gwalior Sugar Co., Ltd., be	 puton  a  sound and stable basis, the Gwalior  Government	havedecided	 to impose a cane cess of one anna per maund on	 allsugarcane purchased by your factory.  The operation of	thiscess will start from the coming sugarcane crushing season.The  proceeds  of  the cess have  been	earmarked  for	canedevelopment work in the Harsi region that will be undertakenby a Cane Development Board constituted for the purpose.The Cane Development Board expects your co-operation in thisdevelopment work, which is proposed to be undertaken as soonas possible.		      Yours sincerely,			 Secretary,		    Cane Development Board." The respondent factory protested against this levy.   Afterthe formation of the State of Madhya Bharat,79622the  respondent made a representation to the  Government  ofMadhya	 Bharat	 against  the  levy  of	 the   cess.	Thatrepresentation was, however, rejected.	They, then, paid thecess for the years 1946 to 1948 amounting to Rs. 1,17,712-8-2.   The Government of Madhya Bharat made a demand from	 therespondents  for  a sum of Rs. 2,79,632-14-9 for  the  years1949  to 1951.	The respondents challenged the	demand	uponthe  two  grounds  set out above and  presented	 a  petitionbefore	the  High Court of Madhya Bharat  for  quashing	 thedemand.	 The petition was opposed on behalf of the State  ofMadhya	Bharat which was the successor State of	 the  formerGwalior	  State.   The	High  Court  granted  the   petitionpartially by holding that the State of Madhya Bharat was notentitled to recover the cess due from the respondents  afterJanuary 26, 1950.  It may be mentioned that it was  concededon  behalf of the respondent company before the	 High  Courtthat  the  State was entitled to recover the cess  prior  toJanuary 26, 1950.  Later, however, the respondents preferreda  review  petition to the High Court in which	they  soughtrelief	even in respect of the cess for the period prior  toJanuary 26, 1950.  The review petition was dismissed by	 theHigh  Court upon the ground that no such petition lay.	 Therespondents are challenging the view of the High Court in C.A.  No.	 99  of 1957.  After the coming into  force  of	 theStates Reorganization Act, 1956, the State of Madhya Pradeshhas been substituted for the State of Madhya Bharat and theyare shown as appellants and respondents respectively in	 thetwo appeals.The High Court struck down the cess upon the ground that theorder dated July 27, 1946, of the Gwalior Durbar was only anexecutive  order  and  not  a law  under  Art.	265  of	 theConstitution and that, therefore, there was no authority forthe  imposition	 of the cess after January 26,	1950.	Thispoint is covered by the decision of this Court in  MadhaoraoPhalke v. The State of Madhya Bharat and Another (1) decidedon  October 3, 1960.  In the course of the judgment of	thisCourt delivered by Gajendragadkar, J., he pointed out:(1)  [1961] 1 S.C.R. 957.			    623	      "It would thus be seen that though Sir  Madhya	      Rao  was gradually taking steps  to  associate	      the  public with the government of  the  State	      and  with	 that  object  he  was	establishing	      institutions  consistent with  the  democratic	      form of rule, he had maintained all his powers	      as  a  sovereign	with  himself  and  had	 not	      delegated	 any of his powers in favour of	 any	      of  the said bodies.  In other words,  despite	      the  creation  of these  bodies  the  Maharaja	      continued	 to be an absolute monarch  in	whom			    were   vested   the	 supreme   power   of	the	      legislature, the executive and the judiciary.	      "In  dealing with the question as	 to  whether	      the orders issued by such an absolute  monarch	      amount to a law or regulation having the force	      of  law,	or whether  they  constitute  merely	      administrative orders, it is important to bear	      in mind that the distinction between executive	      orders  and legislative commands is likely  to	      be  merely  academic where the  Ruler  is	 the	      source   of   all	  power.    There   was	  no	      constitutional  limitation upon the  authority	      of the Ruler to act in any capacity he  liked;	      he  would	 be  the  supreme  legislature,	 the	      supreme judiciary and the supreme head of	 the	      executive,   and	all  his  orders,   how-ever	      issued, would have the force of law and  would	      govern  and regulate the affairs of the  State	      including the rights of the citizens.	      "It  is also clear that an order issued by  an	      absolute monarch in an Indian State which	      had  the	force  of law  would  amount  to  an	      existing	 law   under   Art.   372   of	 the	      Constitution."From  these  observations it would be quite clear  that	 theendorsement  of	 the  Maharaja on the  Guzarish	 whereby  heaccepted the recommendation of the Committee about  imposinga cess on the sugarcane crushed by the factory amounted to alaw,  however  informal that endorsement may appear  to	 be.Since  it was a law enacted by the Maharaja then,  with	 thecoming into force of the Constitution, it became an existinglaw under Art. 372 and thus it satisfies the requirements ofArt. 265 of the Constitution.624Disagreeing  with the High Court we therefore hold that	 thecess was imposed by authority of law.  What	remains	 to  be	 considered  is	 whether  this	cessviolates the guarantee of equal protection contained in Art.14 of the Constitution.	 What was urged Ltd. before the HighCourt and what was also urged before us was that this is theonly  sugar factory in the present State of  Madhya  Pradeshwhich  is  liable  to  pay  the	 cess  whereas	other  sugarfactories are exempt therefrom.	 The result of this is	thatthose other sugar factories do not have to pay this cess andare  thus better placed in the matter of carrying  on  theirbusiness  of manufacturing and marketing of sugar  than	 therespondents  and  so  there is	discrimination	against	 therespondents in that respect.  It seems to us, however,	thatthis cannot be regarded as discrimination at all, even afterthe formation of the State of Madhya Pradesh.  The reason isthat the difference arises out of the historical  backgroundto  the imposition of this cess.  It has recently been	heldby  this  Court	 in  M. K. Prithi  Rajji  v.  The  State  ofRajasthan  &  Ors  (1) decided on  November  2,	 1960,	thatgeographical  classification based upon	 certain  historicalfactors	 is  a permissible mode of classification.   In	 ouropinion,  the principle underlying that decision would	alsoapply  to  the present case.  In view of the  decision,	 Mr.Kapur the learned counsel for the respondents sought to resthis argument on a somewhat different ground.  That ground isthat  under  the  order of June	 27,  1946,  the  respondentfactory	 alone	was  made liable to pay	 cess  and  that  nosimilar	 liability  was imposed upon any  other	 factory  inGwalior.   It  would, however, appear that at that  time  noother  sugar factory was at all in existence in the  GwaliorState.	  The  respondent  factory  was	 the  first  to	  beestablished and for all we know is even today the only sugarfactory in the area which formerly constituted the State  ofGwalior.   We have already quoted the letter written by	 theEconomic Adviser to the Gwalior Government addressed to	 theManagement of the Gwalior Sugar Co., Ltd.  From that  letterit would(1)  C.A. NO. 327 of 1956.625appear that the cess was imposed for a definite purpose	 andthat  was  to expand the cane area in  the  Harsi  commandedregion	so  that the Gwalior Sugar Co., Ltd., that  is,	 therespondent factory would be put on a sound and stable basis.It  will, therefore, be clear that far	from  discriminatingagainst the factory, the whole object of the cess was to  dosomething for the benefit of the factory and for the benefitof the sugar industry in the State which was at that date inits  infancy.	Apart from the fact that in  the  matter  oftaxation the legislature enjoys a wide discretion, it shouldbe  borne  in  mind  that a tax cannot	be  struck  down  asdiscriminatory	unless	the  Court finds that  it  has	beenimposed	 with  a  deliberate  intention	 of  differentiatingbetween	 an individual and an individual or upon grounds  ofrace,  religion, creed, language or the like.  There was  noquestion  of doing anything like this in the year 1946	whenno other sugar factory existed in the State of Gwalior.	 Thecess  was thus good in law when enacted and it has not	beenrendered  void	under Art. 13 by reason of the	coming	intoforce  of  the Constitution on the ground that	it  violatesArt.  14.   In our opinion, therefore, both the	 grounds  onwhich  the  validity  of  the cess  is	challenged  are	 illconceived and the cess is a perfectly valid one.  It  would,therefore,  be competent to the State of Madhya	 Pradesh  torealise	 that  cess from the respondent factory.   Upon	 theview  we  have taken in the matter in C. A. No. 98  of	1957nothing	 remains to be considered in C. A. No. 99  of  1957.Accordingly  we	 allow the appeal by the State	and  dismissthat of the respondents.The costs of the appeal will be borne by the respondents  inC.  A.	No.  98 of 1957.  As both the  appeals	were  arguedtogether, there will be only one set of hearing fees.Appeal No. 98 allowed.Appeal No. 99 dismissed.626
