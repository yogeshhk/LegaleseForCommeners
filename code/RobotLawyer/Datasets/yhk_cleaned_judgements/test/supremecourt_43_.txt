PETITIONER:THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-TAX, BOMBAY	Vs.RESPONDENT:M/S.  DWARKADAS KHETAN & CO.DATE OF JUDGMENT:01/12/1960BENCH:HIDAYATULLAH, M.BENCH:HIDAYATULLAH, M.KAPUR, J.L.SHAH, J.C.CITATION: 1961 AIR  680		  1961 SCR  (2) 821 CITATOR INFO : E	    1966 SC  15	 (8) MV	    1966 SC1490	 (23)ACT:Income	Tax--Partnership  firm including minor,	 if  can  beregistered--Indian  Income-tax	Act, 1922 (11 of  1922),  S.26A--Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (IX of 1932), s. 30.HEADNOTE:One  of	 the persons who entered into a	 partnership  was  aminor and in the instrument of partnership he was  describedas a full partner with equal rights and obligations with theother  adult  partners.	 The deed of partnership  which	 wassigned	by the minor was produced before th e  Registrar  ofFirms f or registration and he granted a certificate showingthe  minor as a full partner and not as one entitled  merelyto the benefits of the partnership.  The Income-tax Officer,however,  refused to register the firm under S. 26A  of	 theIndian	Income-tax  Act and his decision was upheld  by	 theIncome-tax   Authorities   and	the   Income-tax   AppellateTribunal.   The	 High Court differed from the  Tribunal	 andheld  that the firm should be registered.  On appeal by	 theCommissioner of Income-tax,Held, that the Rules framed under S. 26A quite clearly	showthat a minor who is admitted to the benefits of	 partnershipneed  not sign- the application for registration..  The	 lawrequires  all partners to sign the application, and  if	 thedefinition  were to be carried to the extreme, even a  minorwho  is	 admitted to  the benefits of partnership  would  becompetent  to sign such an application.	 The  definition  isdesigned to confer equal benefits upon the minor by treatinghim  as	 a  partner;  but it does  not	render	 a  minor  acompetent    and full partner.	For that purpose, the law  ofPartnership must be considered, apart from the definition inthe Income-tax Act.Section 30 of the Indian Partnershi  Act clearly lays downthat a minor...cannot  become  a partner, I tough  with	 theconsent of the adult.....partners, he may be admitted to thebenefits of partnership. .....Any document which goes beyondthis section cannot be regarded as valid for the  purpose ofregistration.	Registration  can  only	 be  granted  of   adocument  between persons who are parties to it and  on	 thecovenants  set	out in it.  If	the  Income-tax	 Authoritiesregister the:partnership as between the adults only contraryto the terms of the document, in substance a new contract ismade  out.  It is tot open to the Incometax  Authorities  toregister a document which is different from the one actuallyexecuted and asked to be registered.Hoosen	Kassam Dada v.

Rajagopala Ayyangar and D. Gupta, for theappellant.Rameshwar  Nath,  S. N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji and  P.  L.Vohra, for the respondent.1960.	December 1. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH,  J.-The  Commissioner of Incometax  has  filedthis  appeal, with special leave, against the  judgment	 andorder  of the High Court of Bombay, by which the High  Courtanswered  two  questions  referred to it in  favour  of	 therespondents, Messrs.  Dwarkadas Khetan & Co., Bombay.  Thesequestions were:"(1)  Whether the instrument of partnership dated  27-3-1946created a deed of partnership?(2)..If the answer to question No. 1 is in the	affirmative,whether	 the  fact  that on 1-1-1946 there was	no  firm  inexistence would be fatal to the application for registrationof  the firm under Section 26A of the Indian Income-tax	 Actor whether the firm could be registered with effect from 26-3-1946 if it is held that the firm was genuine?"Prior to January 1, 1945, there was a firm called  DwarkadasKhetan & Co. On that date, the firm ceased to exist, becausethe other partners had previously withdrawn, and it came  tobe  the	 sole proprietary concern of Dwarkadas	Khetan.	  OnFebruary  12,  1946, Dwarkadas Khetan obtained	the  sellingagency of Seksaria Cotton Mills, Ltd.  On March 27, 1946, heentered into a partnership, with three others823by  an instrument of partnership executed that	day.   Thosethree  others were Viswanath Purumul, Govindram	 Khetan	 andKantilal   Kasherdeo.	Dwarkadas  Khetan's  share  in	 thepartnership was 7 annas in the rupee, while the remaining  9annas'	share  was divided equally among the  three  others.Though Kantilal Kasherdeo was a minor, he was admitted as  afull partner and not merely to the benefits of the  partner-ship,  as required by s. 30 of the Indian  Partnership	Act.To  the	 instrument of partnership, Kantilal  Kasherdeo	 wasalso  a	 signatory, though immediately after  his  signaturethere was the signature of one Kasherdeo Rungta, the naturalguardian   of  the  minor.   In	 the  instrument,   KantilalKasherdeo was described as a full partner entitled not	onlyto  a share in the profits but also liable to bear  all	 thelosses including loss of capital.  It was also provided thatall the four partners were to attend to the business, and ifconsent was needed, all the partners including the minor hadto  give  their	 consent in writing.   The  minor  was	alsoentitled  to  manage  the affairs  of  the  firm,  includinginspection of the account books, and was given the right  tovote, if a decision on votes had to be taken.  In short,  nodistinction  was  made between the adult  partners  and	 theminor, and to all intents and purposes, the minor was a fullpartner, even though under the partnership law he could onlybe admitted to the benefits of the partnership and not as  apartner.The deed of partnership was produced before the Registrar ofFirms  showing	the  names  of	the  four  partner,%.	 TheRegistrar  of Firms granted a registration certificate,	 andin  the certificate, Kantilal Kasherdeo was shown as a	fullpartner	 and not as one entitled merely to the	benefits  ofthe,, partnership.  Banks were also informed about the	fourpartners,  and. it does not appear that to  them  intimationwas sent that one of the named partners was a minor.  Thoughthe  partnership came into existence on March 27, 1946,	 thefirm was stated to have started retrospectively from January1,  1946.   It	may be pointed out that	 the  firm  has	 thecalendar year as its account year, and the matter before  usrefers	to  the	 account year,	1946  corresponding  to	 theassessment year, 1947-48.824For  purposes  of that year, registration of  the  firm	 wassought	under  s.  26A of the Indian  Income-tax  Act.	 TheIncome-tax  Officer  refused to accord registration  on	 theground that a minor had been admitted as a partner  contraryto  law,  and  that  the  deed	could  not,  therefore,	  beregistered.    The   appeal  to	 the   Appellate   AssistantCommissioner  also  failed, the	 Commissioner  holding	thatregistration could only be of a legal or valid document	 andnot  of a document which was invalid in law.  An appeal	 wasthen  taken to the Tribunal, and it was contended  that	 thedocument  must be construed as showing only that  the  minorwas  admitted not as a full partner but to the	benefits  ofthe partnership.  The Accountant Member hold that the  orderof the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was correct,  givingtwo reasons.  The first was that the construction sought  tobe  placed upon the document was not open, and	the  second,that  since  retrospective operation was given to  the	firmeven   though  no  firm	 existed  from	January	  1,   1946,registration  could  not be granted.   The  Judicial  Memberdiffered  from	the  Accountant	 Member,  holding,  as	 wascontended,  that the document must be construed	 as  showingmerely	that the minor had been admitted to the benefits  ofthe  partnership.   The appeal was then	 placed	 before	 thePresident, who agreed with the conclusion of the  AccountantMember,	 with  the result that the refusal to  register	 thefirm under s. 26A by the authorities was upheld.Two  questions were then posed for the decision of the	HighCourt.	 The  High  Court differed from	 the  Tribunal,	 andanswered  both the questions in favour of the assessee.	  Inso  far as the second question is concerned, the  matter  isnow settled by the decision of this Court in B. C. Mitter  &Sons  v.  Commissioner	of  Income-tax	(1).   But,  in	 ouropinion,  the  decision	 of  the High  Court  on  the  firstquestion  was not correct, and the correct answer  does	 notleave the second quest-ion open at all.There  is  a  distinct cleavage of opinion  among  the	HighCourts on this point.  The Bombay, Madras and(1) [1959] 36 I.T. R. 194.825Patna  High Courts have held that where a minor is  admittedas  a  full partner by adult partners, the document  can  beregistered after interpreting it to mean that the minor	 hasbeen  admitted to the benefits of partnership and not  as  afull  partner.	 The  Calcutta, Allahabad  and	Punjab	HighCourts	have taken a contrary view.  The Bombay case is	 theone which is under appeal, and the Patna High Court followedthat  decision and the two earlier decisions of	 the  MadrasHigh Court.  The Madras High Court decisions are of the sameDivisional Bench, and were pronounced on the same day.	 Theleading	 case  in support of the respondents is	 the  Madrasdecision reported in Jakka Devayya and Sons v.	Commissionerof  Income-tax	(1),  and  that	 case  alone  needs  to	  beconsidered,  because all the reasons on which the  cases  onthis  side  have proceeded are given there.  In	 that  case,there  were three partners, one of whom was a  minor.	Theyformed	 a  Hindu  undivided  family;  later,  a   deed	  ofpartnership was executed in which the minor was	 representedby  his father-in-law.	It was held that the fact  that	 theminor was included as a partner did not make the partnershipas  between  the two adult partners invalid,  and  that	 theminor  must be deemed to have been admitted to the  benefitsof  the partnership by the two adults.	The  learned  Judgesreferred  to the provision of s. 2 (6-B) of  the  Income-taxAct, where it is provided:"  "Partner" includes any person who being a minor has	beenadmitted to the benefits of partnership;",and  observed that in view of this definition and  the	factthat   a  minor	 could	be  admitted  to  the  benefits	  ofpartnership  under s. 30, the document was not invalid,	 butmust be read as giving to the minor the rights laid down  bythe  Partnership Act.  They also observed that too  rigid  aconstruction need not be put upon the deed, and referred  toLindley on Partnership, 11th Edn., p. 87 and A. Khorasany v.C.  Acha and Others (2).  The other cases which we need	 notexamine are Vincent and Others v. Commissioner of(1) [1952] 22 I.T.R. 264.(2) (1928) I.L.R. 6 Ran. 198.826Income-tax     and Sahai Brothers v. Commissioner of Income-taxOn the other hand, there is a decision of the Calcutta	HighCourt  reported	 in Hoosen Kassam Dada	v.  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax,  Bengal (3), in which Costello  and	 Panckridge,JJ.  have held that under s. 26A of the Income-tax  Act	 andthe  Rules,  the Income-tax Officer is	only.  empowered  toregister a partnership which is specified in the  instrumentof partnership and of which registration is asked for.	 Thelearned	 Judges, therefore, hold that it is not open to	 theDepartment  to	'register partnership  different  from	thatwhich is formed by the instrument.  In Hardutt Ray  GajadharRam v. Commissioner of Income-tax(4) Malik, C. J. and  Seth,J.  hold  that where a minor is admitted as a  full  partnerwith  equal rights and obligations with adults, the deed  isinvalid.   It  is pointed out that the English	law  on	 thesubject is different.  In that case, however, there was	 oneother  ground for invalidating the deed, because  the  minorhad been adopted into another family and his natural  fatherwho had signed as his guardian in the deed could not do	 so,as he had ceased to be the natural guardian.  The  decision,however, supports the case of the Commissioner.In  Banka Mal Lajja Ram & Co. v. Commissioner of  Income-tax(5),  it is held that a minor cannot be a partner, and	thatthe partnership which admits a minor as full partner  cannotbe registered.	It is true that in that case the High  Courtdid not consider the question whether the partnership shouldhave. been taken to be a valid partnership consisting of theadult partners, because no such question was referred.	 Thedecision,  however, is against a claim for  registration  ofsuch a document.In our opinion, the Calcutta vie' is preferable to the	viewtaken  by  the Madras High Court.  The error in	 the  Madrasview  is  in  using  the definition  to	 show  that  a	deedincluding a minor as a competent partner(1)[1952] 22 I.T.R. 285.(3)[1937] 5  I.T.R. 182.(2)[1950] 33 I.T.R. 40.(4)[1950] 18 I.T.R. 106.(5)[1953] 24 I.T.R. 150.827is  valid.  What the definition does is to apply to a  minoradmitted to the benefits of partnership all the 2 provisionsof   the  Income-tax  Act  applicable  to   partners.	 Thedefinition cannot be read to mean that in every case where aminor has, contrary to law, been admitted as a full partner,the deed is to be regarded as valid, because, under the law,a minor can be admitted to the benefits of partnership.	 TheRules which have been framed under s. 26A quite clearly showthat a minor who is admitted to the benefits of	 partnershipneed  not  sign the application for registration.   The	 lawrequires  all partners to sign the application, and  if	 thedefinition  were to be carried to the extreme, even a  minorwho  is	 admitted to the benefits of  partnership  would  becompetent  to sign such an application.	 The  definition  isdesigned to confer equal benefits upon the minor by treatinghim as a partner; but it does not render a minor a competentand full partner.  For that purpose, the law of	 Partnershipmust be considered, apart from the definition in the Income-tax Act.Section	 30 of the Indian Partnership Act clearly lays	downthat  a	 minor	cannot become a	 partner,  though  with	 theconsent	 of  the adult partners, he may be admitted  to	 thebenefits  of  partnership.  Any document which	goes  beyondthis section cannot be regarded as valid for the purpose  ofregistration.	Registration  can  only	 be  granted  of   adocument  between persons who are parties to it and  on	 thecovenants  set	out in it.  If	the  Income-tax	 Authoritiesregister the partnership as between the adults only contraryto the terms of the document, in substance a new contract ismade  out.  It is not open to the Income-tax authorities  toregister a document which is different from the one actuallyexecuted  and asked to be registered.  In our  opinion,	 theMadras view cannot be accepted.The judgment under appeal has followed the Madras view, and,in  our opinion, it falls into the same error in  which	 theMadras	High  Court had fallen earlier.	 The answer  to	 thefirst  question should, therefore, have been in	 favour	 ;ofthe  Department.   The	answer given by the  High  Court  isvacated, and828the  question  will  now be answered in	 the  negative.	  Asalready	 stated,  there	 is no need  to	 answer	 the  secondquestion, which does not arise.The appeal is allowed with costs here and in the High Court.				       Appeal allowed.
