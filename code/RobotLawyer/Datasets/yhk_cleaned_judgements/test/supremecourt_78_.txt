November 15.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH,  J.-The State of Bombay has appealed  to	thisCourt with special leave, against an order of the Sales	 TaxTribunal,  Bombay,  dated  December 6, 1957,  by  which	 theTribunal  allowing the appeal before it, set aside an  orderof  the	 Collector of Sales Tax passed under s.	 27  of	 theBombay Sales Tax Act, 1953.The  respondents,  Ratilal Vadilal & Bros.,  are  commissionagents doing business as clearing and transport contractors.On  June  25, 1954, they applied to the Collector  of  SalesTax,  Bombay,  under  ss.  27(a), (b) and  (c)	of  the	 Actdescribing the nature of their business, citing one instancethereof,  for  determination of the  question  whether	theycould be called "dealers " within the Act.  The Collector byhis order held that they were dealers, and were required  toregister themselves under the Act.  On appeal, the  Tribunalheld  otherwise,  and  hence this appeal  by  the  State  ofBombay.369It appears that no action was taken to ask for 'a  referenceto  the	 High Court of Bombay under s. 34(1) read  with	 ss.30(1)  and (2) of the Act.  We have frequently noticed	thatall  the  remedies which are open to an	 appellant  are	 notfirst exhausted before moving this Court.  Ordinarily,	thisCourt  will not allow the High Court to be bypassed in	thismanner, and the proper course for an appellant is to exhaustall  his remedies before invoking the jurisdiction  of	thisCourt  under  Art. 136.	 In the present case,  however,	 thematter is simple, and the learned counsel for the respondentrequested  us  to determine the question, stating  that	 hisclient	who was a small trader and who made the	 applicationfor  the clarification of the law, would be dragged  throughCourts once again, if we were to decide this appeal on	thisshort point.  In view of this, though we decide this appeal,we  must  not be held to lay down a cursus curiae  for	thisCourt.The  matter  relates to a time after  the  Colliery  ControlOrder,	1945, came into force.	Under that Order, no  personcould acquire or purchase coal from a colliery except  underauthority of the Central Government for which purpose he hadto  obtain  a  priority	 certificate  from  the	 State	CoalController.   Under  the scheme of the	Order,	del  credereagents were allowed to act and to charge a commission of onerupee per ton of coal.One Nanalal Karsandas, a brick manufacturer, was allotted  apriority  certificate in respect of 22 tons of coal on	June17, 1954.  He dealt with M/s.  S.C. Rungta Colliery, Burhar,through the respondents.  The consignment was in the name ofKarsandas,  but	 the bill was sent by the  Colliery  to	 therespondents, and the respondents, in their turn, made out  abill in which they charged, in addition to the amount of thebill  of the Colliery, a sum of Rs. 22 as their	 commission.The   liability	 to  pay  the  Colliery	 rested	  upon	 therespondents,   but  they  claimed  to  be  acting  as	mere"middlemen  "  between	the  Colliery  and  Karsandas.	 Therespondents stated that their business was along these lineswith  other  constituents also, and asked the  Collector  todetermine  whether  they  could be  described  as  "dealers"within the Act, and required registration.370"Dealer	 " in the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953, is defined  asfollows:"dealer	 " means any person who carries on the	business  ofselling	  goods	 in  the  State	 of  Bombay,   whether	 forcommission,   remuneration  or	otherwise..."	(Explanationomitted).It  would appear that to be a dealer, the person must  carryon  the	 business of selling goods in the State	 of  Bombay.The short question in this case, therefore, was whether	 therespondents  were carrying on such a business in respect  ofcoal.The  scheme of the Control Order shows that no sale of	coalcould  take place except to a person holding a	certificate.A sale otherwise was in contravention of the Control  Order.The certificate which has been produced in the case,  thoughmade out in the name of the respondents, shows the  consumeras  the consignee.  It is thus plain that there was no	saleby the Colliery to the respondents, but directly to  Karsan-das,  though  through the agency of  the  respondents.	 Therespondents also, when they made out the bill to  Karsandas,mentioned that he was the consignee, and that they were onlycharging   their  "  middlemen	"  commission.	  In   thesecircumstances,	it  is difficult to hold that  the  Collierysold  coal to the respondents, and that they, in turn,	soldit  to Karsandas.  There were no two sales  involved;  therewas  only  one	sale, and that was by the  Colliery  to	 theconsumer.   The respondents never became owners by  purchasefrom the Colliery, because the Colliery would not have	soldcoal to them, nor could they have bought it unless they	 hadobtained a certificate.	 The position of the respondents wasmerely	that  of agents, arranging the sale to	a  disclosedpurchaser,  though guaranteeing payment to the	Colliery  onbehalf of their principal.  In view of what we have said, nobusiness of selling coal was disclosed in the instance citedbefore	the  Collector, and the order of  the  Tribunal	 wascorrect on the facts placed before it.In  the result, the appeal fails and will be dismissed	withcosts.Appeal dismissed.			    371
