The decree	 wasnot  drawn up and the respondents were supplied a  certifiedcopy of the judgment and the memo of costs.  The respondentsfiled an appeal before the High Court without the  certifiedcopy  of the decree and only with the certified copy of	 thejudgment  and  the memo of costs.  The appeal  was  admittedunder  0.  41, r. 11 Code of Civil Procedure on	 August	 30,1954.	On December 23, 1958, the appellant served a  noticeon  the	 respondents  that  he	would  raise  a	 preliminaryobjection at the hearing that the appeal was incompetent  asa certified copy of the decree was not filed as required  by0. 41, r. 1. On December 24, 1958, the respondents moved thetrial  Court  for drawing up of the decree,  but  since	 therecord was in the High Court this could not be done.  At thehearing of the appeal, the appellant raised the	 preliminaryobjection,  but the High Court passed an order	on  December15,  1959,  allowing the respondents one  month's  time	 forgetting a decree drawn up and obtaining. a copy and directedthe  record  to be sent to the trial  Court.   Against	thisorder the appellant preferred an appeal to the Supreme Courtcontending  that  the High Court was bound  to	dismiss	 theappeal	as it was manifestly incompetent under 0. 41, r.  1.Subsequently, on December 23, 1959, the respondents obtaineda certified copy of the decree and filed it before the	HighCourt the same day.  The appellant contended that the appealwas  to	 be  deemed to be filed on this date  and  was	timebarred.Held,  that  in	 the circumstances of this  case  the  orderpassed by the High Court was right.' There was no doubt that0. 41, r. 1  was  mandatory  and in the absence	 of  or	 thedecree the filing of	 the	appeal	  was	 incomplete,defective  and incompetent.  The office of the	trial  Courtwas  negligent in not drawing up a decree and the office  ofthe  High  Court was also not as careful as it	should	havebeen  in  examining the appeal and  these  have	 contributedsubstantially to the unfortunate position.  In such a  case,the respondents deserved to be protected.  Besides the,919question had become academic and technical in view of subse-quent events.  The certified copy of the decree was filed onDecember 23, 1959, and even if the appeal was considered  tohave been filed on that date, it was within time.  Under  s.12(2) of the Limitation Act the respondents could treat	 thetime  taken  in	 the  drawing up of  the  decree  after	 theapplication  for a certified copy thereof had been  made  aspart  of the time taken in obtaining the certified  copy  ofthe decree.Tarabati  Koer v.

F.Appeal No. 77-D of 1954.G. S. Pathak and B. C. Misra, for the appellant.Mukat  Behari Lal Bhargava and J. P. Goyal, for	 respondentsNos. 1 to 7.1960.	December 5. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyGAJENDRAGADKAR,	 J.-The short question of law( which  arisesfor  decision  in, the present appeal by  special  leave  iswhether	 the  appeal  preferred against	 the  appellant	 andrespondents  8	and  9	in  the	 High  Court  of  Punjab  byrespondents  2	to  7 'was competent in law  or	 not.	Thisquestion  arises unDer somewhat unusual	 circumstances.	  Itappears	 that an agreement of sale of one third of  the	 onefourth	share  in the property covered by the  document	 wasentered into between Gokal Dhish Bhargava and the  appellantJagat Dhish Bhargava.  Gokal Dhish Bhargava sued the  appel-lant  and  pro	forms  respondents  8  and  9  for  specificperformance  of the said agreement of sale in the  Court  ofthe Senior Civil Judge, New Delhi (Civil Suit No. 684/128 of1949/50).  This suit was dismissed on920March 12, 1954. , Pending decision in the trial court  GokalDhish  Bhargava	 (fled	and his son  Jawahar  Lal  Bhargava,respondent  1  and Chunni Lal Bhargava were brought  on	 therecord	as  legal  representatives.   After  the  suit	 wasdismissed and before the appeal in question was preferred inthe   High  Court  Chunni  Lal	Bhargava   died;   thereuponrespondents  2	to 7, as his legal  representatives,  joinedrespondent 1 in preferring an appeal against the said decreein the High Court of Punjab.  The memo of appeal along	withthe judgment dismissing the suit and the taxed bill of costsendorsed  on the back of the last page of the  judgment	 wasfiled  in  the	High  Court on July 29,	 1954.	 It  is	 thecompetence  of	this appeal that was questioned	 before	 theHigh  Court  and  is in dispute before	us  in	the  presentappeal.The  record shows that on March 24,1954, an application	 wasmade  by  respondents  2  to  7	 (who  will  be	 called	 therespondents hereafter) for a certified copy of the  judgmentand decree passed in the said suit for specific performance.A  certified copy of the judgment and the bill of costs	 wassupplied to them but the decree had not been drawn up and nocopy  of the decree was therefore supplied to them.  In	 theresult	the appeal was filed without the certified  copy  ofthe decree and only with the certified copy of the  judgmentand  the  bill of costs.  On August 2, 1954,  the  AssistantRegistrar  of  the High Court returned the  memo  of  appealfiled by the respondents to their counsel and pointed out tohim  that'  since no copy of the decree had been  filed	 thepresentation  of  the appeal was defective  and	 the  defectneeded to be rectified.	 Thereafter, on August 16, 1954, therespondents' counsel refiled the appeal with an	 endorsementthat  a memo of costs alone had been prepared by  the  trialcourt  and  no decree had been drawn up, and so	 the  appealshould	be  held  to be	 properly  filed.   Apparently	thisexplanation  was treated' as satisfactory by the  office  ofthe High Court and the appeal was registered as No. 77-D  of1954.In due course the appeal was placed for preliminary  hearingunder 0. 41, r. 11 of the Code of Civil921Procedure  before  Dulat, J. who admitted it on	 August	 30,1954.	Notice of the appeal was accordingly served  on	 theappellant  and the pro forma respondents.   Ultimately	whenthe  appeal  became ready for hearing it was put up  on	 theBoard of the Circuit Bench of the High Court to be heard  onDecember  26,  1958.  Meanwhile on December 23.,  1958,	 theappellant  served  a  notice  on  the  respondents'  counselintimating  to him that he proposed to raise  a	 preliminaryobjection against the competence of the appeal on the groundthat the decree under appeal had not been filed as  requiredunder  0.  41, r. 1 along with the memo of  appeal  and	 thecertified copy of the judgment.	 Next day, that is to say onDecember 24, 1958, the respondents moved the trial Court fordrawing	 up of the decree, but since the record had  in	 themeantime  been sent by the trial Court to the High Court  nodecree	could  be drawn up by the trial Court,	and  so	 themotion	became	infructuous.  The appeal, however,  did	 notreach  hearing on December 26, 1958.  On December 29,  1958,the  respondents moved the Court that the appeal  should  bedeclared to be maintainable as the memo of costs which alonehad  been  prepared by the trial Court read along  with	 theconcluding paragraph of the judgment may be held to  satisfythe  requirements  of the decree; in  the  alternative	theyprayed that the record of the suit in the trial Court shouldbe  sent for to enable them to get a decree prepared with  aview  to  file the same in the High Court along	 with  theirappeal.	 Bishan Narain, J., before whom this application wastaken  out for orders, directed that it may be heard by	 theBench which would hear the appeal.Eventually the appeal came on for hearing before Falshaw andChopra,	 JJ. on De ember 8, 1959.  At the said	hearing	 theappellant raised a preliminary objection that the appeal wasnot  competent having regard to the mandatory provisions  of0.  41, r. 1, and urged that the appeal should be  dismissedas  incompetent.  This preliminary objection  was,  however,not  upheld  by the High Court, and it was  held  that	"theproper course to follow was to allow the respondents a922month's time for the purpose of getting a decree drawn up inthe  proper  form by the lower Court and  obtaining  a	copythereof ". Accordingly the record which had in the meanwhilebeen  received	by  the	 High Court  after  the	 appeal	 wasadmitted under 0. 41, r. 11  was ordered to be sent back  tothe  lower  Court without delay.  It is against	 this  orderwhich  was  passed by the High Court on December  15,  1959,that the present appeal by special leave has been filed.  Onbehalf of the appellant Mr. Pathak contends that the  appealfiled  before  the  High Court was  plainly  and  manifestlyincompetent,  and  so  the High Court was in  error  in	 notdismissing it on that ground.The  position of law under 0. 41, r. 1 is absolutely  clear.Under the said rule every appeal has to be preferred in	 theform of a memorandum signed by the appellant or his  pleaderand presented to the Court or to such officer as it appointsin  that behalf, and has to be accompanied by a copy of	 thedecree	appealed  from, and of the judgment on which  it  isfounded.   Rule 1 empowers the appellate Court	to  dispensewith the filing of the judgment but there is no jurisdictionin  the appellate Court to dispense with the filing  of	 thedecree.	 Where the decree consists of different distinct andseverable directions enforceable against the same or severaldefendants the Court may permit the filing of such  portionsof  the decree as are the subject matter of the	 appeal	 butthat  is  a problem with which we are not concerned  in	 thepresent case.  In law the appeal is not so much against	 thejudgment  as against the decree; that is why Article 156  ofthe  Limitation Act prescribes a period of 90 days for	suchappeals	 and provides that the period commences to run	fromthe date of the decree under appeal.  Therefore there is  nodoubt that the requirements that the decree should be  filedalong with the memorandum of appeal is mandatory, and in theabsence	 of  the decree the filing of the  appeal  would  beincomplete, defective and incompetent.That, however, cannot finally dispose of the point raised bythe   appellant	 before	 us.   In  the	present	  case	 therespondents had applied for a certified copy of923the  judgment  as well as the decree in the trial  Court  onMarch 24, 1954, and they were not given a copy of the decreefor the simple reason that no decree was drawn up; what theywere  given  was a copy of the judgment and  taxed  bill  ofcosts endorsed on the back of the last page of the judgment.These documents	 they filed along with their memo of appeal;but  that would not affect the mandatory requirement  of  0.41,  r. 1. In considering the effect of this defect  in	 thepresentation of the appeal we must bear in mind the rules ofprocedure  in regard to the drawing up of the  decree.	 Theposition in that behalf is absolutely clear.  Section 33  ofthe  Code of Civil Procedure requires that the Court,  afterthe  case has been heard, shall pronounce judgment,  and  onsuch  judgment	a  decree  shall follow.   Order  20,  r.  3provides,  inter alia, that the judgment shall be dated	 andsigned	by  the	 judge	in the open Court  at  the  time  ofpronouncing it, and under r. 4, sub-r. (2) a judgment has tocontain	 a  concise statement of the case,  the	 points	 fordetermination, the decision thereon and the reasons for suchdecision.   Rule  6 of the same Order  prescribes  the	con.tents  of  the decree.	It provides that  the  decree  shallagree  with the judgment and shall contain  the	 particularstherein	 specified.   Under  r. 7 it is	 provided  that	 thedecree	shall bear the date, the day on which  the  judgmentwas  pronounced,  and  it directs that when  the  judge	 hassatisfied  himself  that  the decree has been  drawn  up  inaccordance  with the judgment he shall sign the decree.	  Itis,  therefore, clear that the drawing up of the  decree  inthe  present  case  was the function and  the  duty  of	 theoffice,	 and it was obligatory on the judge to	examine	 thedecree	when  drawn up, and if satisfied that  it  has	beenproperly  drawn up to sign it.	Except in places  where	 thedual  system prevails the litigant or his lawyer'  does	 notplay any material or important part in the drawing up of thedecree.	 In fact the process of drawing up of the' decree isbeyond the litigant's control.	Therefore, there is no doubtwhatever that in failing to draw up a decree in the  presentsuit  the  office of the trial Court was  negligent  in	 thedischarge of its duties, and924the  said  negligence was not even noticed  by	the  learnedtrial judge himself.Unfortunately,	when  the appeal was presented in  the	HighCourt, even the office of the High Court was not as  carefulin examining the appeal as it should ,,have been, and as  wehave  already indicated the appeal passed through the  stageof  admission under 0. 41, r. 11 without the defect  in	 theappeal being brought to the notice of the learned judge	 whoadmitted it.  Thus it is quite clear on the record that	 therespondents had applied for a certified copy of the judgmentand  the decree, and when they were given only	a  certifiedcopy  of the judgment and the bill of costs they  filed	 thesame  along with the memo of appeal in the bona fide  beliefthat  the said documents would meet the requirements  of  0.41,  r.	 1. It is true that before the appeal  came  on	 foractual	hearing	 before the High Court	the  appellant	gavenotice	to  the respondents about his intention to  raise  apreliminary objection that the appeal had not been  properlyfiled; but, as we have already pointed out, the attempt madeby  the respondents to move the trial Court to draw  up	 thedecree	proved	infructuous and ultimately  the	 High  Courtthought that in.fairness to the respondents they ought to beallowed time to obtain the certified copy of the decree	 andfile  it before it; and so the High Court passed  the  orderunder  appeal.	 The appellant contends that this  order  ismanifestly erroneous in law; according to him the only orderwhich  could and should have been passed was to dismiss	 theappeal as incompetent under 0. 41, r.1.The problem thus posed by the appellant for our decision hasnow  become academic because subsequent to the	decision  ofthe  High  Court under appeal the respondents have  in	factobtained  Po  certified copy of the decree on  December	 23,1959,  and have filed it in the High Court on the same	day.This fact immediately raises the question as to whether	 theappeal	which  has admittedly been completely  and  properlyfiled  on  December  23, 1959, was in time or  not.   If  itappears that on the date when the decree was thus filed the925presentation  of the appeal was in time then  the  objectionraised	by  the	 appellant  against  the  propriety  or	 thecorrectness of the High Court's order under appeal would  bepurely technical and academic.The answer to the question as to whether the presentation ofthe  appeal  on December 23, 1959, is in time or  not  woulddepend	upon  the construction of s. 12, sub-s. (2)  of	 theLimitation  Act.   We have already noticed that	 the  periodprescribed for filing the present appeal is 90 days from thedate of the decree.  Section 12, sub-s. (2) provides,  interalia,  that in computing the period of limitation "the	timerequisite  for	obtaining  a copy of  the  decree  shall  beexcluded".  What then is the time which can be	legitimatelydeemed	to  have been taken for obtaining the  copy  of	 thedecree in the present case?  Where a decree is not drawn  upimmediately  or	 soon after a judgment	is  pronounced,	 twotypes  of cases may arise.  A litigant feeling aggrieved  bythe  decision  may  apply  for the  certified  copy  of	 thejudgment and decree before the decree is drawn up, or he mayapply  for  the said decree after it is drawn  up.   In	 theformer	case, where the litigant has done all that he  couldand  has  made	a  proper  application	for  obtaining	 thenecessary  copies,  the	 time requisite	 for  obtaining	 thecopies must necessarily include not only the time taken	 forthe  actual supply of the certified copy of the	 decree	 butalso  for  the drawing up of the decree	 itself.   In  otherwords, the time taken by the office or the Court in  drawingup  a decree after a litigant has applied for its  certifiedcopy  on  judgment being pronounced, would be treated  as  apart  of the time taken for obtaining the certified copy  ofthe  said  decree.  Mr. Pathak has fairly conceded  that  onthis point there is a consensus of judicial opinion, and  inview  of  the formidable and imposing array  of	 authoritiesagainst	 him  he  did not raise	 any  contention  about	 thevalidity  of  the  view	 take in  all  those  cases.  (Vide:Tarabati Koer v. Lala Jagdeo Narain (1); Bani Madhub  Mitterv. Mathungini Dassi & Ors. (Full Bench) (2);GabrielChristian v.(1) (1911) 15 C.W.N. 787.(2) (1886) I.L.R. 13 Cal- 104.926Chandra	  Mohan	  Missir  (Full	 Bench)	  (1);	 JayashankarMulshankar Mehta v. Mayabhai Lalbhai Shah (Full Bench)	(2);Gokul  Prasad  v.  Kunwar Bahadur &  Ors.(3);  and  Umda  v.Rupchand & Ors. (Nagpur Full Bench) (1)).There  is, however, a sharp difference of opinion in  regardto  cases where an application for a certified copy  of	 thedecree	is  made  after the said decree	 is  drawn  up.	  Indealing	 with  such cases Courts have differed	as  to	whatwould  be the period requisite for obtaining  the  certifiedcopy  of  the decree.  The Bombay, Calcutta and	 Patna	HighCourts, appear to have held that the period taken in drawingup  of	the decree would be part of  the  requisite  period,while  other High Courts have taken a contrary view.  It  issignificant  that though the High Courts have thus  differedon  this point, in every case an attempt is judicially	madeto do justice between the parties.  With that aspect of	 theproblem,  however,  we	are not	 concerned  in	the  presentappeal.The position, therefore, is that when the certified copy  ofthe decree was filed by the respondents in the High Court onDecember 23, 1969, the whole of the period between the	dateof the application for the certified copy and the date	whenthe  decree  was actually signed would have to	be  excludedunder s. 12, sub-s. (2).  Inevitably the presentation of theappeal	on December 23, 1959 would be in time.	It  is	truethat  more  than  five years have  thus	 elapsed  after	 thepronouncement  of the judgment but for this long  delay	 andlapse  of time the respondents are not much to	blame.	 Thefailure of the trial Court to draw up the decree as well  asthe failure of the relevant department in the High Court  toexamine the defect in the presentation of the appeal at	 theinitial stage have contributed substantially to the  presentunfortunate position.  In such a case there can be no  doubtthat  the  litigant  deserves to be  protected	against	 thedefault	 committed or negligence shown by the Court  or	 itsofficers  in the discharge of their duties.  As observed  byCairnes, L. C. in Rodger v. Comptoir(1) (1936) I.L.R. 15 Pat. 284.(2) (1951) 54 B.L.R. II.(3) (1935) I.L.R. 10 Lucknow 250.(4) (1926) 98 I.C. 1057.927d'Escompte  de Paris (1) as early as 1871 "one of the  firstand  highest duties of all Courts is to take care  that	 theact of the Court does no injury to any of the suitors"; thatis  why we think that in view of the subsequent event  whichhas  happened  in  this	 case, namely,	the  filing  of	 thecertified  copy	 of  the  decree in  the,  High	 Court,	 thequestion  raised by the appellant has( become technical	 andacademic.Faced with this position Mr. Pathak attempted to argue	thatthe  application made by the respondents on March 24,  1954,was  not really an application for a certified copy  of	 thedecree;	 he  contendea that it was an  application  for	 thecertified copy of the judgment and the bill of costs.	Thisargument  is  wholly  untenable.   The	words  used  in	 theapplication  clearly show that it was an application  for  acertified  copy	 of  the judgment as well  as  the  decretalorder, and as subsequent events have shown, a certified copyof the decree was ultimately supplied to the respondents inpursuance of this application.Then  it was argued that the respondents should	 have  movedthe  trial Court for the drawing up of a decree as  soon  asthey  found  that  no decree a been drawn  up.	 It  may  beassumed that the respondents might have adopted this course;but where the dual system does not exist it would be idle tocontend	 that  it  is a part of the duty of  a	litigant  toremind the Court or its office about its obligation to	drawup  a decree after the judgment is pronounced in  any  suit.It  may	 be  that decrees when drawn up	 are  shown  to	 thelawyers	 of the parties; but essentially drawing up  of	 thedecree	is the function of the Court and its office, and  itwould be unreasonable to penalise a party for the default ofthe  office  by suggesting that it was	necessary  that	 theparty should have moved the Court for the drawing up of	 thedecree.	 Therefore, we are not satisfied that tie  appellantis  justified in attributing to the respondents any  defaultfor  which  the penalty of dismissing their  appeal  can  belegitimately imposed on them.  The result is that the appealpreferred by the respondents on December 23,(1)  (1871) L.R. 3 P.C. 465, 475.9281959, is proper and in time and it can now be dealt with  inaccordance  with law.  It is true that in the  circumstancesover  which  the respondents had no control  the  appeal  inquestion  has already been admitted under 0. 41, r. 11,	 andas a result of the decision under    appeal  it may not haveto  go through that process again.  Dulat, J. who heard	 theappeal	for admission was satisfied that it deserved  to  beadmitted  and we do not think it necessary to  require	thatthe  present appeal should go through the formality  of	 theprocedure prescribed by 0. 41, r. 11 once again.  This posi-tion  is no doubt, unusual, but in the circumstances of	 thecase  it is impossible to say that the order passed  by	 theHigh Court is not fair and just.Let  us	 then  consider the technical point  raised  by	 theappellant  challenging the validity or the propriety of	 theorder  under  appeal.  The argument is that 0. 41, r.  1  ismandatory,  and	 as soon as it is shown that an	 appeal	 hasbeen filed with a memorandum of appeal accompanied only witha  certified  copy  of	the  judgment  the  appeal  must  bedismissed  as being incompetent, the relevant provisions  of0.  41	with regard to the filing of the decree being  of  amandatory character.  It would be difficult to accede to theproposition  thus advanced in a broad and general form.	  Ifat  the	 time  when the appeal is  preferred  a	 decree	 hasalready	 been drawn up by the trial Court and the  appellanthas  not  applied for it in time it would be  a	 clear	casewhere  the  appeal  would be incompetent and  a	 penalty  ofdismissal would be justified.  The position would,  however,be substantially different if at the time when the appeal ispresented  before the appellate Court a decree in  fact	 hadnot  been drawn up by the trial Court; in such a case if  anapplication has been made by the appellant for, a  certifiedcopy  of the decree, then all that can be said	against	 theappeal	preferred  by him is that the  appeal  is  prematuresince  a decree has not been drawn up, and it is the  decreeagainst which an appeal lies.  In such a case, if the officeof  the	 High  Court  examines	the  appeal  carefully	 anddiscovery  the	defect	the appeal may be  returned  to	 theappellant for presentation929with the certified copy of the decree after it is  obtained.In  the	 case  like the present, if the	 appeal	 has  passedthrough	 the  stage of admission through  oversight  of	 theoffice,	 then  the only fair and rational  course  to  adoptwould  be  to  adjourn	the hearing of	the  appeal  with  adirection  that the appellant should produce  the  certifiedcopy  of  the decree as soon as it is supplied to  him.	  Insuch  a	 case  it would be open to the High  Court,  and  weapprehend  it would be its duty, to direct  the	 subordinateCourt to draw up the decree forthwith without any delay.  Onthe  other  hand,  if  a decree has been  drawn	 up  and  anapplication  for  its certified copy has been  made  by	 theappellant  after the decree was drawn up, the office of	 theappellate Court should return the appeal to the appellant asdefective, and when the decree is filed by him the  questionof limitation may be examined on the merits.  It is  obviousthat the complications in the present case have arisen as  aresult	of  two factors; the failure of the trial  Court  todraw up the decree as required by the Code, and the  failureof the office in the High Court to notice the defect and  totake  appropriate  action at the initial  stage	 before	 theappeal	was  placed for admission under 0. 41,	r.  11.	  Itwould  thus be clear that no hard and fast 'rule of  generalapplicability  can  be laid down for  dealing  with  appealsdefectively filed under 0. 41, r. 1. Appropriate orders willhave to be passed having regard to the circumstances of eachcase,  but  the	 most important step to	 take  in  cases  ofdefective  presentation	 of appeals is that they  should  becarefully  scrutinized at the initial stage soon after	theyare filed and the appellant required to remedy the  defects.Therefore, in our opinion, the appellant is not justified inchallenging  the  propriety  or the validity  of  the  orderpassed	by  the High Court because in the  circumstances  towhich  we have already adverted the said order is  obviouslyfair  and  just.  The High Court realised that it  would  bevery unfair to penalise the party for the mistake  committedby  the trial Court and its own office, and so it has  giventime to the respondents to930apply  for a certified copy of the decree and  then  proceedwith the appeal.In this connection our attention has been drawn to the	factthat   in  the	Punjab	High  Court  two   conflicting	 andinconsistent  views  appear  to	 have  been  taken  in	 itsreported  decisions.  Dealing with appeals filed with-out  acertified copy of the decree some decisions have   dismissedthe  appeals  as  defective, and have given  effect  to	 themandatory words in 0. 41, r. 1, without presumably examiningthe question as to whether the failure of the trial Court todraw  up the decree would have any bearing or  relevance  onthe point or not.

On  the  otherhand  it has in some cases been held that it would  be	fairand just that the hearing of the appeal should be  adjournedto  enable the appellant to obtain a certified copy  of	 thedecree	and  produce it before the  appellate  Court  (Vide:Manoharlal  v. Nanak Chand (8); Mt.  Jeewani v.	 Mt.   Misri(9);  and,  Sher Muhammad v. Muhammad Khan (10).   It  wouldobviously  have	 been better if this  conflict	of  judicialopinion in the reported decisions of the High Court had beenresolved  by  a Full Bench of the said High Court  but	thatdoes  not appear to have been done so far.  However,  as  wehave  indicated,  the question about the competence  of	 theappeal	has to be judged in each case on its own  facts	 andappropriate orders must be passed at the initial stage	soonafter  the appeal is presented in the appellate	 Court.	  Ifany disputed question of limitation arises it may have to gobefore the Court for judicial decision.In  the result the order passed by the High Court is  right.Having regard to the fact that the decree(1)  A.I.R. (1920) 1 Lah. 223(3)  A.I.R. (1925) Lah. 438.(5)  A I.R. (1927) Lah. 912.(7)  A.I.R. (1940) East Punj. 400.(9)  A.I.R. (1919) Lah. 125.(2)  A.I.R (1922) Lah. 170.(4)  A. I.R. (1927) Lah. 49.(6)  35 Punj.  L.R. 471.(8)  A.I.R. (1919) Lah. 53.(10) A.I.R. (1924) Lah. 352.931under  appeal  has  already been filed	by  the	 respondentsbefore	the High Court on December 23, 1959, the High  Courtshould now proceed to hear the appeal on the merits and dealwith  it  in accordance with law.  In the  circumstances  ofthis case we make no order as to costs.					 Appeal dismissed.
