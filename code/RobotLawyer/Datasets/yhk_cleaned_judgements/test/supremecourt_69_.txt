Thepresidency Magistrate was satisfied that a working still and516illicit liquor were found.  The appellant No. 1 was examinedunder  section	342 of the Code of  Criminal  Procedure,  hevolunteered  the statement that he did not know anything  ofthe  contraband	 seized	 by  the police	 ;  so	no  specificquestion  about the still and other articles recovered	fromhis  premises  were  put by the	 Presidency  Magistrate	 whoconvicted  the appellants under ss. 65(b), 65(f) & 66(b)  ofthe  Bombay  Prohibition Act, relying on the  facts  of	 therecovery  of  still and illicit liquor and did not  use	 theprovision of S. 103 for presumption against the appellants.The  appellants	 on appeal by special leave  contended,	 (1)that  no presumption under s. 103 of the Act could  arise  ;and  that  he had been denied the opportunity to  rebut	 thepresumption  under s. 103 of the Act, as no  questions	wereput to them when they were examined under s. 342 of the Codeof  Criminal  Procedure (3) that as the Magistrate  had	 notused  the  provision of s. 103 for presumption	against	 theappellants,  the High Court ought not to have convicted	 theappellants  on the presumption arising under s. 103  of	 theAct without giving them an opportunity to rebut the same.On  behalf of appellant No. 2 it was further urged  that  hewas  merely a servant of appellant No. 1; if any one was  inpossession  of	the  still it was appellant  No.  1  and  nopresumption against him could arise under s. 103 of the Act.Held,  that when an accused is examined under s. 342 of	 theCode of Criminal Procedure and volunteers statement  denyingall knowledge of articles recovered from his possession,  noprejudice  is caused to him if no further questions are	 putto explain the possession of articles found in the  premisesoccupied by him.The  presumption  which arises under S. 103  of	 the  BombayProhibition  Act  is  that  an	offence	 under	the  Act  iscommitted when a person is found in mere possession, withoutfurther	 evidence,  of	any  still,  utensil,  implement  orapparatus whatsoever for the manufacture of such  intoxicantuntil  contrary is proved.  Thus no prejudice was caused  tothe  appellant	No. 1 when the High Court  relied  upon	 thepresumption  arising under s. 103 of the Act to	 uphold	 hisconviction under s. 65(f) of the Act.Held, further, that it cannot be said of merely an  employeein  the premises that he was in physical possession  of	 thethings belonging to his master unless they were left in	 hiscustody,Where  an offence under s. 65(f) of the	 Bombay	 ProhibitionAct has not been established beyond reasonable doubt and thepossession of still does not amount to an offence under	 thesection	 no presumption could arise under s. 103 of the	 Actagainst a person that he was in possession of the still	 forwhich he could not account satisfactorily.In the instant case the still being in the possession of themaster and there being no evidence that the employee in any517way  aided his master to come into possession of the  still,it  could not be said that the appellant No. 2 was  in	suchpossession of the still as would amount to an offence  unders. 65(f) of the Act.JUDGMENT:CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 124  of1959.Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and	order  datedJune  19  and 20, 1959, of the former Bombay High  Court  inCriminal Appeal No. 411 of 1959 arising out of the  judgmentand order dated March 17, 1959, of the Presidency MagistrateXX Court, Mazagaon, Bombay in Case Nos. 1952-54/P of 1958.B.

The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyIMAM,  J.-The  appellants were convicted  under	 ss.  65(b),65(f)  and  66(b)  of the Bombay Prohibition  Act  of  1949,hereinafter  referred  to  as the  Act,	 by  the  PresidencyMagistrate XX Court, Mazagaon, Bombay.	The appellant No.  1was sentenced to 9 months' rigorous imprisonment and a	fineof  Rs.	 1,000	under s. 65(b).	 No  separate  sentence	 wasimposed	 under	the  other sections.  Appellant	 No.  2	 wassentenced to 6 months' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.500 under s. 65(b).  No separate sentence was imposed  underthe other sections.  They appealed to the Bombay High  Courtagainst	 their convictions and sentence.The High  Court	 setaside their convictions under ss. 65(b) and 66(b) of the Actbut maintained their conviction under s. 65(f ) read with s.81 relying on the presumption against the appellants arisingout  of	 s.  103 of the Act.   The  High  Court	 accordinglydirected that the sentence of imprisonment and fine  imposedupon  the appellants by the Presidency Magistrate  under  s.65(b)  be regarded as the sentence of imprisonment and	fineimposed on the appellants under s. 65(f)  read with s. 81.66518According to the case of the prosecution, there was a searchon  August 2,1958, of certain premises in the occupation  ofappellant No. 1 on the third floor of Dhun Mansion, Khetwadi12th  Lane.   A complete working still was found  there	 andboth  the appellants were working it.  Appellant No.  2	 waspumping	 air  into  the cylinder with  a  motor	 pump  whileappellant  No. 1 was holding a rubber tube attached  to	 thetank.	An  iron stand with a boiler on it  was	 also  foundthere.	 Below	the  boiler  there was	a  stove  which	 wasburning.   There  was  also  a	big  jar  near	the   still.According to the prosecution, this big jar contained illicitliquor.	  Another  glass jar was used as a  receiver  which,according  to  the prosecution, also contained 20  drams  ofillicit liquor.	 The, boiler contained four gallons of wash.There  were also 11 wooden barrels containing wash.  In	 thedrawing room of the premises a small glass jar containing 20drams of illicit-liquor, a bottle of 1-1/2 drams of  illicitliquor	and  a	pint bottle containing 3  drams	 of  illicitliquor	 were  also  found.   A	 _panchnama  was  drawn	  upconcerning the recovery of these articles.  It was the	caseof  the prosecution that the appellants	 were  manufacturingillicit	 liquor and were in possession of a still and  othermaterials  for the purpose of manufacturing  intoxicant	 andwere also in possession of illicit liquor.The Presidency Magistrate was satisfied that a working stilland  illicit  liquor in the glass jars and the	two  bottleswere found in the premises in question.	 The High Court alsowas of the opinion that a working still was found there	 butit  thought  that  it would not be safe	 to  rely  upon	 theconflicting and unsatisfactory evidence in the case to	holdthat  illicit  liquor  had been found  in  the	premises  inquestion, as it had not been satisfactorily proved that	 thebottles	 and the glass jars had been sealed in the  presenceof  the panchas.  The High Court was further of the  opinionthat  there was no evidence on the record to show  that	 thevery  bottles which were attached and the sample bottles  inwhich  was  contained the wash were the bottles	 which	wereexamined by the Chemical Examiner in respect519of  which he made a report to the Magistrate.	Accordingly,it  was of the opinion that the convictions under ss.  65(b)and 66(b) could not stand.On behalf of the appellants it was urged that no presumptionunder  s.  103	of the Act could arise as it  had  not	beenestablished,  on  the findings of the High Court,  that	 thestill was an apparatus for the manufacture of any intoxicantas is ordinarily used in the manufacture of any	 intoxicant.It  was	 further argued that no questions were	put  to	 theaccused, when they were examined under s. 342 of the Code ofCriminal  Procedure, in this connection and  therefore	theyhad  been denied the opportunity to rebut  the	presumption.The  Presidency Magistrate had not used the provision,,;  ofs.  103 against the appellants because he had found that  infact illicit liquor had been recovered from the premises andthat  the still was for manufacturing such  intoxicant.	  Ifthe  Presidency	 Magistrate had at all intended to  use	 thepresumption  under  s. 103 against the	appellants,  he	 wasbound to have given them an opportunity to rebut it.  If  atthe  appellate stage the High Court was of the opinion	thatit had not been established that any illicit liquor had beenrecovered  as a result of the search, then it ought  not  tohave  convicted	 the appellants on the	presumption  arisingunder s. 103 without giving the appellants an opportunity torebut  the  same.  In this case the offence under  s.  65(f)would be the using, keeping or having in possession a  stillor apparatus for the purpose of manufacturing any intoxicantother  than toddy.  It was not established by  the  evidencethat  the  still or apparatus recovered	 from  the  premisesoccupied by appellant No. 1 was one which is not  ordinarilyused for the manufacture of toddy.It  was further urged on behalf of appellant No. 2  that  hecould not be convicted either for being in possession of thestill  or  under s. 65(f) read with s. 81, that is  to	say,abetment  of  an offence under s. 65(f) of  the	 Act.	Thisappellant  was merely a servant of appellant No. 1.  If	 anyone  was in possession of the still it was appellant No.  1.There was also no evidence to show that appellant No. 2	 hadabetted520appellant  No.	1 in coming into possession  of	 the  still.Appellant No. 2 was merely using the pump, presumably  underthe orders of his master, and as he could not be said to  bein  possession	of the still, no  presumption  against	thisappellant could arise under s.	   103 of the Act.We would deal with the case of appellant No. 2 first.  Thereis  no evidence that he in any way aided his master to	comeinto  possession  of the still.	 It would be  reasonable  tosuppose	 that when he was using the pump he was doing so  onthe  orders of his master and he may not have been aware  ofwhat  was being manufactured, whatever suspicion  may  arisefrom  his  conduct.  It cannot also be said that he  was  inpossession of the still.  The still was in the possession ofhis  master.  He was merely an employee in the premises	 andcannot	be  said  to be in  physical  possession  of  thingsbelonging  to  his  master  unless they	 were  left  in	 hiscustody.   It seems to us that whatever suspicion there	 maybe against the appellant No. 2 it cannot be said that it hasbeen established beyond reasonable doubt that he was in suchpossession of the still as would amount to an offence  unders.  65(f) of the Act.  In the circumstances, no	 presumptioncould arise under s. 103 against him that he was in  posses-sion  of  the still for which he could	not  account  satis-factorily.   We	 would	accordingly  allow  the	 appeal	  ofappellant No. 2 and set aside his conviction and sentence.So far as the appellant No. 1 is concerned, there can be  noquestion  that he was found in possession of a still  which,having regard to the nature of the still as disclosed by theevidence,  is  ordinarily  used for the	 manufacture  of  anintoxicant such as liquor.  Having regard to the descriptionof the still, as found on the record, we are satisfied	thatthe  still  in	question  is not  ordinarily  used  for	 themanufacture of toddy.  Indeed, it is doubtful that any stillis  required for the manufacture of toddy because  toddy  iseither	fermented or not.  If the toddy is  unfermented	 theneed for a still is unnecessary.  On the other hand, if	 thetoddy is fermented, the process of fermentation is a natural521one and does not require the aid of any apparatus to fermentit.   It  was said, however, that by heating  the  toddy,  ahigher	degree	of fermentation takes place and	 it  becomesmore potent.  We have, however, no evidence on the record asto this.  Even if we assume that toddy, when heated, becomeshighly fermented and therefore more potent, there is nothingto show that the heating process to achieve this required anelaborate still of the kind found in the premises ofappellant No. 1.It  was, however, pointed out that no questions were put  tothe  appellant in order to give him an opportunity to  rebutthe  presumption arising out of s. 103 of the Act.   It	 is,however,  to  be  remembered that  when	 the  appellant	 wasexamined  under s. 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  hehad volunteered the statement that he did not know about thevarious contraband seized by the police.  Since this was hisattitude in the matter, it is difficult 'to understand	whatfurther questions could have been put to him to explain	 thepossession of the still and the various other articles foundin the premises occupied by him.  It is not possible to	 sayin  this  particular  case  that  this	appellant  had	beenprejudiced  by the failure of the Magistrate to put  to	 himany  specific  questions  about	 the  still  and  the  otherarticles found in the premises occupied by him.The presumption which arises under s. 103 of the Act is thatan  offence  under the Act is committed where  a  person  isfound  in mere possession, without further evidence, of	 anystill,	utensil, implement or apparatus whatsoever  for	 themanufacture of any intoxicant as are ordinarily used in	 themanufacture of such intoxicant until the contrary is proved.it  is difficult to conceive that the appellant	 could	havegiven any satisfactory evidence to establish that the  stilland  other  articles found in the premises occupied  by	 himcould  ordinarily be used for the manufacture of toddy.	  Weare accordingly satisfied that there was no prejudice causedto the appellant, in the circumstances of the present  case,when  the  High Court relied upon  the	presumption  arisingunder s. 103522to uphold his conviction under s. 65(f) of the Act.It  was finally urged that the sentence should	be  reduced.In  our opinion, the sentence imposed cannot be said  to  beunduly severe having regard to the provisions of the Act.Accordingly,  the appeal of appellant No. 2 is	allowed	 andhis conviction and sentence are set aside but the appeal  ofappellant No. 1 is dismissed.			    Appeal disposed of accordingly.		   ------------------
