N. Kripal and D. Gupta, for the appellant.N. A. Palkhivala and B. P. Maheshwari, for the respondents.1960.  November 24.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyKAPUR,	J. -This is an appeal by special leave	against	 thejudgment and order of the High Court of Bombay in Income-taxReference No. 55 of 1955, in which two questions of law werestated	for opinion and both were answered in favour of	 theassessee  and against the Commissioner of Income-tax who  isthe appellant before us and the assessee is the respondent.The facts of this case are these:The respondent is a registered firm carrying on business  ascommission  agents in Bombay.  For purposes of its  businessit  borrowed  money from time to time from  Banks  on  jointpromissory notes executed by it and by others with joint andseveral	 liability.  On September 26, 1949,  the  respondentborrowed  Rs. 1,00,000 from the Bank of India on  a  pronoteexecuted jointly with one Kishorilal.  Out of this amount  asum  of Rs. 50,000 was taken by the respondent for  purposesof  its	 business and the rest	by  Kishorilal.	  Kishorilalhowever failed to meet his liability and became a  bankrupt.The  respondent	 had  therefore to pay the  Bank  the  wholeamount, i.e., Rs. 1,00,000 with interest.  Out of the amounttaken	by  Kishorilal	the  respondent	 received   in	 theaccounting  year, from the Official Assignee, a sum  of	 Rs.18,805	and  claimed  the  balance,  i.e.,  Rs.	 31,740	  asdeduction.  The accounting year was from August 26, 1949  toJuly  17,  1950, the assessment year  being  1951-52.	Thisclaim was disallowed both by the Income-tax Officer as	wellas  the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.  On Appeal to	 theIncome-tax  Appellate Tribunal this sum was allowed  ,as  anallowable deduction under s. 10(2)(xv) of the Income-tax Actand as business loss.82646At the instance of the Commissioner a case was stated to theHigh Court of Bombay by the Income-tax	Appellate  Tribunal.In  the	 statement of the case which was agreed to  by	bothparties the Tribunal said:"For  the purpose of his business, he borrows from  time  totime  money on joint and several liability from	 banks.	 TheCommercial  practice is to borrow money from banks on  jointand several liability.	An illustration will explain what wemean.  A and B require Rs. 50,000 each.	 They find that	 theBank would not advance Rs. 50,000 to each on his  individualsecurity.   They  however,  find  that	the  Bank  would  beprepared  to  advance  Rupees one lach on  their  joint	 andseveral	 liability.  They take Rupees one lac on  joint	 andseveral liability and then divide the money equally  betweenthemselves."It  also  found	 that  the Banks  advanced  monies  to	someconstituents on their personal security also but they had topay  a	higher	rate of interest than  when  the  money	 wasborrowed  on  joint  and several  responsibility;  that	 Rs.1,00,000  borrowed from the Bank was in accordance with	 thecommercial practice of Bombay.On  these  facts  the following two questions  of  law	werereferred to the High Court:-"(1)  Whether  the assessee's claim  is	 sustainable   undersection 10(2)(xv) of the Act?(2)  Whether  the  assessee's  claim that  the	loss  was  abusiness  loss and, therefore, allowable as a  deduction  incomputing   the	 profits  of  the  assessee's  business	  issustainable under law?"Both  these  questions	were  answered	in  favour  of	 therespondent and against the appellant.Counsel for the Commissioner challenged the findings of	 theTribunal  in regard to the existence of commercial  practicein Bombay but this ground of attack is not available to	 himbecause	 not only did the Tribunal give this finding in	 itsOrder,	but  in the agreed statement of the case  also	thisfinding	 was  repeated	as is shown by	the  passage  quotedabove.	 The High Court also has proceeded on the  basis  ofthis commercial practice.  In the judgment under appeal	 thelearned Chief Justice said:647"The finding of the Tribunal is clear and explicit that whatthe  assessee  was  doing  was	not  something	out  of	 theordinary,  but in borrowing this money on joint and  severalliability he was following a practice which was	 establishedas  a commercial practice.  Therefore, the  transaction	 wasclearly in the course of the business and incidental to	 thebusiness and it is this transaction which resulted in a lossto  the	 assesses,  he having to pay the  liability  of	 thesurety."Therefore this appeal has to be decided on the basis that  acommercial practice of financing business by borrowing moneyon joint and several liability was established.It was argued on behalf of the appellant that this court  inMadan Gopal Bagla v. Commissioner of Income Tax, West Bengal(1)  had  decided against the allowability of  such  losses.But  the facts of that case when carefully  scrutinised	 aredistinguishable	 and  the  decision  does  not	support	 thecontentions of the appellant.  No doubt certain features  ofthat case and the present one are similar but they differ inessential features.  In that case the assessee was a  timbermerchant  who obtained a loan of Rs. 1 lac from the Bank  ofIndia on the joint security of himself and one Mamraj, whichthe  assessee paid off.	 Mamraj also obtained a loan of	 Rs.I  lac	on the joint security of himself and  the  assessee.Mamraj	became an insolvent and the assessee had to pay	 thewhole  of  the amount borrowed with interest  thereon.	 Theassessee there received a certain amount of money by way  ofdividends from the Receiver and the balance he wrote off  asbad  debt  in  the  assessment year and	 claimed  it  as  anallowable deduction under s. 10.  The High Court there	heldthat  the debt could not be said to be a debt in respect  ofthe  business of the assessee as he was not carrying on	 thebusiness  of standing surety for other persons nor was he  amoney-lender, he being simply a timber merchant; that it hadnot  been established nor was it alleged that he was in	 thehabit of standing surety for other persons "along with	themfor  purposes of securing loans for their use  and  benefit"and even if money(1)  [1956] S.C.R. 551.648had  been  so borrowed and there had been a  loss  the	losswould  have been a capital loss and not a business  loss  tothe  assessee.	 This statement of the law was	approved  bythis  Court but there mutuality, as an essential  ingredientof the custom established, was found to	   be lacking as  isshown  by  the following passage from  the judgment  of	 thecourt."The   custom	stated	before	 the   Appellate   AssistantCommissioner was that persons carrying on business in Bombayused  to borrow monies on joint security from the  Banks  inorder  to facilitate getting financial assistance  from	 theBanks	and  that  too	at  lower  rates  of  interest.	   Abusinessman  could  procure financial  assistance  from	 theBanks  on his own, but he would in that case have to  pay  ahigher rate of interest.  He would have to pay a lower	rateof interest if he could procure as surety another  business-man, who would be approved by the Bank.	 This, however,	 didnot  mean  that	 mutual	 accommodation	by  businessmen	 wasnecessarily  an	 ingredient part of that  custom.   A  couldprocure B, C or D to join him as surety in order to  achievethis objective, but it did not necessarily follow that if  Awanted	to procure B, C or D to thus join him as  surety  hecould  only do so if he in his own turn joined B, C or D  assurety in the loans which B, C or D procured in their  turnsfrom  the Banks for financing their  respective	 businesses.Unless that factor was established, the mere procurement  byA  of  B,  C  or D as surety  would  not  be  sufficient  toestablish  the	custom	sought	to be  relied  upon  by	 theappellant so as to make the transaction of his having joinedMumraj	Rambhagat as surety in the loan procured  by  MumrajRambhagat from Imperial Bank of India, a transaction in	 thecourse	of carrying on his own timber business and  to	makethe loss in the transaction a trading loss or a bad debt  ofthe timber business of the appellant."Continuing at page 558 it was observed:"There	were  thus elements of mutuality and  the  essentialingredient in the carrying on of the money lending business,which were elements of the custom649proved in that case, both of which are wanting in thepresent case before us."Mr. Palkhivala for the respondent rightly argued that  MadanGopal  Bagla's	case (1) was decided  against  the  assesseebecause the custom of persons standing surety for each otherfor  borrowing money and the element of mutuality which	 wasan  essential  ingredient  in the case	of  Commissioner  ofIncome	Tax, Madras v. S. A. S. Ramaswamy Chettiar  (2)	 wasnot  proved.   In the latter case it  was  established	thatthere  was  a well recognised custom  amongst  Chettiars  ofraising	 funds	for their business of money lenders  by	 theexecution of joint pronotes and that if a loss was sustainedby one of the executants having to pay the whole on  accountof inability of the other it was a deductible loss.The  appellant also relied on a judgment of the Madras	HighCourt  in  Commissioner of Income Tax v.  S.  R.  SubramanyaPillai (3).  In that case the assessee was a book-seller whofrom time to time jointly with another person borrowed moneyout of which he employed a portion in his business.  One  ofsuch  amounts  borrowed	 was Rs. 16,200	 out  of  which	 theassessee  took	Rs. 10,450 for his business  needs  and	 theother debtor took the balance.	The latter became  insolventand the assessee had to pay the whole of the money  borrowedand claimed it as allowable deduction under s. 10(2)(xi)  ors. 10(2)(xv) of the Act or as business loss and it was	holdthat he was not entitled, because the loss sustained by	 theassessee  was too remote from the business  of	book-sellingcarried	 on by him and was not sufficiently  connected	withthe  trade  and therefore fell outside the  range  of  thoseamounts which could properly be brought into profit and lossaccount	 of the business.  The decision in  Commissioner  ofIncome	Tax  v. S. A. S. Ramaswamy Chettiar  (2)  was  theredistinguished  on  the	ground that  the  decision  must  beconfined  to  its own peculiar facts and did  not  apply  tobusiness  as the one in Subramanya Pillai's Case  (3).	 Thefollowing passage from(1) (1956) S.C.R, 551,	     (2) (1946) 14 I.T.R. 236.(3) [1950] 18 I.T.R. 85.650the  judgment  of  Viswanatha Sastri, J., in  that  case  isrelevant:-"But  there  the business was one of money lending  and	 theCourt  found  that  according to  the  wellknown  and  well-recognised  mercantile custom of Nattukottai  bankers,	theywere in the habit of raising 'funds which formed the  stock-in-trade of their money lending business by the execution ofjoint  promissory  notes  in favour of	bankers.   That	 wasapparently  the usual technique of obtaining credit  adoptedby  the Nattukottai Chetti community money-lenders.  In	 thecontext	 this  Court held that where  a	 Nattukottai  Chettimoney-lender  paid off in their entirety the  debts  jointlydue by him and another as a result of the latter's inabilityto  pay, the loss sustained as a result of this	 transactionwas a loss of the moneylending business itself and thereforea deductible item in computing profits."In the instant case it has been found that there was a	wellrecognised  commercial	practice in Bombay  of	carrying  onbusiness by borrowing money from Banks on joint and  severalliability.  It was also found that by so doing the  borrowercould  borrow  money  at a lower rate of  interest  than  heotherwise  would  have	paid; that the	respondent  had,  inaccordance with the commercial practice, borrowed the money,the  whole  of	which he had to	 return	 because  the  jointpromisor Kishori Lal had become bankrupt; mutuality was alsoheld  proved.  It cannot be said that the essential  featureof  the	 case now before us is in principle  different	fromthat of the Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ramaswamy Chettiar(1).   In both cases the finding is that there is  mutualityand  custom  of borrowing money on joint  pronotes  for	 thecarrying   on	of  business.	In  our	  opinion   in	 thecircumstances  proved in the present case, and on the  factsestablished  and on the findings given, the  respondent	 wasrightly	 held  to be entitled to deduct the loss  which	 wassuffered by him in the transaction in dispute.Counsel for the assessee drew our attention to a(1)  (1946) 14 I.T.R. 236.651Privy  Council judgment Montreal Coke and Manufacturing	 Co.v. Minister of National Revenue (1) but that, case can	haveno  application to the facts of the present case because  itwas  found  there as a fact that the  assessees's  financialarrangements  were  quite distinct from	 the  activities  bywhich  they earned their income and expenditure incurred  inrelation  to  the  financing'  of  their  business  was	 notexpenditure  in	 the  earning of  their	 income	 within	 thestatute.It was then contended that the loss of the respondent was  a0capital loss and for this again reliance was placed on	 thejudgment of this Court in Madan Gopal Bagla's case (2 )	 andparticularly on the observation at page 559 where  Bhagwati,J., quoted with approval the observations of the High  Courtin the judgment but as we have pointed out the facts of thatcase  are  distinguishable and what was said  there  has  noapplication  to	 the facts and circumstances proved  in	 thepresent case.In  our view the judgment of the High Court is right and  wetherefore dismiss this appeal with costs.				Appeal dismissed.
