The Indian Income-tax Act came into force in thatarea  in  April 1, 1950, and on December  26,  1950,  noticeunder s. 22(2) of that Act was served upon the appellants tosubmit	their  return for the assessment year  1950-51.	  OnSeptember  8,  1952, the appellants submitted  their  returnstating	 that they had no assessable income for	 that  year.The  Income Tax Officer passed on that return an order,	 "noproceeding", and closed the assessment.	 When the appellantssubmitted  their return for the next assessment year,  theirbooks of account disclosed an opening cash credit balance ofRs.  1,87,000  and  odd on July 1.  1949.   They  failed  toproduce the books of account of the previous years, and	 theIncome-tax  Officer held that Rs. 1,37,000 out of  the	saidopening	 balance  represented  income  from  an	 undisclosedsource.	  The  appellants submitted a fresh return  for	 theassessment  year 1950-51 purporting to do so under s.  22(3)of  the Indian Incometax Act.  Pursuant to the direction  ofthe Appellate Assistant Commissioner, the Income Tax Officeron October 15, 1957, served on the appellants a notice unders. 34 of the Act and thereupon the appellants moved the HighCourt  under Art. 226 for an order quashing the said  noticeand the proceeding as without jurisdiction.  The High  Courtdismissed the petition.Held,  that it was not correct to say that the issue of	 thenotice	for  reassessment was without  jurisdiction  as	 theassessment was yet pending.Under  S. 23(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, it is open  tothe Income-tax Officer, if he is satisfied as to correctnessof  the return filed by the assessee, to assess	 the  incomeand  determine	the sum payable on the basis of	 the  returnwithout	 requiring the assessee either to be present  or  toProduce evidence.  The order 'no proceeding recorded on the.return must, therefore, mean that the Income Tax Officer badaccepted the previous return and assessed the income as nil.A revised return under s. 22(3) filed by the assessee may be912entertained  only  before the order of	assessment  and	 notthereafter.   Lodging of such a return after the  assessmentis no bar  to reassessment under s. 34(1) of the Act.It could not be said, having regard to the provisions of  s.13(1) of the Finance Act (XXV of 1950) and cl. 5(1) of Part.B  States (Taxation Concessions) Order 1950, issued  by	 theCentral	 Government  under s. 60A of the  Indian  Income-taxAct,  that  for the assessment year 1950-51  the  appellantswere  assessable  under the Mysore Income-tax  Act  and	 notunder the Indian Income-tax Act.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 200 of 1960.Appeal	from  the Judgment and Order dated the	19th  March,1959, of the Mysore High Court, Bangalore, in Writ  PetitionNo. 263 of 1957.K.Srinivasan and R. Gopalakrishnan, for the appellant.A. N. Kirpal and D. Gupta, for the respondent.1960.	December 5. The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySHAH, J.-This appeal with certificate of fitness granted  bythe  High  Court of Judicature of Mysore is  from  an  orderrejecting the petition of the appellant for a writ to  quasha notice of reassessment under s.  34  of the Indian  IncomeTax Act.The  appellants	 are a Hindu Undivided	Family	carrying  onbusiness in groundnuts and other commodities at	 Goribidnur,Kolar  District, in the territory which formed part  of	 theformer	State  of  Mysore.  The Mysore Income  Tax  Act	 wasrepealed  and  the Indian' Income Tax Act was  brought	intoforce  in the Part-B State of Mysore as from April 1,  1950.The appellants had adopted as their year of; account July  1to  June  30 of the succeeding year and they  were  assessedunder the Mysore Income Tax Act on that footing for the yearof  assessment 1949-50 corresponding to the year of  accountJuly 1, 1948,to June 30, 1949.	After the Indian Income	 TaxAct was applied to the State of Mysore on December 26, 1950,notice	under  s.  22(2) of the Indian Income  Tax  Act	 wasserved upon the appellants requiring them to submit their913return	of  income  for the  assessment	 year  1950-51.	  OnSeptember  8,  1952, the appellants submitted  their  returnstating	  that	 for  the  year	 ending	  June	 30,   1949,corresponding  to  the assessment year	1949-50,  they	wereassessed under the Mysore Income Tax Act, that their  incomefor the year ending June 30, 1950, was assessable under	 theIndian	Income	Tax Act in the assessment year	1951-52	 andthat  they had no assessable income for the assessment	year1950-51.   The Income Tax Officer passed on that  return  anorder  "no proceeding" and closed the assessment.   For	 theassessment  year  1951-52, the	appellants  submitted  theirreturn	of income.  In the books of account produced by	 theappellants  an opening cash credit balance of  Rs.  1,87,000odd on July 1, 1949, was disclosed.  The Income Tax  Officercalled upon the appellants to produce their books of accountof  previous years, but the books were not produced  on	 theplea  that the same were lost.	In assessing the  income  ofthe  appellants for the year of account 1949-50, the  IncomeTax  Officer  held  that Rs. 1,37,000  out  of	the  openingbalance	 in  the  books	 of  account  dated  July  1,  1949,represented  income from an undisclosed source.	 In  appeal,the  Appellate	Assistant  Commissioner	 observed  that	 theappellants not having exercised their option under s.  2(ii)of  the	 Indian Income Tax Act, and in the absence  "of	 anysystem of accounting adopted" by them, the only course	opento  the	 Income Tax Officer was to take the  financial	yearending	March 31, 1950, as the previous year for the  incomefrom  an  undisclosed source, and directed  the	 Income	 TaxOfficer	 to consider this credit in the assessment  for	 theyear  1950-51 after giving opportunity to the appellants  toexplain	 the nature and source thereof.	 Before	 the  appealwas disposed of by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, theappellants  had submitted a fresh return for the  assessmentyear 195051 purporting to do so under s. 22(3) of the IndianIncome Tax Act.	 Pursuant to the direction of the  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner,  the Income Tax  Officer  issued  anotice of reassessment under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act andserved it on October 15, 1957,914calling	 upon the appellants to submit a fresh return.	 Theappellants thereupon submitted a petition under Art. 226  ofthe Constitution to the High Court of Mysore praying for  anorder  declaring  that the notice under s.  34	was  withoutjurisdiction  and  for quashing the  notice  and  proceedingconsequent thereon.  This petition was dismissed by the HighCourt,	but  the  High	Court, on  the	application  of	 theappellants,  certified	that the appeal was a  fit  one	 forappeal to this court.Section	 34(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act at the  relevanttime in so far as it is material provided:"(1) If-(a)..the  Income Tax Officer has reason to believe  that  byreason	of  the	 omission  or failure on  the  part  of	 theassessee to make a return of his income under s. 22 for	 anyyear  or  to  disclose fully and truly	all  material  factsnecessary for his assessment for that year, income,  profitsor gains chargeable to incometax have escaped assessment forthat year, or(b)..notwithstanding  that  there has been  no	omission  orfailure	 as  mentioned	in clause (a) on  the  part  of	 theassessee,  the	Income	Tax Officer has	 in  consequence  ofinformation in his possession reason to believe that income,profits	 or  gains  chargeable to  income-tax  have  escapedassessment  for any year, he may in cases falling under	 el.(a) at any time within eight years and in cases falling	 cl.(b) within four years of the end of that year, serve on	 theassessee a notice containing all or any of the	requirementswhich may be included in a notice under sub-s. (2) of s.  22and  may proceed to assess or reassess such income,  profitsor  gains; and the provisions of this Act shall, so  far  asmay  be,  apply accordingly as if the notice were  a  noticeissued under that sub-section."In the course of the assessment proceedings for 1951-52, theappellants  produced  their books of account  containing  anentry dated July 1, 1949, showing an opening cash balance ofRs.  1,87,000  odd which was not  satisfactorily  explained.Though	called	upon, they did not produce  their  books  ofaccount for the earlier year.  The appellants had failed  todisclose in their return for the assessment year 1950-51 any915income.	  In the circumstances, the Income Tax	Officer	 hadreason	to believe that by reason of failure on the part  ofthe  appellants	 to disclose fully and truly  all'  materialfacts  necessary  for  assessment  for	that  year,   incomechargeable  to tax had escaped assessment.  The	 Income	 TaxOfficer	 had therefore jurisdiction to issue the notice	 forreassessment.The  submission	 that  the  previous  return  submitted	  onSeptember 8, 1952, "had not been disposed of" and until	 theassessment pursuant to that return was made, no notice unders.  34(1)  for	reassessment could be  issued,	has  in	 ourjudgment no substance.	The Income Tax Officer had  disposedof  the assessment proceeding accepting the submission	madeby the appellants that they had no income for the assessmentyear 1950-51.  Under s. 23(1) of the Indian Income Tax	Act,it  is	open to the Income Tax Officer, if he  is  satisfiedthat the return made by an assessee under s. 22 is  correct,to assess the income and to determine the sum payable by theassessee  on the basis of the return without  requiring	 thepresence  of  the  assessee  or production  by	him  of	 anyevidence.    The  appellants  had  in  their  return   datedSeptember  8,  1952, submitted that they had  no  assessableincome	for  the year in question and on  this	return,	 theIncome	Tax Officer had passed the order  "no,	proceeding".Such  an order in the circumstances of the case	 meant	thatthe Income Tax Officer accepted the return and assessed	 theincome as "nil".  If thereafter, the Income Tax Officer	 hadreason to believe that the appellants had failed to disclosefully and truly all material facts necessary for  assessmentfor  that  year, it was open to him to issue  a	 notice	 forreassessment.Under  s. 22, sub-s. (3), an assessee may submit  a  revisedreturn if after he has furnished the return under sub-s. (2)he  discovers any omission or wrong statement therein.	 Butsuch a revised return can only be filed "at any time  beforethe  assessment	 is made" and not  thereafter.	 The  returndated February 26, 1957, was submitted after the  assessmentwas made pursuant to the earlier return and it could not  beentertained.  Nor could the lodging of such a return916debar  the Income Tax Officer from commencing  a  proceedingfor reassessment of the appellant under s.   34(1)  of	 theIndian Income Tax Act.There  is also no substance in the contention that  for	 theassessment year 1950-51 the assessee could be assessed underthe  Mysore Income Tax Act and not under the  Indian  IncomeTax Act.  By the Finance Act XXV of 1950 s. 13, cl. (1),  itwas provided in so far as it is material that:"If immediately before the 1st day of April, 1950, there  isin  force  in  any Part-B State...... any  law	relating  toincome-tax or super-tax or tax on profits of business,	thatlaw  shall cease to have effect except for the	purposes  ofthe levy, assessment and collection of income-tax and super-tax  in respect of any period not included in  the  previousyear for the purposes of assessment under the Indian  IncomeTax Act, 1922 (XI of 1922), for the year ending on the	31stday of March, 1951, or for any subsequent year."By  virtue of s. 13(1), the Mysore Income Tax Act ceased  tobe  in	operation  as from April 1,  1950,  except  for	 thepurposes  of levy, assessment and collection  of  income-taxand  super  tax	 in  respect of any  period  which  was	 notincluded in the previous year for the purposes of assessmentunder  the  Indian Income Tax Act for  the  assessment	year1950-51.   The appellants had been assessed for	 the  periodJuly 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949, under the Mysore Income	 TaxAct.  It is manifest that for any account year which was theprevious year in relation to the assessment year 195051, theappellants  were  liable  to be assessed  under	 the  IndianIncome Tax Act and not under the repealed Act.	The year  ofaccount	 July  1, 1949, to June 30, 1950, was not  a  periodprior  to such previous year and therefore liability to	 paytax  in respect of that period could be assessed  not  underthe  Mysore Income Tax Act, but under the Indian Income	 TaxAct.   It was urged that this interpretation of s.  13	may,when the account year of an assessee does not coincide	withthe financial year lead to double taxation of the income forthe account year ending between April 1, 1949,917and  March 31, 1950.  But in order to avoid the	 contingencyenvisaged by the appellants, the Central Government has,  inexercise of its power under s. 60A of the Indian Income	 TaxAct, issued the Part-B States (Taxation Concessions)  Order,1950, which by cl. 5(1) provides amongst other things,	thatthe  income, profits and gains of any previous	year  endingafter the 31st day of March, 1949, which is a previous	yearfor  the  State assessment year 1949-50	 shall	be  assessedunder  the  Act (Indian Income Tax Act, 1922) for  the	yearending on the 31st March, 1951, if and only if such  income,profits	 and gains have not, before the appointed day,	beenassessed  under	 the  State  law.  If,	in  respect  of	 theprevious year for the purposes of the assessment year ending31st  March, 1951, the appellants had been assessed  by	 anyState Government under a law relating to income-tax in forcein the State, the Indian Income Tax authorities would be in-competent to assess income for that year; but in default  ofsuch  assessment income of the appellants for that year	 wasassessable under the Indian Income Tax Act.The notice under s. 34 was also not issued after the  expiryof  the	 period prescribed in that behalf.  The	 notice	 wasissued	by the Income Tax Officer because he had  reason  tobelieve	 that  by  reason  of failure on  the  part  of	 theappellants  to disclose fully and truly all  material  factsnecessary  for	the  assessment for the	 the  year  1950-51,income	 had  escaped  assessment.   Such  a   notice	fellmanifestly  within  s. 34(1)(a) and could be  issued  withineight  years, from the end of the year of  assessment.	 Theimpugned  notice under s. 34 for reassessment of the  incomeof the appellants for the year 1950-51 was, in our judgment,properly  issued and the High Court was right in  dismissingthe petition for a writ to quash the notice.The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.116918
