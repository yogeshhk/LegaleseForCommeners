A  complaintwas  received by the Superintendent of Police that the	com-plainant was carrying currency notes of Rs. 650 in a  bundlewhen  he  was stopped by the respondent and his	 person	 wassearched, that the respondent opened the bundle of notes andhanded over the notes one by one to one Lalji, who was	withhim and that Lalji returned the notes to him but on reachinghome he found the notes short by Rs. 250.  Proceedings unders. 7 of the Police Act were taken against the respondent  onthe  charge  of	 misappropriation  of Rs.  250	and  he	 wasdismissed  from service by an order of the Deputy  InspectorGeneral	 of  Police.  The respondent filed a  writ  petitionbefore the High Court challenging the order of the dismissalon the ground that the authorities had acted in violation ofRule  I of Para. 486 of the U. P. Police  Regulation.	Thisrule required that every information received by the  policerelating  to  the commission of a cognizable  offence  by  aPolice Officer shall be dealt with in the first place  underCh.   XIV, Code of Criminal Procedure.	The High Court	heldthat  the provisions of para. 486 of the Police	 Regulationshad  not been observed and that the proceedings taken  underS.  7  of  the	Police Act  were  invalid  and	illegal	 andaccordingly  quashed the order of dismissal.  The  appellantcontended  (i)	that  the complaint did	 not  make  out	 anycognizable offence against the respondent and r. I of  Para.486  was  not applicable in this case, (ii) that r.  III  ofPara.  486 enabled the authorities to initiate	departmentalproceedings  without complying with the provisions of r.  I,(iii)  that the Police Regulations made in exercise  of	 thepower  conferred  on  the Government under  the	 Police	 Actdelegating the power of the Governor to dismiss at  pleasureto a subordinate officer were only administrative directionsfor the exercise of the pleasure in a reasonable manner	 andany  breach of the regulations did not confer any  right  orgive a cause of action to the public servant, and (iv)	thatthe  regulations were only directory and the  non-compliancewith the rules did not invalidate the order of dismissal.680Held,  (per Sarkar, Subba Rao and Mudholkar, JJ.)  that	 theorder  of  dismissal  was illegal as it was  based  upon  anenquiry	 held in violation of r. I of Para 486 of the PoliceRegulations.The  facts  alleged in the complaint made out  a  cognizableoffence	  under	 s.  405  Indian  Penal	 Code  against	 therespondent,  and the provisions of r. I of Para .  486	wereapplicable  to	it.  A Police Officer making a search  of  aperson	was  'entrusted' with the money handed over  by	 theperson searched.Rule III of Para. 486 did not deal with cognizable offences,it  dealt with offences falling only under s. 7	 Police	 Actand to non-cognizable offences.	 Rule III did not provide analternative procedure to that prescribed under r. I.The  position with regard to the tenure of  public  servantsand to the taking of disciplinary action against them  underthe present Constitution was as follows:(i)  Every  person  who was a member  of  a  public  servicedescribed in Art. 310 of the Constitution held office duringthe pleasure of the President or the Governor.(ii)  The power to dismiss a public servant at pleasure	 wasoutside the scope of Art.  I54 and, therefore, could not  bedelegated  by  the Governor to a  subordinate  officer,	 andcould  be exercised by him only in the manner prescribed  bythe Constitution.(iii) This tenure was subject to the limitations or qualifi-cations mentioned in Art. 311.(iv )Parliament or the Legislature of States could not	makea  law abrogating or modifying this tenure so as to  impingeupon  the overriding power conferred upon the  President  orthe Governor under Art. 310, as qualified by Art. 311.(v)  Parliament or the Legislatures of States could  make  alaw  regulating the conditions of service of such  a  memberwhich  included proceedings by way of  disciplinary  action,without	 affecting  the	 powers	 of  the  President  or	 theGovernor under Art. 310 read with Art. 311.(vi) Parliament	 and the Legislatures also could  makea	 lawlaying	down  and regulating the scope and  content  of	 thedoctrine  of "reasonable opportunity" embodied in  Art.	 311but the said law was subject to judicial review.(vii) If a statute could be made by Legislatures within	 theforegoing permissible limits, the rules made by an authorityin exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewisebe efficacious within the said limits.N.

The Union of India,  [1958]  S.C.R.1080, referred to.Per  Gajendragadkar and Wanchoo, JJ.-The provisions of	para486 were merely directory and a non-compliance therewith didnot  invalidate	 the disciplinary action taken	against	 therespondent.All public servants, other than those excepted expressly  bythe  Constitution,  held office during the pleasure  of	 thePresident  or the Governor, and no law or rule framed  underArt.  300 or Art.  I54(2)(b) could cut down the	 content  ofthe  pleasure tenure in Art. 310 subject to Art.  31i.	 ThePolice	Act could not stand higher than a law  passed  underArt.  309  or  Art. 154(2)(b) and could	 not  cut  down	 thecontent of the pleasure tenure in Art. 310682The  Police officers held office during the pleasure of	 theGovernor  and the only protection they could claim  was	 thetwo  guarantees contained in Art. 311.The  rules  framed  under s. 7 Police Act would	 be  of	 twokinds,	namely (1) those which defined the  jurisdiction  ofthe  four  grades of officers specified in s. 7	 to  inflictparticular kind of punishment on particular police  officersof  the subordinate ranks-such rules would be mandatory	 butthey  could not go against the provisions of Art.  311,	 and(2) procedural rules.  The procedural rules could be of	 twokinds:	(i)  those that prescribed the manner in  which	 theguarantee  contained in Art. 311(2) May be carried  out-suchrules  would be mandatory, and (ii) other merely  proceduralrules-they could only be directory.The power of the Governor to dismiss was executive power  ofthe  State and could be exercised under Art. 154(i)  by	 theGovernor  himself  directly or indirectly  through  officerssubordinate to him.The  officers  specified  in s. 7 of  the  Police  Act	wereexercising the powers of the Governor to dismiss at pleasureand  their  powers were subject to the same  limitations  towhich  the Governor was subject.  Whether it was  delegationby the Governor himself or whether it was delegation by	 lawunder  Art. 154(2)(b) or by the existing law, which must  betreated	 as  analogous to a law under  Art.  154(2)(b),	 theofficer	  exercising  the  power  of  dismissal	  was	onlyindirectly  exercising	the Governor's power to	 dismiss  atpleasure.   His	 order also was subject to the	two  fettersunder  Art.  311  and could not be  subjected  to  any	morefetters	 by  procedural rules other than  those	 framed	 forcarrying out the objects of Art. 311(2).R.   Venkata Rao v. Secretary of State for India in Council,[1936] 64 I.A. 55, referred to.Paragraph 486 was not meant for the purpose of carrying	 outthe  object  of Art. 311(2) and could not be  mandatory	 andcould not add a further fetter on the exercise of the  powerto  dismiss at the pleasure of the Governor over  and  abovethe fetters contained in Art. 311.  This rule was only meantto  gather materials for the satisfaction of  the  authorityconcerned, whether to take action or not.  As such para	 486was  merely  directory	and a failure  to  comply  therewithstrictly  or  otherwise	 did not  vitiate  the	disciplinaryaction.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 119 of 1959.Appeal	by special leave from the judgment and	order  datedJanuary	 9,  1958,  of the  Allahabad  High  Court  (LucknowBench),	 Lucknow,  in Civil Misc.  Application	No.  115  of1955.683C. B. Agarwala and C. P. Lal, for the appellants.G. S. Pathak, Achru Ram, S. N. Andley, RameshwarNath, J. B. Dadachanji and P. L. Vohra for the respondent.1960.  November, 25.  The Judgment of Sarkar, Subba Rao	 andMudholkar, JJ., was delivered by Subba Rao, J., and that  ofGajendragadkar	and Wanchoo, JJ., was delivered by  Wanchoo,J.SUBBA RAO, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against thejudgment  of  the  High Court of  Judicature  at  Allahabad,Lucknow Bench, allowing the petition filed by the respondentunder Art. 226 of the Constitution.The  respondent was appointed a Sub-Inspector of  Police  inDecember, 1948, and was posted at Sitapur in June, 1953.  OnSeptember 6, 1953, the respondent went to village  Madhwapurin connection with an investigation of a case of theft.	  Onthe  evening  of  the  said  date  when	 he  was  returning,accompanied by one Lalji, an ex-patwari of Mohiuddinpur,  hesaw  one Tika Ram coming from the side of a canal and  goinghurriedly  towards  a field.  As the movements of  Tika	 Ramappeared  to be suspicious and as he was carrying  somethingin  the folds of his dhoti, the respondent searched him	 andfound  a bundle containing currency notes.   The  respondentcounted the currency notes and handed them over to Lalji forbeing  returned to Tika Ram, who subsequently got  them	 andwent  his  way.	  Subsequently when  Tika  Ram	counted	 thecurrency  notes at his house, he found that they were  shortby  Rs. 250.  Tika Ram's case is that the bundle when  takenby  the respondent contained notes of the value of Rs.	650,but when he counted them in his house they were only of	 thevalue  of  Rs. 400.  On September 9, 1953 Tika Ram  filed  acomplaint  to the Superintendent of Police, Sitapur, to	 theeffect that the respondent and one Lalji had misappropriateda  sum	of  its. 250.  There is dispute	 in  regard  to	 theinterpretation	of  the complaint.  On receipt of  the	saidcomplaint, the Superintendent of Police made enquiries684and  issued a notice to the respondent to show cause	 whyhis  integrity	certificate should not	be  withheld,	uponwhich the respondent submitted his explanation on October 3,1953.  Thereafter the Superintendent of Police forwarded thefile of the case to the Deputy Inspector General of  Police,Central	 Range,	 U. P., who directed the  Superintendent  ofPolice	to  take proceedings under s. 7 of  the	 Police	 Actagainst	 the respondent.  The departmental proceedings	werestarted	 against  the  respondent; on November	2,  1953,  acharge-sheet  was served upon the respondent under s.  7  ofthe  Police  Act stating that there were strong	 reasons  tosuspect that the respondent misappropriated a sum of Rs. 250from  the  purse  of  Tika Ram;	 the  respondent  filed	 hisexplanation  to the charge made against him; and  ultimatelythe  Superintendent of Police held an enquiry and  found  onthe  evidence that the respondent was guilty of the  offencewith which he was charged.  On January 2, 1954, the Superin-tendent of Police issued another notice to the respondent toshow cause why he should not be reduced to the lowest  gradeof Sub-Inspector for a period of three years.  In due coursethe  respondent showed cause against the action proposed  tobe  taken  against  him	 on a  consideration  of  which	 theSuperintendent	of  Police,  Sitapur,  by  his	order  datedJanuary 16, 1954 reduced the respondent to the lowest  gradeof  Sub-Inspector  for a period of three years.	  When	thisorder  came  to	 the notice of the D. 1. G.,  U.  P.,  on  aconsideration  of  the entire record, he came  to  the	con-clusion that the respondent-should be dismissed from serviceand on October 19, 1954 he made an order to that effect.  OnFebruary 28, 1955 the Inspector General of Police  confirmedthat order; and the revision filed by the respondent againstthat  order  to the State Government was also  dismissed  inAugust	1955.	Thereafter the respondent filed	 a  petitionunder Art. 226 of the Constitution before the High Court  ofJudicature  at	Allahabad, Lucknow Bench, for  quashing	 thesaid  orders  and  the same was heard by  a  division  benchconsisting  of Randhir Singh and Bhargava, JJ.	The  learnedjudges held that the provisions of para.685486  of	 the Police Regulations had not been  observed	and,therefore,  the proceedings taken under s. 7 of	 the  PoliceAct were invalid and illegal.  On that finding, they quashedthe  impugned  orders;	with  the  result  that	 the   orderdismissing  the respondent from service was set aside.	 TheState  Government, the Deputy Inspector General	 of  Police,Lucknow, and the Inspector General of Police, Uttar Pradesh,Lucknow, have preferred the present appeal against the	saidorder of the High Court.We  shall  now proceed to consider the	various	 contentionsraised by learned counsel in the order they were raised	 andargued before us.At  the outset Mr. C. B. Agarwala, learned counsel  for	 theappellants,  contended	that  there was	 no  breach  of	 theprovisions of para. 486 of the Police Regulations.  If	thiscontention  be accepted, no other question arises  'in	thiscase; therefore, we shall deal with the same.The  material  part of para. 486 of the	 Police	 Regulationsreads thus:"When  the offence alleged against a police officer  amountsto an offence only under section 7 of the Police Act,  therecan  be no magisterial inquiry under the Criminal  ProcedureCode.  In such cases, and in other cases until and unless  amagisterial  inquiry is ordered, inquiry will be made  underthe direction of the Superintendent of Police in  accordancewith the following rules:I.Every	 information received by the police relating to	 thecommission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shallbe dealt with in the first place under Chapter XIV, CriminalProcedure   Code,  according  to  law,	a  case	 under	 theappropriate  section being registered in the police  stationconcerned.................  This  provision  expressly	laysdown that every information received by the police  relatingto  the	 commission  of a cognizable  offence  by  a  policeofficer	 shall	be dealt with in the first place  under	 Ch.XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code.  This provision will notapply if the information received by the police does not87686relate	to the commission of a cognizable offence.   Learnedcounsel	 contends  that	 the  information  received  in	 thepresent case does not relate to any offence committed by therespondent,  much less to a cognizable offence.	 This  is  apoint  raised before us for the first time.  This  does	 notfind  a	 place even in the statement of case  filed  by	 theappellants.  In the High Court it was not contended that theinformation  did not disclose any offence committed  by	 therespondent.  Indeed, it was common case that the informationdisclosed an offence committed by the respondent, but it hadbeen  contended by the appellants that the  misappropriationof the part of the money amounted to an offence under s. 403of the Indian Penal Code, which is not a cognizable offence;and  it	 was  argued on behalf of  the	respondent  that  itamounted  to  an offence under s. 409 of  the  Indian  PenalCode.	The  learned judges accepted the contention  of	 therespondent.   Even so, it is said that whatever	 might	beenthe  contentions  of the parties, the information  given  byTika  Ram to the Superintendent of Police clearly  disclosedthat  no offence was alleged to have been committed  by	 therespondent   and  that	this  Court  would,  therefore,	  bejustified,  even  at  this very late stage,  to	 accept	 thecontention of the appellants.  But the contents of the	saidinformation  do	 not  in  any  way  support  the  assertion.Paragraph  3  of the application given by Tika	Ram  to	 theSuperintendent of Police, Sitapur, reads thus:"That on Sunday last dated 6th September, 1953 the applicanthad  with him the currency notes of Rs. 650.   The  oppositeparty as well as Shri Babu Ram met the applicant on the westof  Rampur near the Canal.  The opposite-party said  to	 theSub-Inspector  "This man appears to be clad in rags  but  ispossessed  of  considerable money." After  saying  this	 theperson	of the applicant was searched.	 The  Sub-Inspector,having	opened the bundle of notes, handed over the  (notes)one  by one to the opposite party." This  statement  clearlyindicates that either the Sub-.	 Inspector or both the	Sub-Inspector  and Lalji searched the person of Tika  Ram,	thatthe Sub-Inspector took687the bundle of notes and handed the same over, one by one, toLalji  for being returned to the applicant, and that out  ofRs. 650 a sum of Rs. 250 was not returned to him.  The factsalleged	 make out an offence against both the  Sub-Inspectoras well as Lalji.  The mere fact that the respondent is	 notshown as one of the opposite parties in the application doesnot  affect the question, for the information given  in	 theapplication imputed the commission of an offence to both therespondent  and	 Lalji.	  The notice  issued  by  the  Supe-rintendent  of Police on November 2, 1953 to the  respondentalso charges him with an offence of misappropriation.  It isstated	 that	the   said  notice  only   says	  that	 theSuperintendent	of Police had good reasons to  suspect	thatthe respondent misappropriated the sum of money and that  itdoes   not   aver   that  he  committed	  the	offence	  ofmisappropriation.    But   what	  matters   is	 'that	 theSuperintendent	 of   Police  also   understood	  from	 theinformation given and the enquiry conducted by him that	 therespondent  had committed the offence.	Reliance  is  placedupon paragraph 3 of the writ petition wherein the respondentherein stated that Tika Ram filed a complaint against  Laljiand  not against the respondent.  As a fact that is  correctin  the	 sense	that the respondent was not  shown  in	thatapplication  as	 the opposite -party though in the  body  ofthat application definite allegations were made against	 therespondent.    In   the	 counter-affidavit  filed   by	 theSuperintendent	of  Police  on behalf of the  State  it	 wasclearly averred that on September 9, 1953 Tika Ram  appearedbefore him and filed a petition to the effect fiat one Laljiand  the  respondent had misappropriated a sum of  Rs.	250.Whatever ambiguity there might have been in the	 information-we do not find any-this allegation dispels it and it is notopen  to  the appellants at this stage to contend  that	 thepetition   did	 not  disclose	any  offence   against	 therespondent.   In  the circumstances, we must hold  that	 theinformation received by the police related to the commissionof an offence by the respondent.Even  so,  it is contended that the said offence  is  not  acognizable offence.  It is said that there was no688entrustment  made by Tika Ram to the respondent	 and   that,therefore,  the	 offence did not fall under s. 409  of	 theIndian Penal Code, which is a cognizable offence,but only under s. 403 of the Indian Penal Code, which is nota cognizable offence.  Section 405 of the Indian Penal	Codedefines	 "criminal  breach  of trust"  and  s.	409  thereofprescribes  the punishment for the criminal breach of  trustby a public servant.  Under s. 405 of the Indian Penal Code,"Whoever,  being in any manner entrusted with  property,  orwith any dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriatesor  converts  to his own use that property,  or	 dishonestlyuses  or  disposes  of that property  in  violation  of	 anydirection of law prescribing the mode in which such trust isto  be	discharged,  or of any legal  contract,	 express  orimplied,  which he has made touching the discharge  of	suchtrust,	or  wilfully suffers any person so  to	do,  commits"criminal breach of trust".  To constitute an offence  underthis  section, there must be an entrustment of property	 anddishonest  misappropriation of it. The person entrusted	 maymisappropriate it himself, or he may wilfully suffer anotherperson to do so.  In the instant case the respondent,  beinga  police officer, was legally entitled to search  a  personfound  under  suspicious  circumstances;  and  Tika  Ram  inhanding over the bundle of notes to the police officer	musthave  done so in the confidence that he would get  back	 thenotes  from  him when the suspicion was cleared.   In  thesecircumstances,	there  cannot be any difficulty	 in  holdingthat  the  currency notes were alleged to have	been  handedover  by Tika Ram to the respondent for a specific  purpose,but  were dishonestly misappropriated by the  respondent  orat,  any rate he wilfully suffered Lalji  to  misappropriatethe  same.  We, therefore, hold that if the  currency  noteswere  taken by the respondent in discharge of his  duty	 forinspection  and return, he was certainly entrusted with	 thenotes within the meaning of s. 405 of the Indian Penal Code.If  so, the information discloses a cognizable offence.	  Wereject the first contention.The  second objection of learned counsel for the  appellantsis that sub-para. (3) of para. 486 of the689Police Regulations enables the appropriate police  authorityto  initiate the departmental proceeding  without  complyingwith  the  provisions of sub-para. (1) of  para.  486.	 The-relevant  portion  of para. 486 of the	 Police	 Regulationsreads:"When the offence amounts to an offence only under section 7of the Police Act, there can be no magisterial inquiry underthe  Criminal Procedure Code.  In such cases, and  in  othercases  until  and unless a magisterial inquiry	is  ordered,inquiry	  will	 be  made  under  the	direction   of	 theSuperintendent	of Police in accordance with  the  followingrules:......... "Rule  I	 relates to a cognizable offence, r. II	 to  a	non-cognizable. offence, including an offence under s. 29 of thePolice	Act,  and  r. III to an offence under s.  7  of	 thePolice Act or a non-cognizable offence, including an offenceunder s. 29 of the Police Act.	Rule III says:"When a Superintendent of Police sees reason to take  actionon  information	 given to him, or on his  own  knowledge  orsuspicion,  that  a police officer subordinate	to  him	 hascommitted an offence under section 7 of the Police Act or  anon-cognizable	offence (including an offence under  section29  of the Police Act) of which he considers it	 unnecessaryat that stage to forward a report in writing to the DistrictMagistrate under rule II above, he will make or cause to  bemade by an officer senior in rank to the officer charged,  adepartmental  inquiry  sufficient to test the truth  of	 thecharge.	  On the conclusion of this inquiry he	will  decidewhether further action is necessary, and if so, whether	 theofficer	 charged should be departmentally tried, or  whetherthe  District Magistrate should be moved to take  cognizanceof the case under the Criminal Procedure Code..."The argument is that the words "an offence under s. 7 of thePolice	 Act"  take  in	 a  cognizable	offence	 and   that,therefore, this rule provides for a procedure alternative tothat  prescribed  under	 r. I. We do  not  think  that	thiscontention  is sound.  Section 7 of the Police Act  empowerscertain officers to dismiss, suspend690or  reduce any police officer of the subordinate  rank	whomthey shall think remiss or negligent in the discharge of hisduty, or unfit for the same.  The grounds for punishment arecomprehensive:	they may take in offences under	 the  IndianPenal Code or other penal statutes.  The commission of	suchoffences  may  also be a ground to hold that an	 officer  isunfit  to hold his office.  Action under this  section	can,therefore,  be taken in respect of, (i) offences only  unders.  7 of the Police Act without involving any cognizable  ornoncognizable offences, that is, simple remissness or negli-gence  in the discharge of duty, (ii)  cognizable  offences,and  (iii)  non-cognizable offences.  Paragraph 486  of	 thePolice Regulations makes this clear.  It says that when	 theoffence	 alleged  against  a police officer  amounts  to  anoffence	 only under s. 7 of the Police Act, there can be  nomagisterial inquiry under the Criminal Procedure Code.	Thispart  of the rule applies to an offence only under s.  7  ofthe  Police Act i. e., the first category  mentioned  above.Rule  I	 refers to a cognizable offence i.  e.,	 the  secondcategory,  rule	 11 to a non-cognizable offence i.  e.,	 thethird category, and rule III applies to an offence under  s.7 of the Police Act and to a noncognizable offence.   Thoughthe  word "only" is not mentioned in rule 111,	the  offenceunder  s. 7 of the Police Act can, in the context,  mean  anoffence	 only  under s. 7 of the said Act i.e.,	 an  offencefalling under the first category.  So understood, the  threerules  can be reconciled.  We, therefore, hold that, as	 theoffence	 complained of in the present case is  a  cognizableoffence, it falls under rule I and not under rule 111.	 We,therefore, reject this contention.The  third  contention advanced by learned counsel  for	 theappellants  raises  a constitutional point  of	considerableimportance.  The gist of the argument may be stated thus: InEngland, the service under the Crown is held at the  Crown'spleasure, unless the employment is for good behaviour or fora cause.  But if there is a statute prescribing the terms ofservice	 and  the mode of dismissal of the  servant  of	 theCrown, the statute would control the pleasure of the  Crown.In India, the Constitution as well as the691earlier	 Constitution Acts of 1915, as amended in 1919,	 and1935  embodied the incidents of "tenure at pleasure" of	 HisMajesty,  or the President or the Governor, as the case	 maybe,  but did not empower the Legislatures under the  earlierActs  and  the	Parliament and the  Legislatures  under	 theConstitution to make a law abrogating or modifying the	saidtenure;	 therefore, any law made by appropriate	 authoritiesconferring  a power on any subordinate officer to dismiss  aservant	 must  be construed not to limit the  power  of	 HisMajesty, the President or the Governor, as the case may	 be,but only to indicate that they would express their  pleasureonly through the said officers.	 The rules made in  exerciseof  a  power conferred on a Government-under  a	 statute  sodelegating  the power to a subordinate officer can  only  beadministrative	directions  to enable the  exercise  of	 thepleasure by the concerned authorities in a reasonable mannerand  that  any breach of those regulations  cannot  possiblyconfer	any  right  on, or give a cause of  action  to,	 theaggrieved  Government  servant to go to a court of  law	 andvindicate his rights.Mr.   Pathak,  learned	counsel	 for  the   respondent,	  incountering this argument contends that the constitution Actsin India embodied the incidents of the tenure of the Crown'spleasure in the relevant provisions and what the  Parliamentcan  do	 in England, the appropriate Legislatures  in  Indiaalso  can do, that is, "the tenure at pleasure"	 created  bythe Constitution Acts can be abrogated, limited or  modifiedby  law	 enacted  by  the  appropriate	legislative  bodies.Alternatively  he contends that even if the Police Act	doesnot curtail the tenure at pleasure, the Legislature  validlymade  that  law and the Government  validly  made  statutoryrules in exercise of the powers confered under that Act	 andthat,  therefore,  the	appropriate  authorities  can	onlydismiss	 the  respondent  in  strict  compliance  with	 theprovisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.To  appreciate	the  problem  presented	 and  to  afford   asatisfactory  answer it would be convenient to consider	 therelevant provisions.  The Act we are concerned with in	thiscase is the Police Act, 1861 (Act V692of  1861).  Its constitutional validity at the time  it	 was,made was not questioned.  Under s. 7 of the Police Act,  asit originally stood, "the appointment of all police officersother than those mentioned in B. 4 of this Act shall,  undersuch  rules as the local Government shall from time to	timesanction,   rest   with	  the	Inspector-General,    DeputyInspectors-General,    Assistant   Inspectors-General	 andDistrict  Superintendents  of Police, who  may,	 under	suchrules as aforesaid, at any time, dismiss, suspend or  reduceany  police-officer."  That section was substituted  by	 thepresent section in 1937 and later on some appropriate amend-ments  were  made  to  bring  it  in  conformity  with	 theConstitution.	Under the amended section, "Subject to	suchrules  as  the State Government may from time to  time	makeunder  this Act, the Inspector-General,	 Deputy	 Inspectors-General,    Assistant	Inspectors-General   and    DistrictSuperintendent of Police may at any time dismiss, suspend orreduce any police officer of the subordinate ranks whom theyshall  think  remiss or negligent in the  discharge  of	 hisduty,  or  unfit for the same".	 In exercise of	 the  powersconferred  on  the  Government	by s. 46  of  the  Act,	 theGovernment made the U. P. Police Regulations prescribing theprocedure  for	investigation and inquiry.  We	shall'	dealwith the Regulations at a later stage.In the Government of India Act, 1915, as amended by the	 Actof  1919,  for the first time, the doctrine  of	 "tenure  atpleasure"  was	introduced by s. 96-B.	In exercise  of	 thepower  conferred  under sub-s.	(2)  certain  classificationrules  were  framed by the local Government.  This  Act	 wasrepealed  by  the  Government of India Act,  1935,  and	 thesection corresponding to s. 96-B was s. 240(1) in the latterAct.  Section 241(2) empowered, except as expressly providedby  the	 Act,  the  Governor-General  and  the	Governor  toprescribe  the	conditions of service of the  servants	theywere empowered to appoint.The main difference between the Act of 1919 and that of 1935was that in the former Act there was only one limitation  onthe Crown's pleasure, namely, that no person in the  servicemight be dismissed by693an authority subordinate to that by which he was  appointed,whereas	 in the latter Act a second limitation was  imposed,namely, that no such person should' be dismissed or  reducedin rank until he had been given a reasonable opportunity  ofshowing	 cause	against the action proposed to be  taken  inregard	to  him: see s. 240, sub-ss. (2) and  (3).   Anotherdifference  between the said two Acts was that	while  underthe  former  Act all the services were placed  in  the	sameposition,  -under the latter Act special provision was	madefor  the  police force prescribing that	 the  conditions  ofservice	 of  the  subordinate ranks of	the  various  policeforces should be such as might be determined by or under theActs relating to those forces respectively-vide s. 243.	  Bythe  Constitution, the Act of 1935 was repealed,  and,	withcertain changes in phraseology, cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 310took   the  place  of  sub-ss.	(1)  and  (4)  of   s.	 240respectively,  and  Art. 309 took the place  of	 s.  241(2).Under  Art.  313,  "Until other provision is  made  in	thisbehalf	under  this  Constitution, all	the  laws  in  forceimmediately before the commencement of this Constitution andapplicable to any public service or any post which continuesto exist after the commencement of this Constitution, as  anall-India service or as service or post under the Union or aState shall continue in force so far as consistent with	 theprovisions  of this Constitution".  The result is  that	 thePolice	Act and the Police Regulations, made in exercise  ofthe  powers  conferred	on the Government  under  that	Act,which  .were  preserved under s. 243 of	 the  Government  ofIndia  Act,  1935, continue to be in force  after  the	Con-stitution so far as they are consistent with the  provisionsof the Constitution.It  is	common case, as the contentions of  learned  counseldisclose, that the Act and the Regulations framed thereunderwere  constitutionally valid at the inception and that	theyare also consistent with the provisions of the Constitution.The difference between the two contentions lies in the	factthat  according	 to  one His Majesty's	pleasure  cannot  bemodified 88694by  a  statute,	 according to the other	 it  is	 subject  tostatutory  provisions.	 The  relevant	provisions  of	 theConstitution read thus:Article	  309:	 "Subject   to	the   provisions   of	thisConstitution,  Acts  of	 the  appropriate  Legislature	 mayregulate  the  recruitment,  and conditions  of	 service  ofpersons	  appointed,  to  public  services  and	  posts	  inconnection with the affairs of the Union or of any State:Provided  that	it shall be competent for the  President  orsuch  person  as he may direct in the case of  services	 andposts  in connection with the affairs of the Union, and	 forthe  Governor of a State or such person as he may direct  inthe  case  of  services and posts  in  connection  with	 theaffairs	  of  the  State,  to  make  rules  regulating	 therecruitment,  and  the	conditions  of	service	 of  personsappointed,  to	such services and posts until  provision  inthat  behalf is made by or under an Act of  the	 appropriateLegislature under this article, and any rules so made  shallhave effect subject to the provisions of any such Act."Article	  310:	"Except	 as  expressly	provided   by	thisConstitution,  every  person who is a member  of  a  defenceservice	 or of a civil service or holds any  post  connectedwith defence or any Civil Post under the Union holds  officeduring	the pleasure of the President, and every person	 whois a member of a civil service of a State or holds any civilpost  under a State holds office during the pleasure of	 theGovernor of the State."Under Art. 309 the appropriate Legislature may regulate	 therecruitment  and conditions of service of persons  appointedto  public services.  Under Art. 310 every person who is  ECmember	of a public service described therein  holds  officeduring the pleasure of the President or the Governor, as thecase may be.  The words "conditions of service" in Art.	 309in  their comprehensive sense take in the tenure of a  civilservant:  see  N.  W.  F.  Province  v.	 Suraj	Narain	(1).Therefore,  "the  tenure  at pleasure" is also	one  of	 theconditions of service.	But Art. 309 opens out with a(i)  A.I.R. (1949) P.C. 112.695restrictive  clause, namely, "Subject to the  provisions  ofthis  Constitution", and if there is no restrictive,  clausein Art. 310, there cannot be any difficulty in holding	thatArt. 309 is subject to the provisions of' Art 310; with	 theresult	that  the power of the Legislature to lay  down	 theconditions  of	service	 of  persons  appointed	 to   publicservices would be subject to "the tenure at pleasure"  underArt.  310.  In that event, any law made by  the	 Legislaturecould  not affect the over-riding power of the President  orthe  Governor, as the case may be, in putting an end to	 thetenure	at their pleasure.  Would the opening words  of	 theclause in Art. 310, namely, "Except as expressly provided bythis  Constitution",  make any difference in the  matter  ofinterpretation?	  It should be noticed that the	 phraseologyof  the	 said clause in Art. 310 is different from  that  inArt. 309.  If there is a specific provision in some part  ofthe  Constitution  giving to a Government servant  a  tenuredifferent   from  that	provided  for  in  Art.	 310,	thatGovernment  servant is excluded from the operation  of	Art.310.   The said words refer, inter alia, to Arts. 124,	148,218  and  324 which provide that the Judges of	the  SupremeCourt,	the Auditor General, the Judges of the	High  Courtsand  the  Chief Election Commissioner shall not	 be  removed-from their offices except in the manner laid down in  thoseArticles.    If	  the	provisions   of	  the	Constitutionspecifically  prescribing  different tenures  were  excludedfrom Art. 310, the purpose of that clause would be exhaustedand  thereafter	 the Article would be free  from  any  otherrestrictive  operation.	  In that event, Arts. 309  and	 310should be read together, excluding the opening words in	 thelatter	Article,  namely, "Except as expressly	provided  bythis  Constitution".   Learne counsel seeks to	confine	 theoperation of the opening words in Art. 309 to the provisionsof the Constitution which empower other authorities to	makerules  relating	 to  the conditions of	service	 of  certainclasses of public servants, namely, Arts. 146(2), 148(5) and229(2).	 That may be so, but there is no reason why Art. 310should	be excluded therefrom.	It follows that	 while	Art.310 provides for a tenure at pleasure696of  the	 President  or the Governor, Art.  309	enables	 theLegislature or the executive, as the case maybe, to make anylaw or rule in regard, inter alia, to conditions of  servicewithout impinging upon the overriding power recognized underArt. 310.Learned	 counsel  for  the  respondent	contends  that	thisconstruction  is  inconsistent with that prevailing  in	 theEnglish	 law  and that the intention of the framers  of	 theConstitution could not have been to make a radical departurefrom the law of England.  The law of England on the doctrineof "tenure at pleasure" has now become fairly  crystallized.In England, all servants of the Crown hold office during thepleasure  of the Crown; the right to dismiss at pleasure  isan  implied  term  in every contract of	 employment  of	 theCrown,	this doctrine is not based upon any  prerogative  ofthe Crown, but on public policy; if the terms of appointmentdefinitely   prescribe	a  tenure  for	good  behaviour	  orexpressly  provide  for a power, to determine for  a  cause,such  an  implication of a power to dismiss at	pleasure  isexcluded, and an Act of Parliament can abrogate or amend thesaid doctrine of public policy in the same way as it can  doin  respect  of	 any other part of  common  law.   The	saidpropositions  are  illustrated in the  following  decisions:Shenton	 v.  Smith (1), Gould v. Stuart (2), Reilly  v.	 TheKing(3),  Terrell v. Secretary of State (4).   This  Englishdoctrine was not incorporated in its entirety in the  Indianenactments-vide State of Bihar v. Abdul Majid (5), ParshotamLal  Dhingra  v. Union of India (6).  Section  96-B  of	 theGovernment  of India Act, 1915, for the first time in  1919,by  amendment, statutorily recognized this doctrine, but  itwas made subject to a condition or s qualification,  namely,that  no  person in that service might be dismissed  by	 anyauthority  subordinate	to that by which he  was  appointed.Section	 240 of the Act of 1935 imposed another	 limitation,namely,	 that  a  reasonable opportunity  of  showing  causeagainst the action proposed to be taken in(i)   [1895] A.C. 229.(3)  [1934] A.C. 176.(5)  [1954] S.C.R. 786.(2)  [1896] A.C. 575.(4)  (1953) 2 All E R. 490.(6)  [1958] S.C.R. 828.697regard to a person must be given to him.  But neither of thetwo Acts empowered the appropriate Legislature to make a lawabolishing or amending the said doctrine.  The	Constitutionof India practically incorporated the provisions of ss.	 240and  241 of the Act of 1935 in Arts. 309 and 310.   But	 theConstitution  has not made "the tenure at pleasure"  subjectto  any	 law made by the appropriate  Legislature.   On	 theother  hand, as we have pointed out, Art. 309  is  expresslymade subject to "the tenure at pleasure" in Art. 310.Nor  the  attempt of learned counsel for the  respondent  todiscover  such a power in the Legislature in the Entries  ofthe  appropriate  Lists	 of  the  Seventh  Schedule  to	 theConstitution  can be legally sustained.	 He referred,  interalia, to Entry 70 of List I and Entry 41 of List II.  It  isnot   disputed	that  Parliament  can  make  law   for	 theorganization  of  the  police and  for	the  prevention	 anddetection of crime.  But under Art. 245 of the	Constitutionsuch   a  power	 is  subject  to  the  provisions   of	 theConstitution and, therefore, is subject to the provisions ofArt. 310.Nor  can  we  imply  such  a  power  in	 Parliament  or	 theLegislatures from Art. 154(2)(b) of the Constitution.  UnderArt. 154, "the executive power of the State shall be  vestedin  the	 Governor  and	shall be  exercised  by	 him  eitherdirectly   or  through	officers  subordinate  to   him	  inaccordance  with  this	Constitution", and  under  el.	2(b)thereof,  "nothing in this Article shall prevent  Parliamentor  the	 Legislature  of the State from	 conferring  by	 lawfunctions on any authority subordinate to the Governor." Theargument  is  that  a  power to	 terminate  the	 service  atpleasure under Art. 310 is a part of the executive power  ofthe State, that power under Art. 154 can be exercised by theGovernor  directly or through officers subordinate  to	him,and  that  under  Art.	154(2)(b)  the	Parliament  or	 theLegislature  of the State can confer the same power  on	 anyauthority  subordinate to the Governor or, at any rate,	 canmake a law prescribing that the Governor shall exercise	 thesaid pleasure through a particular officer.698We  cannot agree either with the premises or the  conclusionsought to be based on it.  The first question is whether thepower  of  the	Governor under Art.  310  to  terminate	 theservices of a Government servant at pleasure is part of	 theexecutive  power  of  the  State  under	 Art.  154  of	 theConstitution.  Article 154 speaks of the executive power  ofthe State vesting in the Governor; it does not deal with theconstitutional powers of the Governor which do not form partof the executive power of the State.  Article 162 says that,subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the executivepower  of the State shall extend to matters with respect  towhich  the Legislature of the State has power to make  laws.If  the Legislature of the State has no power to make a	 lawaffecting  the tenure at pleasure of the Governor, the	saidpower  must  necessarily  fall	outside	 the  scope  of	 theexecutive  power of the State.	As we will  presently  show,the Legislature has no such power and, therefore, it  cannotbe a part of the executive power of the State.	That  apart,if  the	 said power is part of the executive  power  in	 itsgeneral	 sense, Art. 162 imposes another limitation on	thatpower,	namely, that the said executive power is subject  tothe provisions of the Constitution and therefore, subject toArt.  310  of the Constitution.	 In either  view,  Art.	 310falls  outside	the scope of Art. 154 of  the  Constitution.That  power  may  be  analogous to  that  conferred  on	 theGovernor  under	 Arts.	174, 175  and  176.   Doubtless	 theGovernor  may  have to exercise the said power	whenever  anoccasion   arises,   in	 the  manner   prescribed   by	 theConstitution, but that in itself does not make it a part  ofthe  executive power of the State or enable him to  delegatehis power.Even  on  the assumption that the power under  Art.  310  isexecutive power within the meaning of Art. 154, it does	 notmake  any  difference in the legal position so	far  as	 thepresent case is concerned.  Article 310 of the	Constitutionsays that unless expresssly provided by the Constitution  tothe  contrary, every civil servant holds office	 during	 thepleasure   of  the  Governor  subject  to  the	 limitationsprescribed under699Art.  311.   Can it be said that  Art.	154(2)(b)  expresslyprovides  for a different tenure?  Can it be said  that	 thesaid Article confers on the Parliament or the Legislature  apower  higher than that conferred on them under Art. 245  ofthe  Constitution  ?  It only preserves	 the  power  of	 theLegislature, which it has under the Constitution, to make  alaw conferring functions on an authority subordinate to	 theGovernor.   That power under Art. 245 is not unlimited,	 butis subject to the provisions of the Constitution and  there-fore subject to Art. 310 thereof.It is then said that if the appellants' contention were	 notaccepted,  it would lead to conflict of jurisdiction:  whilethe  Governor  has  the power under Art. 310  to  dismiss  apublic servant at his pleasure, a statute may confer a poweron  a subordinate officer to dismiss a servant only  subjectto  conditions; a subordinate officer functioning  under  anAct  may not be able to dismiss a servant, but the  Governormay be able to do so under similar circumstances; a subordi-nate  officer  may dismiss a servant, but the  Governor	 mayorder his continuance in office.This argument is based upon the misapprehension of the scopeof  Art.  309  of  the Constitution.   A  law  made  by	 theappropriate  Legislature or the rules made by the  Presidentor the Governor, as the case may be, under the said  Articlemay  confer a power upon a particular authority to remove  apublic	servant from service; but the conferment of  such  apower  does  not amount to a delegation	 of  the  Governor'spleasure.  Whatever the said authority does is by virtue  ofexpress power conferred on it by a statute or rules made  bycompetent authorities and not by virtue of any delegation bythe Governor of his power.  There cannot be conflict betweenthe  exercise of the Governor's pleasure under Art. 310	 andthat  of  an authority under a statute,	 for  the  statutorypower would be always subject to the overriding pleasure  ofthe Governor.This conclusion, the argument proceeds, would throw a publicservant	 in India to the mercy of the  executive  Governmentwhile their compeers in England700can be protected by legislation against arbitrary actions ofthe  State.   This  apprehension has no	 real  .basis,	for,unlike	in England, a member of the public service in  Indiais  constitutionally protected at least in  two	 directions:(i)  he cannot be dismissed by an authority  subordinate  tothat by which he was appointed; (ii) he cannot be dismissed,removed	 or  reduced  in  rank until he	 has  been  given  areasonable  opportunity of showing cause against the  actionproposed to be taken in regard to him.	A condition  similarto  the first condition in Art. 311 found in s. 96-B of	 theGovernment  of	India Act, 1919, was hold  by  the  JudicialCommittee  in  R. T. Bangachari v. Secretary  of  State	 forIndia  (1)  to	have  a	 statutory  force,  and	 the  secondcondition,  which  is only a reproduction of that  found  insub-section  (2) of s. 240 of the Government of	 India	Act,1935,  was  held  in High Commissioner for  India  and	HighCommissioner  for  Pakistan v. I. M. Lall (2)  as  mandatoryqualifying  the	 right of the employer	recognized  in	sub-section (1) thereof.  These two statutory protections to theGovernment  servant are now incorporated in Art. 311 of	 theConstitution.	This Article imposes two  qualifications  onthe  exercise  of  the	pleasure of  the  President  or	 theGovernor  and they quite clearly restrict the  operation  ofthe  rule embodied in Art. 310(1)-vide the  observations  ofDas,  C.J.,  in Dhingra's case (3).  The most  important  ofthese  two limitations is the provision prescribing  that  acivil  servant	shall be given a reasonable  opportunity  ofshowing	 cause against the -action proposed to be  taken  inregard	to  him.  As this condition is a limitation  on	 the"tenure	 at  pleasure",	 a  law can  certainly	be  made  byParliament defining the content of "reasonable	opportunity"and   prescribing   the	 procedure  for	 giving	  the	saidopportunity.   The  appropriate High Court and	the  SupremeCourt can test the validity of such a law on the basis	whe-ther   the  -provisions	 prescribed  provide  for  such	  anopportunity,  and, if it is valid, to ascertain whether	 thereasonable  opportunity so prescribed is really given  to  aparticular officer.  It may be that the(1) (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 40.  (2) (1948) L.R. 75 1.A. 225.(3) [1958] S.C.R. 828, 839.701framers	 of  the Constitution, having  incorporated  in	 ourConstitution   the  "tenure  at	 pleasure"   unhampered	  bylegislative interference, thought that the said	 limitationsand qualifications would reasonably protect the interests ofthe civil servants against arbitrary actions.The  discussion yields the following results: (1)  In  Indiaevery  person who is a member of a public service  describedin  Art.  310 of the Constitution holds	 office	 during	 thepleasure  of the President or the Governor, as the case	 maybe, subject to the express provisions therein. (2) The powerto dismiss a public servant at pleasure is outside the scopeof  Art.  154  and, therefore, cannot be  delegated  by	 theGovernor  to a subordinate officer, and can be exercised  byhim  only in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.	 (3)This tenure is subject to the limitations or  qualificationsmentioned  in  Art.  311  of  the,  Constitution.  (4)	 TheParliament  or the Legislatures of States cannot make a	 lawabrogating  or modifying this tenure so as to  impinge	uponthe  overriding	 power conferred upon the President  or	 theGovernor  under Art. 310, as qualified by Art. 311. (5)	 TheParliament  or	the Legislatures of States can	make  a	 lawregulating the conditions of service of such a member  whichincludes proceedings by way of disciplinary action,  withoutaffecting the powers of the President or the Governor  underArt. 310 of the Constitution read with Art. 311 thereof. (6)The  Parliament	 and the Legislatures also can	make  a	 lawlaying	down  and regulating the scope and  content  of	 thedoctrine of "reasonable opportunity" embodied in Art. 311 ofthe  Constitution;  but	 the said law would  be	 subject  tojudicial  review.  (7)	If  a  statute	could  be  made	  byLegislatures  within the foregoing permissible	limits,	 therules  made  by	 an  authority	in  exercise  of  the  powerconferred  thereunder would likewise be	 efficacious  withinthe said limits.What  then is the effect of the said propositions  in  theirapplication  to	 the provisions of the Police  Act  and	 therules made thereunder?	The Police Act of897021861  continues	 to  be good  law  under  the  Constitution.Paragraph  477	of the Police Regulations  shows  that	 therules  in Chapter XXXII thereof have been framed under s.  7of  the Police Act.  Presumably, they were also made by	 theGovernment  in exercise of its power under s. 46(2)  of	 thePolice	Act.   Under para. 479(a) the  Governor's  power  ofpunishment with reference to all officers is preserved; thatis  to say, this provision expressly saves the power of	 theGovernor  under Art. 310 of the Constitution.	"Rules	madeunder  a  statute  must	 be  treated  for  all	purposes  ofconstruction  or obligation exactly as if they were  in	 theAct and are to be of the same effect as if contained in	 theAct,  and are to be judicially noticed for all	purposes  ofconstruction   or   obligation":   see	 Maxwell   "On	 theInterpretation	of  Statutes",	10th  edn.,  pp.  5051.	 Thestatutory  rules  cannot be described as, or  equated  with,administrative	directions.  If so, the Police Act  and	 therules  made  thereunder	 constitute  a	self-contained	codeproviding  for'	 the  appointment. of  police  officers	 andprescribing  the  procedure for their removal.	 It  followsthat  where  the appropriate  authority	 takes	disciplinaryaction under the Police Act or the rules made thereunder, itmust  conform to the provisions of the statute or the  ruleswhich  have  conferred upon it the power to  take  the	saidaction.	  If there is any violation of the said	 provisions,subject	 to  the question which we will	 presently  considerwhether	 the  rules are directory or mandatory,	 the  publicservant would have a right to challenge the decision of thatauthority.Learned counsel for the appellants relied upon the followingdecisions of the Privy Council and this Court in support  ofhis  contention	 that  the  said  rules	 are  administrativedirections: R. T. Rangachari v. Secretary of State for India(1),  R.  Venkata Rao v. Secretary of State for	 India	(2),High  Commissioner  for	 India	and  High  Commissioner	 forPakistan v. I. M. Lall (3), S. A. Venkataraman v. The  Unionof  India(4), and Khem Chand v. The Union of  India(5).	  InVenkata Rao's(1)  (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 40.(3)  (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 225.(2)   (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 55.(4)  [1954] S.C.R. 1150.(5)   [1958] S.C.R. 1080.703case (1) a reader of the Government Press was dismissed	 andin the suit filed by him against the Secretary, of State forIndia  he  complained, inter alia, that	 the  dismissal	 wascontrary  to the statute inasmuch as it was not preceded  byany such inquiry as was prescribed by rule XIV of the  CivilServices  Classification Rules made under s. 96B(2)  of	 theGovernment  of	India Act.  Under s. 96B of  the  said	Act,every  person  in  civil service  holds	 office	 during	 thepleasure  of His Majesty.  Sub-section (2) of  that  sectionempowers  the  Secretary of State for India  to	 make  ruleslaying	down, among others, the conditions of  service,	 andsub-s. (5) declares that no rules so made shall be construedto  limit or abridge the power of the Secretary of State  inCouncil	 to  deal with the case of any person in  the  civilservice	 of the Crown in India in such manner as may  appearto  him	 to be just and equitable. - On	 a  construction  ofthese  provisions  the	Judicial  Committee  held  that	 HisMajesty's  pleasure was paramount and could not	 legally  becontrolled or limited by the rules.  Two reasons were  givenfor  the  conclusion, namely, (i) s. 96B  in  express  termsstated	that  the office was held during  the  pleasure	 andthere was no room for the implication of a contractual	termthat  the rules were to be observed; and (ii) sub-s. (2)  ofs. 96B and the rules made careful provisions for redress  ofgrievances  by	administrative process and that	 sub-s.	 (5)reaffirmed the superior authority of the Secretary of  Statein  Council over the civil service.  It may be noticed	thatthe  rules framed in exercise of the power conferred by	 theAct was to regulate the exercise of His Majesty's  pleasure.The observations were presumably coloured by the doctrine of"tenure	 at pleasure" obtaining in England, namely, that  itcould only be modified by statute, influenced by the princi-ple that the rules made under a statute shall be  consistentwith  its  provisions  and,  what  is  more,  based  upon  aconstruction  of the express provisions of the	Act.   Theseobservations  cannot, in our opinion, be taken out of  theircontext	 and applied to the provisions of  our	Constitutionand  the Acts of our Legislatures in derogation of the	wellsettled principles of(1) (1936) L. R. 64 I. A. 55.704statutory  construction.  In Bangachari's case (1) a  policeofficer was dismissed by an authority subordinate to	thatby which he had been appointed.	 The appeal was heard  alongwith  that  in Venkata Rao's case (2) and the  judgments  inboth  the  appeals  were delivered on  the  same  day.	 TheJudicial Committee distinguished Venkata Rao's case (2) withthe following observations at p. 53:"It  is	 manifest  that the stipulation	 or  proviso  as  todismissal  is  itself  of statutory force and  stands  on  afooting	 quite other than any matters of rule which  are  ofinfinite variety and can be changed from time to time."These  observations do not carry the matter further  an	 ourremarks made in connection with Venkata Rao's case (2) wouldequally apply to this case.  I.M. Lall's case (3) turns uponsub-s.	(3) of s. 240 of the Government of India Act,  1935.Again the Judicial Committee made a distinction between	 therules  and the provisions of the Act and ruled that  sub-ss.(2) and (3) of s. 240 indicated a qualification or exceptionto the antecedent provisions in sub-s. (1) of s. 240.	Thisdecision only adopted the reasoning in the earlier decision.The remarks made by us in connection with Venkata Rao's case(2) would equally apply to this decision.  This Court in  S.A.   Venkataraman's  case  (4)	incidentally   noticed	 theobservations of the Judicial Committee in Venkata Rao's case(2) and observed that the rules, which were not incorporatedin a statute, did not impose any legal restriction upon	 theright  of  the Crown to dismiss its  servants  at  pleasure.This Court was not laying down any general proposition,	 butwas only stating the gist of the reasoning in Venkata  Rao'scase (2).  Das, C.J., if we may say so, correctly stated thescope of the rule in Venkata Rao's case (2) in the  decisionin Khem Chand's case (5), when he stated at p. 1091-"The  position	of the Government  servant  was,  therefore,rather	insecure,  for	his office  being  held	 during	 thepleasure  of  the Crown under the Government of	 India	Act,1915, the rules could not override(1)  (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 40.(3)  (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 225.(2)  (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 55.(4)  [1954] S.C.R. 1150.(5)   [1958] S.C.R. 1080.705or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rulescould not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statuteitself."To state it differently, the Government of India Act,  1915,as  amended in 1919, and that of 1935 expressly and  clearlylaid down that the tenure was at pleasure and therefore	 therules framed under that Act must be consistent with the	 Actand  not  in  derogation of it.	  These	 decisions  and	 theobservations made therein could not be understood to mark  aradical	  departure  from  the	fundamental   principle	  ofconstruction that rules made under a statute must be treatedas  exactly as if they were in the Act and are of  the	sameeffect	as  if	contained  in the  Act.	  There	 is  anotherprinciple equally fundamental to the rules of  construction,namely,	 that  the  rules  shall  be  consistent  with	 theprovisions  of	the  Act.  The	decisions  of  the  JudicialCommittee on the provisions of the earlier Constitution Actscan  be	 sustained  on the ground that	the  rules  made  inexercise  of power conferred under the Acts cannot  overrideor  modify the tenure at pleasure provided by s. 96B  or  s.240  of the said Acts, as the case may be.  Therefore,	whenthe paramountcy of the doctrine was conceded or declared  bythe  statute,  there  might  have  been	 justification	 forsustaining  the rules made under that statute in  derogationthereof	 on  the ground that they were	only  administrativedirections, for otherwise the rules would have to be  struckdown as inconsistent with the Act.  In such a situation,  ifthe statute was valid-it would be valid in so far as it	 didnot derogate from the provisions of Art. 310, read with Art.311-the rules made thereunder would be as efficacious as theAct  itself.   So  long as the statute and  the	 rules	madethereunder  do not affect the power of the  Governor-in	 thepresent case the Governor's pleasure is expressly preserved-they  should  be legally enforceable.  In this	context	 thedecisions of the different High Courts in India are cited atthe  Bar.  It would not serve any purpose to consider  everyone  of them in detail.	 It would suffice if  their  generaltrend  be  noticed.  They express two divergent	 views:	 oneline relies upon the observations706of the Privy Council in Venkata Rao's case (1) and lays downthat   all  statutory  rules  vis-a-vis	  the	disciplinaryproceedings   taken   against  a  Government   servant	 areadministrative	directions, and the other applies  the	wellsettled rules of construction and holds that the appropriateauthority  is bound to comply with the mandatory  provisionsof  the	 rules	in  making an  inquiry	under  a  particularstatute.   A  close  scrutiny  of  some	 of  the   decisionsdiscloses  a  distinction  implied,  though  not  expressed,between	 statutory  rules defining the scope  of  reasonableopportunity  and those governing other procedural  steps  inthe  disciplinary  process.   In our view,  subject  to	 theoverriding power of the President or the Governor under Art.310,  as qualified by the provisions of Art. 311, the  rulesgoverning  disciplinary	 proceedings cannot  be	 treated  asadministrative directions, but shall have the same effect asthe  provisions of the statute whereunder they are made,  inso  far a,-, they are not inconsistent with  the  provisionsthereof We have already negatived the contention of  learnedcounsel that the Governor exercises his pleasure through theofficers specified in s. 7 of the Police Act, and therefore,it  is not possible to equate the Governor's  pleasure	withthat of the specified officers' statutory power.  If so,  itfollows	 that  the inquiry under the Act shall	be  made  inaccordance   with   its	 provisions  and  the	rules	madethereunder.Then  learned counsel contends that even if the	 said  ruleshave  statutory force, they are only directory and the	non-compliance  with the rules will not invalidate the order  ofdismissal made by the appropriate authority.Before	we  consider the principles governing  the  questionwhether	 the rules are mandatory or directory, it  would  beconvenient at this stage to notice broadly the scope and thepurpose of the inquiry contemplated by the rules.Section	  2  of	 the  Police  Act  constitutes	the   policeestablishment; s. 7 empowers specified officers to(1)  [1936] L.R. 64 I.A. 55.707punish	specified  subordinate officers who  are  remiss  ornegligent  in  discharge of their duties or  unfit  for	 thesame;  s.  46  enables	the Government	to  make  rules.  toregulate the procedure to be followed by the magistrate	 andpolice officers in discharge of any duty imposed on them  byor under the Act; under s. 7, read with s. 46 of the  PoliceAct,  the Police Regulations embodied in chapter XXXII	wereframed.	  Paragraph  477 of the Regulations  says  that	 therules  in  that	 chapter have been made under s.  7  of	 thePolice	Act and apply only to officers appointed under s.  2of  the Police Act and that no officer appointed under	thatsection shall be punished by executive order otherwise	thanin  the	 manner	 provided in that  chapter.   Paragraph	 478prescribes the nature of the punishment that can be  imposedon   the  delinquent  officers.	  Paragraph   479   empowersspecified officers to punish specified subordinate officers.Paragraph  483	gives the procedure to be  followed  in	 thematter of the inquiry against a police officer.	 It reads:"Subject to the special provision contained in paragraph 500and  to	 any  special  orders which may	 be  passed  by	 theGovernor  in particular cases a proceeding against a  policeofficer will consist of-A-A magisterial or police inquiry, followed, if this inquiryshows the need for further action, byB-A  judicial  trial, orC-A departmental trial, or both,  consecutively."Paragraph 484 declares that the nature of the inquiry in anyparticular  -case will vary according to the nature  of	 theoffence.   If the offence is cognizable	 or  non-cognizable,the inquiry will be according to Schedule II of the CriminalProcedure  Code.   If  the information is  received  by	 theDistrict Magistrate, he may in exercise of his powers  underthe  Criminal  Procedure Code either, (1) make	or  order  amagisterial  inquiry; or (2) order an investigation  by	 thePolice.	 Paragraph 485 reads: "When	a magisterial inquiry is ordered it will be made  inaccordance   with  the	Criminal  Procedure  Code  and	 theSuperintendent of Police will have no direct708concern with it until the conclusion of judicial proceedingsor until and unless the case is referred to him for  furtherdisposal,  but he must give any assistance to the  inquiringmagistrate that he may legally be called upon to give and hemust suspend the accused should this become necessary  underparagraph  496."  Paragraph 486 says that there	 can  be  nomagisterial  inquiry under the Criminal Procedure Code	whenthe  offence alleged against a police officer amounts to  anoffence	 only under s. 7 of the Police Act, and it  providesfurther	 that in such cases, and in, other cases  until	 andunless	a  magisterial inquiry is ordered, inquiry  will  bemade under the direction of the Superintendent of Police  inaccordance  with the rules given thereunder.  Under  rule  Ithereof, "Every information received by the police  relatingto  the	 commission  of a cognizable  offence  by  a  policeofficer shall be dealt with in the first place under ChapterXIV, Criminal Procedure Code, according to law, a case underthe  appropriate  section  being registered  in	 the  policestation	 concerned".  There are six provisos to	 that  rule.Rule  II  provides  for	 the  inquiry  of  a  non-cognizableoffence; and rule III prescribes the procedure in regard  toan  offence  only  under s. 7 of the Police Act	 or  a	non-cognizable  offence  of which the Superintendent  of  Policeconsiders  unnecessary at that stage to forward a report  inwriting	 to  the District Magistrate.  Paragraph  488  dealswith  a	 judicial trial and para. 489  with  a	departmentaltrial.	Paragraph 489 says:"A police officer may be departmentally tried under  section7 of the Police Act-(1)  after he has been tried judicially;(2)  after a magisterial inquiry under the CriminalProcedure Code;(3)    after  a	 police	 investigation	under  the  CriminalProcedure  Code	 or a departmental enquiry  under  paragraph486,III above."There  are  other  provisions dealing  with  the  manner  ofconducting  the inquiries and other connected matters.	 Therules  provide	for  the  magisterial  and  police   inquiryfollowed, if the inquiry showed the need for further action,by a judicial trial or a departmental709trial,	or both, consecutively.	 In the case  of  cognizableoffences  the  Superintendent  of  Police  is  directed	  toinvestigate under chapter XIV of the Criminal Pro- p, cedureCode  and  in  the case of non-cognizable  offences  in	 themanner provided in rule II of para. 486, and in the case  ofan  offence  only  under s. 7 of the Police Act	 or  a	non-cognizable offence in the manner provided under rule III  ofpara. 486.  After one or other of the relevant procedure  isfollowed, the Superintendent of Police is empowered to try apolice officer departmentally.The  question is whether rule I of para. 486  is  directory.The  relevant  rule says that the police  officer  shall  betried  in the first place under chapter XIV of the  CriminalProcedure Code.	 The word "shall" in its ordinary import  is"obligatory";  but  there  are many  decisions	wherein	 thecourts under different situations construed the word to mean"may".	 This  Court  in Hari Vishnu Kamath  v.	 Syed  AhmadIshaque (1) dealt with this problem at p. 1125 thus:"It is well established that an enactment in form  mandatorymight in substance be directory and that the use of the word"shall" does not conclude the matter."It is then observed:"They  (the rules) are well-known, and there is no  need  torepeat	them.	But  they  are all of  them  only  aids	 forascertaining the true intention of the legislature which  isthe  determining factor, and that must ultimately depend  onthe context."The  following quotation from Crawford "On the	Constructionof Statutes", at p. 516, is also helpful in this connection:"The  question	as  to whether a  statute  is  mandatory  ordirectory depends upon the intent of the legislature and notupon  the  language  in which the intent  is  clothed.	 Themeaning	 and intention of the legislature must	govern,	 andthese  are to be ascertained, not only from the	 phraseologyof  the provision, but also by considering its	nature,	 itsdesign, and the(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1104.90710consequences  which would follow from construing it the	 oneway or the other......" This  passage was approved by this Court in State of U.  P.v. Manbodhan Lal Srivastava (1).  In Craies on Statute	Law,5th edition, the following passage appears at p. 242:"No universal rule can be laid down as to whether  mandatoryenactments shall be considered directory only or  obligatorywith  an implied nullification for disobedience.  It is	 theduty  of  Courts  of  Justice to try  to  get  at  the	realintention  of the Legislature by carefully attending to	 thewhole scope of the statute to be construed."A  valuable  guide  for ascertaining the  intention  of	 theLegislature  is found in Maxwell on "The  Interpretation  ofStatutes", 10th edition, at p. 381 and it is:"On  the  other hand, where the prescriptions of  a  statuterelate	to  the performance of a public duty and  where	 theinvalidation  of  acts done in neglect of  them	 would	workserious	 general inconvenience or injustice to	persons	 whohave  no control over those entrusted with the duty  withoutpromoting  the	essential  aims	 of  the  legislature,	suchprescriptions  seem  to	 be  generally	understood  as	mereinstructions  for  the guidance and government of  those  onwhom  the duty is imposed, or, in other words, as  directoryonly.  The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it doesnot  affect  the validity of the act done  in  disregard  ofthem."This  passage was accepted by the Judicial Committee of	 thePrivy Council in the case of Montreal Street Railway Companyv.  Normandin  (2 ) and by this Court in State of U.  P.  v.Manbodhan Lal Srivastava (1).The  relevant rules of interpretation may be briefly  statedthus: When a statute uses the word "shall", prima facie,  itis mandatory, but the Court may ascertain the real intentionof the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scopeof the statute.	 For ascertaining the real intention of	 theLegislature  the Court may consider, inter alia, the  natureand the design of the statute, and the consequences which(1) [1958] S.C.R. 533, 545.(2) L.R. [1917] A.C.770.711would  follow from construing it the one way or	 the  other,the  impact  of other provisions whereby  the  necessity  ofcomplying  with the provisions in question is  avoided,	 thecircumstance,  namely,	that  the  statute  provides  for  acontingency  of the non-compliance with the provisions,	 thefact  that the non-compliance with the provisions is  or  isnot  visited  by  some	penalty,  the  serious	or   trivialconsequences  that flow therefrom, and, above  all,  whetherthe object of the legislation will be defeated or furthered.Now what is the object of rule I of para. 486 of the  PoliceRegulations?   In our opinion, it is conceived not  only  toenable	the Superintendent of Police to	 gather	 informationbut  also to protect the interests of  subordinate  officersagainst whom departmental trial is sought to be held.  Aftermaking the necessary investigation under chapter XIV of	 theCriminal Procedure Code, the Superintendent of Police may aswell  come to the conclusion that the officer  concerned  isinnocent, and on that basis drop the entire proceedings.  Hemay   also  hold  that	it  is	a  fit	case  for   criminalprosecution,  which, under certain circumstances, an  honestofficer against whom false charges are framed may prefer  toface  than  to	submit	himself	 to  a	departmental  trial.Therefore,the  rules  are conceived in the interest  of	 thedepartment as well as the officer.  From the stand point  ofthe  department	 as  -well  as	the  officer  against	whomdepartmental   inquiry	is  sought  to	be   intiated,	 thepreliminary  inquiry is very important and it serves a	realpurpose.   Here the setting aside of the order of  dismissalwill  not  affect  the	public	in  general  and  the	onlyconsequence  will  be  that  the officer  will	have  to  beproceeded  against  in the manner prescribed by	 the  rules.What  is  more, para. 487 and para. 489 make  it  abundantlyclear  that  the  police investigation	under  the  CriminalProcedure Code is a condition precedent for the departmentaltrial.	 Paragraph 477 emphasizes that no officer  appointedunder s. 2 of the Police Act shall be punished by  executiveorder  otherwise than in the manner provided  under  chapterXXXII  of  the Police Regulations.  This  is  an  imperativeinjunction prohibiting712inquiry	 in  non-compliance with the rules.   Paragraph	 489only empowers the holding of a departmental  trial in regardto a police officer only after a police investigation  underthe  Criminal  Procedure  Code.	 When a	 rule  says  that  adepartmental   trial  can  be  held  only  after  a   policeinvestigation, it is not permissible to hold that it can  beheld  without  such investigation.  For	 all  the  foregoingreasons,  we hold that para. 486 is mandatory and  that,  asthe investigation has not been held under chapter XIV of theCriminal  Procedure  Code, the subsequent  inquiry  and	 theorder of dismissal are illegal.For  the foregoing reasons we hold that, as  the  respondentwas dismissed without complying with the provisions of para.486(1), the order of dismissal is illegal and that the	HighCourt is right in setting aside the order of dismissal.In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.WANCHOO, J.-We regret we are unable to agree that the appealbe dismissed.Babu Ram Upadhya (respondent) was a sub-inspector of  policewho was appointed in December, 1948.  In 1953, he was postedat  Sitapur.  On September 6, 1953, he was returning from  avillage	 called	 Madhwapur,  when  he  saw  a  man  who	 wassubsequently found to be Tika Ram coming from the side of  acanal  and going hurriedly into a field.  The  movements  ofTika  Ram roused his suspicion.	 One Lalji,  an	 ex-patwari,was  also with the sub-inspector.  Tika Ram was	 called	 andsearched, and a bundle containing currencynotes was found onhim.   The  sub-inspector took the bundle  and	counted	 thenotes  and  handed them over to Lalji.	Lalji  in  his	turnhanded over the notes to Tika Ram.  Thereafter Tika Ram, whois an old-man, almost blind, went away.	 When he reached hishouse,	he found that there was a shortage of Rs.  250.	  Hethen  made  a complaint to the Superintendent of  Police  onSeptember  9,  1953, in which he gave the above	 facts.	  Aninquiry	 was  made  by	the  Superintendent  of	 Police	 andultimately,  departmental  proceedings	under s.  7  of	 thePolice Act were taken713against	 the respondent.  These proceedings resulted in	 hisdismissal  and thereupon the respondent applied to the	HighCourt under Art. 226 of the Constitution.The main contention of the respondent was that r. 486 of thePolice	Regulations framed under s. 7 of the Police Act	 wasnot  observed  and therefore  the  departmental	 proceedingstaken against him were illegal.	 The reply of the  appellantwas  two-fold: in the first place, it was urged that r.	 486did not apply as there was no report of a cognizable offenceagainst	 the  sub-inspector; and in the next place,  it	 wasurged  that  the rules contained in the	 Police	 Regulationswere  only administrative rules and even if there  was	non-compliance  with  any  of  them, it  would  not	 affect	 thedepartmental  proceedings  taken  against  the	 respondent,provided there was no breach of the guarantees contained  inArt. 311 of the Constitution.The High Court held that there was a report of a  cognizableoffence	 under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code	against	 therespondent  and therefore the procedure provided by  r.	 486ought  to have been followed.  It further held that  r.	 486had  been  framed  under s. 7 of the Police Act	 and  was  astatutory  provision, which had the force of law.  As  such,following  the earlier view taken by the High Court  in	 twoother  cases  it  held	that a	dismissal  as  a  result  ofdepartmental proceedings which took place without  complyingwith  r.  486 would be illegal.	 In  consequence,  the	writpetition  was  allowed.	 The appellant then  applied  for  acertificate to enable it to appeal to this Court, which	 wasrefused.   Thereupon special leave was prayed for from	thisCourt,	which  was granted; and that is how the	 matter	 hascome up before us.Mr.  C.	 B. Aggarwala on behalf of the appellant  urges	 thesame  two  points before us.  So far as the first  point  isconcerned,  we are of opinion that there is no force in	 it.There  is no doubt that in the complaint made by  Tika	Ram,the name of the respondent was not shown in the heading; butfrom the facts disclosed in the body of the complaint it  isclear that the sub-inspector searched the person of Tika Ramand recovered a bundle containing currency-notes.  He714did  so	 obviously under the authority vested in  him  as  apolice officer.	 When therefore he was satisfied that  therewas  no reason to take any further action against Tika	Ram,it  was his duty to see that the entire amount taken by	 himfrom Tika Ram on search was returned to him (Tika Ram).	 TheHigh  Court  was right in the view that	 where	property  istaken  away with the intention that it will continue  to  bethe property of the person from whose possession it has beentaken away, there will be an entrustment of the property  tothe  person taking it away, and if. subsequently the  persontaking	it away converts it to his own use or  suffers	someother  person  to do so, there will be	criminal  breach  oftrust  and  not merely criminal misappropriation.   Thus  anoffence	 under	s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code	 appears  tohave  been committed prima facie on the facts of this  case.As  an offence under s. 409 is a cognizable offence, r.	 486of  the Police Regulations would apply.	 This brings  us  tothe main point in the present appeal.Sec. 7 of the Police Act under which r. 486 has been  framedis in these terms:-"Subject to such rules as the State Government may from timeto  time make under this Act, the Inspector-General,  DeputyInspectors-General,    Assistant   Inspectors-General	 andDistrict Superintendents of Police may at any time  dismiss,suspend	 or  reduce any police-officer -of  the	 subordinateranks  whom  they  shall think remiss or  negligent  in	 thedischarge of his duty or unfit for the same;or  may award any one or more, of the following	 punishmentsto  any police-officer of the subordinate ranks,  who  shalldischarge  his	duty in a careless or negligent	 manner,  orwho,  by any act of his own shall render himself  unfit	 forthe discharge thereof, name-(a) fine to any amount not exceeding one month'spay;  (b) confinement to quarters for a term  not  exceedingfifteen	 days,	with  or without  punishment,  drill,  extraguard, fatigue or other duty;(c)  deprivation of good-conduct pay;715    (d)	  removal from any office of distinction or  specialemolument;".It gives power to four grades of police officers to dismiss,suspend	 or  reduce any police officer	of  the	 subordinateranks  whom they think remiss or negligent in the  dischargeof  his	 duty or unfit for the same.  It also  provides	 forinfliction  of four other kinds of punishment by these	fourgrades of officers on any police officer of the	 subordinateranks  who  discharges his duty in a careless  or  negligentmanner	or who by any act of his own renders  himself  unfitfor  the  discharge  thereof.  In the present  case  we	 areconcerned  with	 dismissal and what we shall  say  hereaftershould be taken to be confined to a case of dismissal.	Sec-tion 7 shows that the power of dismissal conferred by it  onthe  four  grades  of police officers  is  to  be  exercisedsubject to such rules as the State Government may from	timeto time make under the Police Act.  The contention on behalfof  the respondent is that the power of dismissal has to  beexercised subject to rules and therefore, when r. 486 of thePolice	Regulations (framed under s. 7) provided  a  certainprocedure  to be followed with respect to cases in  which  acognizable  offence  was  involved it was not  open  to	 theauthority concerned to disregard that procedure.  In effect,it  is urged that r. 486 is a mandatory provision  and	non-compliance   with  it  would  invalidate  the	departmentalproceedings.   It  is not in dispute in this case  that	 theprocedure  provided  by	 r.  486  was  not  followed.	Thatprocedural provision is that where a report of a  cognizablecrime  is  made against a police officer  belonging  to	 thesubordinate  ranks, it has to be registered as	provided  inChapter	  XIV  of  the	Code  of  Criminal   Procedure	 andinvestigated   as  provided  thereunder.    Thereafter	 theauthority  concerned has to decide whether to send the	casefor  trial  before a court of law or  to  take	departmentalproceedings.   In  this	 case no report	 was  registered  asprovided under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedureand  no investigation was made as provided in that  Chapter.All  that happened was that the Superintendent of Police  towhom Tika Ram had complained inquired into the716complaint  of  Tika  Ram and thereafter decided	 to  hold  adepartmental  inquiry under s. 7 of the Police	Act  againstthe respondent.The  main contention on behalf of the appellant is that	 theRules framed under s. 7 of the Police Act are administrativerules  and  in	any case they are only	directory  and	non-compliance  with  them	would  not  vitiate  the  subsequentproceedings  unless  there  is a  breach  of  the  guaranteecontained  in  Art. 311 of the Constitution, as	 all  publicservants hold their office at the pleasure of the  Presidentor  the	 Governor,  as the case may  be,  other	 than  thoseexpressly excepted under the Constitution.  Reliance in thisconnection  is	placed	on the case of	R.  Venkata  Rao  v.Secretary of State for India in Council (1).This  brings  us to a consideration of the tenure  on  whichpublic	servants  hold office.	The position in	 England  isthat all public servants hold office at the pleasure of	 HisMajesty, that is to say, their service was terminable at anytime  without  amuse: (see Shenton v. Smith (2 )).  By	law,however,  it is open to Parliament to prescribe a  differenttenure and the King being a party to every Act of Parliamentis understood to have accepted the change in the tenure whenhe  gives  assent to such law: (see Gould  v.  Stuart  (3)).This  principle applied in India also before the  Governmentof  India Act, 1915, was amended by the addition of s.	96-Btherein.   Section  96-B  for the  first  time	provided  bystatute that every person in the civil service of the  Crownheld  office during His Majesty's pleasure, subject  to	 theprovisions of the Government of India Act and the rules madethereunder  and	 the  only protection to  a  public  servantagainst	 the exercise of pleasure was that he could  not  bedismissed  by any authority subordinate to that by which  hewas  appointed.	  It  was  this	 section,  which  came	 forconsideration before the Privy Council in Venkata Rao's case(1)  and the Privy Council held that in spite of  the  words".subject  to the rules made under the Government  of  IndiaAct," Venkata Rao's employment was not of a(1) (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 55	  (2) [1895] A.C. 229.(3)  [1896] A.C. 575.717limited	 and  special  kind during pleasure  with  an  addedcontractual term that the procedure prescribed, by the Rulesmust  be  observed; it was by the express terms of  s.	96-Bheld "during His Majesty's pleasure" and no right of  actionas  claimed  by	 Venkata Rao  existed.	 The  Privy  Councilfurther	 held  that the terms of s. 96-B  assured  that	 thetenure	of office, though at pleasure, would not be  subjectto capricious or arbitrary action but would be regulated  bythe  rules  which were manifold in number,  most  minute  inparticularity  and all capable of change; but there  was  noright  in the -public servant enforceable by action to	holdhis  office  in	 accordance with those rules  and  he  couldtherefore  be  dismissed  notwithstanding  the	failure	  toobserve	 the procedure prescribed by them.  The	 main  pointwhich was urged in Venkata Rao's case (1) was that under  r.XIV  of	 the Civil Services Classification Rules  no  publicservant	 could	be  dismissed, removed or  reduced  in	rankexcept	after a properly recorded departmental inquiry.	  InVenkata	 Rao's case (1) the departmental inquiry  prescribedby the rules was found not to have been held.  Even so,	 thePrivy Council held that the words used in s. 96-B could	 notand  did not cut down the pleasure of His Majesty  by  rulesthough	it  was	 observed  that the  terms  of	the  sectioncontained a statutory and solemn assurance, that the  tenureof  office,  though at pleasure., would not  be	 subject  tocapricious  or arbitrary, action, but would be regulated  byrule.	It  was further added that supreme  care  should  betaken  that this assurance is carried out in the letter	 andin the spirit.	The Privy Council further held that in'	 thecase  before  it,  there had been  a  serious  and  completefailure to adhere to important and indeed fundamental rules,and mistakes of a serious kind had been made and wrongs	 hadbeen  done which called for redress; even so; they  were  ofthe  view  that	 as a matter of law  that  redress  was	 notobtainable from courts by action..,.This  was  the position under the Government  of  India	 Act1915.  There was however a material change in the Governmentof India Act, 1935.  So far, there(1)  (1936) L.R. 64 I. A. 55.91718was  one  protection to a public servant, namely,  that	  hecould not be dismissed by an authority subordinate   to thatby which he was appointed.  In the Government of India	Act,1935, s. 240(1) laid down that--" except as expressly provided by this Act, every person whois  a member of a civil service of the Crown in	 India......holds office during His Majesty's pleasure."The words of this section are different from those of s. 96-B  and	the tenure of all public servants other	 than  thoseexpressly  provided  for  was to  be  during  His  Majesty'spleasure.   There were, however, two safeguards provided  bysub-ss.	 (2)  and  (3) of s. 240.  The first  was  the	same(namely,  that	no public servant will be  dismissed  by  anofficer	 subordinate  to  that who  appointed  him);  but  afurther exception was added to the pleasure tenure,  namely,no public servant shall be dismissed until he has been givena reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the actionproposed to be taken in regard to him.	This protection cameto  be considered by the Privy Council in High	Commissionerfor  India and High Commissioner for Pakistan v. 1. M.	Lall(1)  and it was held that it was a mandatory  provision	 andqualified  the	pleasure  tenure and  provided	a  conditionprecedent  to the exercise of power by His Majesty  providedby  sub-s. (1) of s. 240.  Thus by the Government  of  IndiaAct,  1935,  there were two statutory guarantees  to  publicservants  against  the	exercise  of  the  pleasure  of	 hisMajesty;  but it is clear from s. 240 of the  Government  ofIndia Act, 1935, that the pleasure of His Majesty to dismisswas  not  otherwise  subject  to  rules	 framed	 under	 thesubsequent  provisions	of  the	 Government  of	 India	 Actappearing  in  Chapter	11 of Part  X  dealing	with  publicservices.This  position continued till we come to  the  Constitution.Article	 310(1)	 of the Constitution provides for  what	 wascontained in s. 240(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935,and is in these terms:"(1)  Except  as expressly provided  by	 this  Constitution,every person who -is a member of a defence(1)  (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 225.719service	 or  of a civil service of the Union or	 of  an	 allIndia  service or holds any post connected with defence,  orany  civil  post under the Union, holds	 office	 during	 thepleasure of the President, and every person who is a  memberof a civil service of a State or holds any civil post  undera State holds office during the pleasure of the Governor  ofthe State."It  will be clear therefore that all public servants  exceptas expressly provided by the Constitution hold their  officeduring the pleasure of the President or the Governor, as thecase  may be.  Article 311 then provides for two  guaranteesand  is	 similar  in  terms to s.  240(2)  and	(3)  of	 theGovernment of India Act, 1935 and the two guarantees are thesame,  (namely,	 (i) that no person shall  be  dismissed  orremoved by an authority subordinate to that by which he	 wasappointed,  and	 (ii) no such person shall be  dismissed  orremoved or reduced in rank until he has been given a reason-able  opportunity  of  showing	cause  against	the   actionproposed  to be taken in regard to him).  In  Parshotam	 LalDhingra v. Union of India (1), this Court held that Art. 311was in the nature of a proviso to Art. 310, that it providestwo  constitutional guarantees cutting down the pleasure  ofthe President or the Governor, as the case may be, and	thatit  was a mandatory provision which had to be complied	withbefore the pleasure provided in Art. 310 can be exercised.Mr.  Pathak  for the respondent urges that in  view  of	 thewords  of Art. 310 statute or statutory rules can  also	 cutdown the nature of the pleasure tenure provided by Art.	 310in the same way as in England an Act of Parliament cuts downthe  ambit  of	His  Majesty's pleasure	 in  the  matter  ofdismissal.  He relies on the words "as expressly provided bythis Constitution" and urges that it is open to the legisla-ture  to cut down the pleasure tenure by law or	 to  providefor  its  being	 affected  by  statutory  rules.   In	thisconnection he relies on Art. 309 as well as Art. 154 of	 theConstitution.  Now, Art. 309 begins with the words  "subjectto the provisions of this Constitution" land lays down	that"Acts  of  the	appropriate  Legislature  may  regulate	 therecruitment, and conditions of(1) [1958] S.C.R. 828.720service of person appointed, to public services and posts inconnection  with the affairs of the Union or of any  State".The  proviso  to  Art.	309 lays  down	that  "it  shall  becompetent for the President or the Governor as the case	 maybe  to make rules relating to recruitment and conditions  ofservice	 until provision in that behalf is made by or  underan  Act of the appropriate Legislature".  It will  be  clearimmediately  that Art. 309 is subject to the  provisions  ofthe  Constitution  and	therefore subject to  Art.  310	 andtherefore,  any	 law passed or rules framed under  Art.	 309must be subject to Art. 310 and cannot in any way affect thepleasure-tenure laid down in Art. 310.	The words "except asexpressly  provided by this Constitution" appearing in	Art.310  clearly show that the only exceptions to  the  pleasuretenure are those expressly contained in the Constitution andno more.  These exceptions, for example, are contained interalia  in  Arts. 124. 148, 280 and 324 and also in  Art.	 310(2).  Therefore, unless there is an express provision in theConstitution cutting down the pleasure tenure, every  publicservant holds office during the pleasure of the President orthe  Governor,	as the case may be.  We	 cannot	 accept	 theargument  that	a  law passed  under  Art.  309	 prescribingconditions  of service would become an express provision  ofthe Constitution and would thus cut down the pleasure tenurecontained  in  Art. 310.  As the Privy	Council	 pointed  inVenkata	 Rao's case (1), the rules framed under Art. 309  orthe laws passed thereunder amount to a statutory and  solemnassurance that the tenure of office though at pleasure	willnot be subject to capricious or arbitrary action but will beregulated  by rule.  But if the rules or the law define	 thecontent of the guarantee contained in Art. 311 (2) they	 mayto that extent be mandatory but only because they carry	 outthe  guarantee contained in Art. 311 (2).   Excepting  this,any  law or rule framed under Art. 309 cannot cut  down	 thepleasure tenure as provided in Art. 310.The  same in our opinion applies to a law passed under	Art.154 (2)(b) which authorises Parliament or the legislature ofa State to confer functions on any(1) (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 55.721authority subordinate to the Governor.	If any law is passedconferring  on any authority the power to dismiss or  removeor  reduce in rank, that law cannot cut down the content  ofthe pleasure tenure as contained in Art. 310; that law wouldbe  passed under Art. 245 and that article also begins	withthe words "subject to the provisions of this  Constitution".Therefore, the law passed under Art. 154 (2) (b) would	alsoin the same way as the law under Art. 309 be subject to	 thepleasure  tenure contained in Art. 310 and cannot  cut	downthe content of that tenure or impose any further fetters  onit  except  those  contained  in  Art.	311.   The  positiontherefore that emerges from the examination of the  relevantArticles  of  the Constitution is that all  public  servantsother	than  those  who  are  excepted	 expressly  by	 theprovisions  of	the  Constitution  hold	 office	 during	 thepleasure  of the President or the Governor, as the case	 maybe, and that no law or rule passed or framed under Art.	 309or Art. 154 (2) (b) can cut down the content of the pleasuretenure as contained in Art. 310 subject to Art. 311.With this basic position in our Constitution, let us turn tothe  Police  Act  with which we are  concerned.	  Section  7thereof	 lays  down that four grades of officers  will	havepower  to dismiss, suspend or reduce any  police-officer  ofthe  subordinate  ranks subject to such rules as  the  StateGovernment may from time to time make under the Police	Act.Though the Police Act is a pre-constitutional law which	 hascontinued  under Art. 372 of the Constitution, it cannot  inour opinion stand higher than a law passed under Art. 309 orArt.  154 (2) (b) and out down the content of  the  pleasuretenure as contained in Art. 310.  The police officers of thesubordinate  ranks  are	 not  expressly	 excluded  from	 theoperation  of  the pleasure tenure by any provision  of	 theConstitution;  they,  therefore,  hold	office	during	 thepleasure  of the Governor and the only protection that	theycan claim are the two guarantees contained in Art. 311.	  Itis true that s. 7 lays down that the four grades of officersempowered  to dismiss will act according to rules framed  bythe State Government; but that does not in our opinion	meanthat722these  rules  could  introduce any  further  fetter  on	 thepleasure  tenure  under	 which the police  officers  of	 thesubordinate  ranks  are	 in service.  It  was  necessary  toprovide	 for  the  framing  of	rules  because	the  sectionenvisages  conferment  of, powers of punishment	 of  variouskinds on four grades of officers relating to various  cadresof police officers in the subordinate ranks.  It was left tothe  rules  to provide which four grades of  officers  woulddismiss	 police officers of which subordinate rank or  wouldgive   which  punishment  to  a	 police	 officer  of   whichsubordinate  rank.   Such  rules would	in  our	 opinion  bemandatory as they go to the root of the jurisdiction of	 thefour grades of police officers empowered to act under s.  7.But  further rules may be framed under s. 7 to	guide  thesepolice	officers how to act when they proceed to dismiss  orinflict	 any  other  punishment on police  officers  of	 thesubordinate  ranks.   These  rules  of	procedure,  however,cannot	all be mandatory, for if they were so they would  beputting	 further fetters than those provided in Art. 311  onthe  pleasure of the Governor to dismiss a  public  servant.of  course, if any of the rules framed under s. 7 carry	 outthe  purposes  of Art. 311(2), to that extent they  will  bemandatory  and	in that sense their contravention  would  insubstance  amount to contravention of Art. 311	itself.	  Ifthis  were  not so, it would be possible  to  forge  furtherfetters on the pleasure of the Governor to dismiss a  publicservant and this in the light of what we have said above  isclearly	 not  possible	in view of  the	 provisions  of	 theConstitution.  On the other hand, it will not be possible bymeans of rules framed under s. 7 to take away the  guaranteeprovided  by  Art. 311(1), which lays down  that  no  publicservant	 shall be dismissed by an authority  subordinate  tothat by which he was appointed.	 If any rule under s. 7, forexample, lays down otherwise it will clearly be ultra  viresin view of Art. 311(1).	 The rules therefore that are framedunder  s.  7 would thus be of two kinds,  namely  (1)  thosewhich define the jurisdiction of four grades of officers  toinflict	 a  particular kind of punishment  on  a  particularpolice	 officer  of  the  subordinate	rank-they  will	  bemandatory723for  they go to the root of the jurisdiction of the  officerexercising the power, but even these rules cannot go againstthe  provisions of Art. 31 1 (1); and (2) procedural  rules,which again may be of two kinds.  Some of them may prescribethe manner in which the guarantee contained in Art. 311	 (2)may be carried out and if there are any such rules they willbe  mandatory.	The rest will be merely procedural  and	 canonly  be directory as otherwise if they are  also  mandatoryfurther	 fetters on the power of the Governor to dismiss  athis pleasure contained in Art. 310 would be forged and	thisis not permissible under the Constitution.  It is from	thisangle that we shall have to consider 486.Before, however, we come to r. 486 itself, we may dispose ofanother	 argument, namely, that the four grades of  officerswho have the power to dismiss under s. 7 are exercising	 thestatutory  authority vested in them and are  not  exercisingthe  Governor's	 pleasure of dismissal under  Art.  310	 andtherefore  their action in dismissing an officer is  subjectto  all	 the  rules framed for their guidance.	 We  are  ofopinion	 that  this  argument is  fallacious.	Article	 310defines	 the  pleasure tenure and by  necessary	 implicationgives  power  to  the Governor to dismiss  at  pleasure	 anypublic	servant subject to the exceptions contained in	Art.310  and  also subject to the guarantees contained  in	Art.311.	  This power of the Governor to dismiss is executivepower of the State and can be exercised under Art.     154(1)by  the	 Governor  himself directly  or	 indirectly  throughofficers  subordinate  to  him.	  Thus it  is  open  to	 theGovernor  to  delegate his power of  dismissal	to  officerssubordinate  to him; but even when those  officers  exercisethe   power  of	 dismissal,  the  Governor   is	  indirectlyexercising it through those to whom he has delegated it	 andit  is still the pleasure of the Governor to dismiss,  whichis  being exercised by the subordinate officers to  whom  itmay be delegated.  Further though the Governor may  delegatehis executive power of dismissal at pleasure to	 subordinateofficers he still retains in himself the power to dismiss atpleasure if he thinks fit in a particular case in spite724of  the delegation.  There can be no question that  where  adelegation  is	made, the authority  making  the  delegationretains in itself what has been delegated.  Therefore,	evenwhere  a  subordinate  officer is exercising  the  power  todismiss	 he  is	 indirectly  exercising	 the  power  of	 theGovernor  to  dismiss  at  pleasure  and  so  his  power  ofdismissal  can	only be subject to the same  limitations  towhich  the  power  of the Governor would be  subject  if  heexercised it directly.But  it is said that in the present case the power  has	 notbeen delegated by the Governor under Art. 154(1) and that ithad been conferred on those police officers by law.  In	 ouropinion,  that	makes  no difference to the  nature  of	 thepower,	which  is being exercised by these  four  grades  ofofficers under the Police Act.	As we have already said Art.154(2)(b) gives power to Parliament or the legislature of  aState	by  law	 to  confer  functions	on   any   authoritysubordinate to the Governor.  When the function of dismissalis  conferred  by law on any authority	subordinate  to	 theGovernor   it  is  nothing  more  than	delegation  of	 theGovernor's  executive power to dismiss at pleasure by  meansof law and stands in no better position than a delegation bythe  Governor  himself	under Art. 154(1).   Whether  it  isdelegation  by	the  Governor  himself	or  whether  it	  isdelegation  by	law under Art. 154(2)(b) or by	an  existinglaw, which must be treated as analogous to a law under	Art.154(2)(b), the officer exercising the power of dismissal  isonly indirectly exercising, the Governor's power to  dismissat  pleasure and his order of dismissal has the same  effectas  the	 order	of  the Governor  to  dismiss  at  pleasure.Therefore, his order also is only subject to the two fettersprovided  in  Art.  311 of the Constitution  and  cannot  besubjected to any more fetters by procedural rules other thanthose  framed  for carrying out the object of  Art.  311(2).Therefore,  when  the  four grades of  officers	 proceed  todismiss any police officer of the subordinate rank under  s.7  of the Police Act, they are merely exercising. the  powerof  the Governor to dismiss at pleasure indirectly; and	 theonly  fetters  that can be placed on that  power  are  thosecontained in the Constitution, namely,	Art. 311.725We  may in this connection refer once again to the  case  ofVenkata	 Rao  (1)  where the dismissal was  by	an,  officersubordinate  to the Governor of Madras; but' that  dismissalwas also held to be an indirect exercise I of His  Majesty'spleasure to dismiss, and that is why it was held that if  r.XIV  of	 the Classification Rules was not complied  with,  apublic	servant	 had  no right of action  against  an  orderdismissing  him	 at  His  Majesty's  pleasure.	  Therefore,whenever  a  subordinate  officer  exercises  the  power  todismiss, whether that power is delegated by the Governor, oris delegated under a law made under Art. 154(2)(b) or  underan  existing law analogous to that, he is merely  exercisingindirectly the power of the Governor to dismiss at  pleasureand  his  action  -is subject only  to	the  two  guaranteescontained  in Art. 311.	 The fact therefore that the  policeofficer	 in this case made the order of dismissal by  virtueof s. 7 will make no difference and he will be deemed to  beexercising the power of the Governor to dismiss at  pleasureby delegation to him by law of that power.  We may add	thateven  where there is delegation by law of the power  of	 theGovernor  to dismiss at pleasure, the power of the  Governorhimself	 to act directly and dismiss at pleasure  cannot  betaken away by that law, for that power he derives from	Art.310 of the Constitution.  The present case therefore must bejudged	on the same basis as any case of dismissal  directlyby  the	 Governor  and	would only be  subject	to  the	 twolimitations contained in Art. 311.We  now	 come  to r. 486.  This rule,  as  we  have  alreadyindicated,  provides that if there is any complaint  of	 thecommission  of any cognizable crime by a police officer,  itmust  be  registered in the relevant police  station,  underChapter	  XIV  of  the	Code  of  Criminal   Procedure	 andinvestigated in the manner provided by that Chapter.   Afterthe  investigation is complete, it is open to the  authorityconcerned,  be	it  the	 Superintendent	 of  Police  or	 theDistrict Magistrate, to decide whether to proceed in a courtof law(1) (1936) L.R. 64 I.A. 55.92726or to hold a departmental inquiry or do both, though in	 thelast  case  the departmental inquiry must  take	 place	onlyafter  the judicial trial is over.  The first question	thenthat  arises  is whether r. 486 is meant to  carry  out	 thepurpose	 of Art. 311(2).  As we read r. 486, we	 cannot	 seethat  it is meant for that purpose; it only provides  for  apolice	investigation  under  Chapter XIV  of  the  Code  ofCriminal   Procedure.	 The  police   officer	 making	  aninvestigation under Chapter XIV is not bound to examine	 theperson	against	 whom he is investigating, though  there  isnothing	 to  prevent him from doing so.	 Nor is	 the  personagainst whom an investigation is going on under Chapter	 XIVbound  to make a statement to the police officer.  In  thesecircumstances, the purpose of an investigation under ChapterXIV  is	 not relevant under Art. 311(2) which  says  that  apublic	servant shall not be dismissed without giving him  areasonable  opportunity of showing cause against the  actionproposed  to be taken in regard to him.	 Therefore,  r.	 486not  being meant for the purpose of carrying out the  objectof Art. 311 (2) cannot be mandatory and cannot add a furtherfetter on the exercise of the power to dismiss or remove  atthe  pleasure of the Governor over and above the  guaranteescontained in Art. 311.It  appears  to	 us that the object of r. 486  is  that	 theauthority concerned should first make a preliminary  inquiryto  find  out  if  there  is  a	 case  against	the  officercomplained  against either to proceed in a court or to	takedepartmental action.  The investigation prescribed by r. 486is only for this purpose.  Incidentally it may be that aftersuch  an investigation, the authority concerned may come  tothe  conclusion	 that there in no case either' to  send	 thecase  to court or to hold a departmental inquiry.  But	thatin our opinion is what would happen in any case of complaintagainst	 a public servant in any department  of	 Government.No  authority  entitled	 to take  action  against  a  publicservant would straightaway proceed to put the case in  courtor to hold a departmental inquiry.  It seems to us axiomaticif a complaint is received against any public servant of anydepartment, that the authority727concerned would first always make some kind of a preliminaryinquiry	 to  satisfy itself whether there is  any  case	 fortaking	action	at all; but that is in our opinion  for	 thesatisfaction of the authority and has nothing to do with theprotection  afforded  to a public servant  under  Art.	311.Rule  486 of the Police Regulations also in our	 opinion  ismeant  for this purpose only and not meant to carry out	 theobject contained in Art. 311(2).  The opportunity  envisagedby Art. 311(2) will be given to the public servant after thethe  authority has satisfied itself by	preliminary  inquirythat  there is a case for taking action.  Therefore, r.	 486which is only meant to gather materials for the satisfactionof  the authority concerned, whether to take action or	not,even  though  a statutory rule cannot be  considered  to  bemandatory  as  that would be forging a further	fetter	thanthose contained in Art. 311 on the power of the Governor  todismiss	 at pleasure.  We are therefore of opinion  that  r.486 is only directory and failure to comply with it strictlyor otherwise will not vitiate the subsequent proceedings.We  may	 incidentally indicate two further  aspects  of	 thematter.	  In  the first place, if the argument is  that	 theGovernor must exercise the pleasure himself so that only thetwo limitations provided in Art. 311 may come into play;  itappears that the Governor has exercised his pleasure in thiscase  inasmuch	as he dismissed the  revisional	 applicationmade  to him by the respondent.	 There appears no reason  tohold  that the Governor exercises his pleasure only when  hepasses	the original order of dismissal but  not  otherwise.Secondly  the fact that r. 486 contains the word "shall"  isnot  decisive  on  the	point that  it	is  mandatory:	(seeCrawford on Statutory Construction, p. 519, para. 262).	  Inview of what we have said already, the context shows that r.486  can  only be directory.  If so, failure to	 observe  itstrictly  or  otherwise will not invalidate  the  subsequentdepartmental proceedings.This  brings  us to the last point which has been  urged  inthis  case;  and  that	is  whether  there  was	 substantialcompliance with r. 486.	 We have already728pointed out that there was no strict compliance with r.	 486as  no case wag registered on the complaint of	    Tika Ramand no investigation was made under Chapter XIV of the	Codeof  Criminal Procedure.	 But there is no doubt in this	casethat  before the Superintendent of Police gave	the  charge-sheet  to  the respondent in November, 1953, which  was	 thebeginning  of  the  departmental  proceedings  against	 therespondent, he made a preliminary inquiry into the complaintof  Tika  Ram and was satisfied that there was	a  case	 forproceeding against the respondent departmentally.  In  thesecircumstances it appears to us that the spirit of r. 486 wassubstantially  complied	 with  and  action  was	 only  takenagainst	 the  respondent when on a preliminary	inquiry	 theSuperintendent	of  Police was satisfied  that	departmentalaction	was  necessary.	 Even if r. 486	 had  been  strictlycomplied  with,	 this is all that could have  happened.	  Inthese  circumstances we are of opinion that r. 486 which  inour opinion is directory was substantially complied with  inspirit and therefore the subsequent departmental proceedingscannot	be held to be illegal, simply because there  was  nostrict compliance with r. 486.	The High Court therefore  inour  opinion  was  wrong  in  holding  that  the  subsequentdepartmental inquiry was illegal and its order quashing	 theorder of dismissal on this ground alone cannot be sustained.We would therefore allow the appeal.BY  COURT-In  accordance with the opinion of  the  majority,this appeal is dismissed with costs.729
