The claims were for amountsabove Rs. 20,000 in the case of some of the petitioners	 andabove Rs. 10,000 in the case of the others.  By r. 5  framedunder  the  Displaced Persons  (Claims)	 Supplementary	Act,1954,  claims could be verified provided, inter	 alia,	thatwhere a claimant had been allotted any agricultural land  inIndia  and  such land so allotted exceeded four	 acres,	 thevalue of the building in respect of which the claim was madeshall  not  be	less than Rs. 20,000 and where	it  did	 notexceed	four  acres  the claim made was not  less  than	 Rs.10,000	Rule 65 of the Displaced Persons  (Compensation	 andRehabilitation) Act, 1954, provided that any person to	whommore than four acres of agricultural land had been  allottedshall not be entitled to receive compensation separately  inrespect	 of  his verified claim for any rural  building	 theassessed  value of which was less than Rs. 20,000,  and	 anyperson	allotted  four	acres or less was  not	entitled  toreceive	 compensation  where  the value was  less  than	 Rs.10,000	The  petitioners  challenged  the  validity  of	 theaforesaid   rules  as  being  discriminatory   and   therebycontravening  Art.  14 of the Constitution of India  on	 thegrounds	 that the object of the various Acts and  the  rulesmade thereunder was to rehabilitate displaced persons but bythe  rules, classifications had been made with reference  tohouses	in rural areas which were discriminatory as  neitherthe  classes were based on intelligible differentia nor	 wasthere  a  rational nexus between that  differentia  and	 theobject	sought	to  be	achieved.  It  was  found  that	 theimpugned  rules were made in pursuance of an  Inter-DominionAgreement  between  the	 two  Governments  with	 regard	  toevaluation   of	  evacuee  property,  which   had   receivedrecognition in Art. 31(5) (b)(iii) of the Constitution.Held, that the impugned rules afforded a reasonable justifi-cation	for the classification and did not  contravene	Art.14 of the Constitution.121JUDGMENT:ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. 44 of 1958.Petition  under	 Art. 32 of the Constitution  of  India	 forenforcement of Fundamental Rights.Naunit Lal and Gopal Singh, for the petitioners.H.   N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, N.   S.Bindra, K. R. Choudhri and R. H. Dhebar, for the  respondent.1960.  October 27.  The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyKAPUPR.	 J.-The petitioners have moved this Court under Art.32  of the Constitution for a writ of mandamus	against	 therespondent   to	 verify	 the  claims  put  forward  by	 thepetitioners  and to grant compensation in  respect  thereof;but  there is little merit to commend the acceptance of	 thepetition.The petitioners are displaced persons from West Punjab whichis  now	 known	as West Pakistan and  have  taken  up  theirresidences  in different parts of India.  They	put  forwardcertain	 claims in regard to village houses which  they	 hadleft  in West Pakistan and which were situate  in  differentvillages.   The petitioners have in their petition  set	 outtheir	respective  claims  which  were	 rejected   by	 theRehabilitation	authorities.   It  is  unnecessary  to	givedetails of the properties in the various villages in  regardto which claims were made.  It is sufficient to say that theclaims were put forward and they were for amounts above	 Rs.20,000	in the case of petitioners Nos.	 1 and 2  and  aboveRs. 10,000 in the case of petitioners Nos. 3The  petitioners  challenge the vires of two  rules--Rule  5under  the  Displaced Persons  (Claims)	 Supplementary	Act,1954, (Act 12 of 1954) and r. 65 of the Rules made under theDisplaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation Act), Act44 of 1954.  The challenge is on the ground of violation  ofArt. 14 of the Constitution.  It is necessary at this  stageto  set	 out  the various Acts and  regulations	 which	werepassed in regard to displaced persons dealing with122verification of their claims and the giving of	compensationto them.On April 1, 1948, the East Punjab Refugees (Registration  ofClaims) Act, 1948, East Punjab Act 8 of 1948, was passed andthis was followed by the East Punjab Refugees  (Registrationof Land Claims) Act 12 of 1948.	 In the latter Act " land  "was defined in s.   2(b) to mean" land which is not occupied as the site of any building  ina  town or village and is occupied or let  for	agriculturalpurposes  or for purposes subservient to agriculture or	 forpasture and includes-(i)  the  sites	 of buildings and other structures  on	suchland;".Under s. 2(a) " claim " was defined as" a statement of loss or damage suffered by a refugee  sincethe  first day of March 1947, in respect of his land  withinthe  territory now comprised in the Province of	 (Punjab  inPakistan),   North   West   Frontier   Province,   Sind	  orBaluchistan,  or  in any State adjac. ent to  the  aforesaidProvinces and acceding to Pakistan ".Section	 4(1) of that Act made provision for submission	 forregistration  of  claims in respect of land abandoned  by  arefugee.On  November 19, 1949, East Punjab Displaced  Persons  (LandSettlement  Act)  1949,	 East Punjab Act  36  of  1949,	 waspassed.	  By s. 2(b) of this Act the word " allottee  "	 wasdefined	 and  by  s.  2(d)  "  land  "	was  defined.	Thisdefinition which was slightly different from the  definitionin the East, Punjab Act (Act 12 of 1948) was as follows:-S.   2(d).   " " Land " means land which is not	 urban	landand is not occupied as the site of any building in a town orvillage and is occupied or let for agricultural purposes  orfor  purposes subservient to agriculture or for pasture	 andincludes-(i)  the  sites	 of buildings and other structures  on	suchland;". On May 18,1950, another Act, the Displaced Persons (Claims)Act  44 of 1950, was passed by the Central Legislature.	  Inthis Act " claim " was defined in123s.   2(a) as " the assertion of a right to the ownership of,or to any interest in-(ii)  such  class of property in any part of  West  Pakistanother  than  in	 any urban area as may be  notified  by	 theCentral Government in this behalf in the Official Gazette;".This Act was in force for two years and then lapsed.   Unders. 2(a)(ii) the Central Government issued a notification  onMay  27, 1950, specifying the property in respect  of  whichclaims might be submitted.  The properties were:-(1)  Any  immoveable property in West Pakistan	which  formspart  of  the  assets of an industrial	undertaking  and  issituate in an area other than an urban area.(2)  Any   other  immoveable  property	in   West   Pakistancomprising of a building situated in an area, other than  anurban  area, the estimated cost of construction of which  atpresent prevailing rates is not less than Rs. 20,000.(3)  Any agricultural land in any part of West Punjab ".This shows that claims could only be submitted in regard  tobuilding  in a rural area which was valued at not less	thanRs.  20,000 and there was no such restriction in  regard  tourban area.  This notification was amended by a notificationdated  September  13,  1950.  Clause  (2)  of  the  previousnotification was substituted by a new clause:"  (2)	Any  other  immoveable	property  in  West  Pakistancomprising  of a building situated in an area other than  anurban area;provided  that	where the person making the claim  hag	beenallotted any agricultural land in India(a) where the  gricultural land so allotted exceeds 4  acresthe  value of the building in respect of which the claim  ismade  shall not, according to the present estimated cost  ofconstruction, be less than Rs. 20,000.(b)  where  the agricultural land so allotted is 4 acres  orless,  the  value of the building in respect  of  which	 theclaim is made shall not, according to the124present	 estimated  cost of construction, be less  than	 Rs.10,000.Explanation 1.......................Explanation  11.   For the purpose of this clause  a  personshall  be deemed to have been allotted agricultural land  inIndia  if he is allotted such land in any manner  whatsoeverwhether on temporary or quasipermanent basis."On   March   23,  1954,	 the  Displaced	  Persons   (Claims)Supplementary  Act, 1954, Act 12 of 1954, was passed and  a.12 provided for the making of rules.  Rule 5 was made in thefollowing terms:-"  R. 5. The classes of property in respect of which  claimsmay be verified under these rules shall be the same as underthe principal Act and the rules made thereunder, that is  tosay(1)  any  immoveable property situated within an urban	areain West Pakistan;(2)  any  immoveable property in West Pakistan, which  formspart  of  the  assets of an industrial	undertaking  and  issituated in any area other than an urban area ;(3)  any   other  immoveable  property	in   West   Pakistancomprising of a building situated in any area other than  anurban area;Provided  that	where  a  claimant  has	 been  allotted	 anyagricultural land in India and that(a)  where  the agricultural land so allotted  exceeds	fouracres,	the  value of the building in respect of  which	 theclaim is made shall not, according to the present  estimatedcost of construction, be less than Rs. 20,000,(b)  where the agricultural land so allotted does not exceedfour  acres, the value of building in respect of  which	 theclaim is made, shall not, according to the present estimatedcost of construction, be less than Rs. 10,000."Explanation  II is in the same terms as in the	notificationof September 13, 1950.On October 9, 1954, the Displaced Persons (Compensation	 andRehabilitation) Act 44 of 1954 (to be hereinafter termed Act44 of 1954) was enacted by Parliament.	Section 2(a) definescompensation pool125which  is constituted under s. 14.  Section 2(e)  defines  "verified claim " as follows :"  " Verified claim " means any claim registered  under	 theDisplaced Persons (Claims) Act, 1950 (44 of 1950) in respectof  which  a final order has been passed under that  Act  orunder  the  Displaced Persons  (Claims)	 Supplementary	Act,1954, but does not includeSection	  4   provided	for  application  for	payment	  ofcompensation.  Section 7 for the determination of the amountof compensation and s. 40 for the making of rules.Rules  were made under this Act by a notification No. S.  R.O. 1363, dated May 21, 1955.  Rule 2(h) defines " urban area"  and a. 2(f) " rural area " which means area which is	 notan   urban  area   Rule	 16  provides  for  the	  scale	  ofcompensation  which is set out in appendix 8 or 9. Under  r.18  compensation was to be determined on the total value  ofall claims which included all kinds of properties other thanagricultural land left by claimants in West Pakistan.	Rule44 deals with allotment of acquired evacuee houses in  ruralareas  in  lieu of compensation.  Under sub-s. (3)  of	thisrule  houses  in  rural areas were graded and  under  r.  47payment	 of  compensation was to be made subject to  r.	 65.Rule  57  provided for allotment of houses  in	addition  toagricultural land.  This rule provided:R.   57.  "  A displaced person having a verified  claim  inrespect of agricultural land who has settled in a rural areaand  to whom agricultural land has been allotted a house  inaddition  to  such  land in accordance	with  the  followingscale-(1)  Claimants allotted land up to Ten Standard acres  Grade(H),(2)  Claimants allotted and exceeding Ten Standard acres butnot exceeding fifty standard acres ............. Grade (G)provided  that	if  such person holds a	 verified  claim  inrespect	 of  any  rural building and  that  claim  has	beensatisfied  wholly or partially before the allotment of	suchland the provisions of rule 65 shall not be126applicable  in his case but he shall not be entitled to	 theallotment  of a house or a site and building grant  in	lieuthereof.Explanation  1-Where  no  house is  available  in  the	samevillage, an allottee may be granted:(a)  if he has been allotted agricultural land not exceedingten standard acres, a site measuring 400 square yards and  abuilding grant of Rs. 400; and(b) if he has been allotted agricultural land exceeding	 tenstandard acres but not exceeding fifty standard acres a sitemeasuring 600 square yards and a building grant of Rs. 600.Explanation  II-The reference to grades in this rule  is  tothe grades of houses specified in rule 44."Rule 61 deals with refusal of acceptance of allotment and isas under:-Rule 61.  " Where any person refuses to accept the allotmentof  any	 agricultural  land offered to	him  the  claim	 forcompensation  of the allottee shall be deemed to  have	beensatisfied  to the extent of the value of the  allotted	landand such land shall be available for allotment to any  otherclaimant."The impugned rule 65 provided:-"   (1)	 Any  person  to  whom	more  than  four  acres	  ofagricultural  land have been allotted shall not be  entitledto  receive  compensation  separately  in  respect  of	 hisverified claim for any rural building the assessed value  ofwhich is less than Rs. 20,000.(2)  Any  person to whom four acres or less of	agriculturalland  have  been allotted shall not be entitled	 to  receivecompensation separately in respect of his verified claim forany rural, building the assessed value of which is less thanRs. 10,000 ".It  was argued on behalf of the petitioners that the  objectof  the	 various Acts and the rules made thereunder  was  torehabilitate   displaced   persons  but	 by  the   rules   aclassification	had  been made which was  discriminatory  asneither	  the  classes	were  based  on	  any	intelligibledifferentia  nor  was there a rational	nexus  between	thatdifferentia  and  the  object sought to	 be  achieved.	 Theclassification,	 according to the argument was: (1)  betweenurban population and rural127population; (2) between refugees from rural areas who  ownedlands and those who owned only rural houses and (3)  betweenthose who had quasi-permanent and permanent allotments.In order to determine the question raised it is necessary totrace  in  chronological order the various  steps  taken  torehabilitate  the  millions of persons who  were  forced  tomigrate into India leaving behind properties worth varyinglylarge amounts.	When displaced persons came from West Punjaband  other  provinces of India which  became  Pakistan,	 theauthorities  allotted to every agricultural  family  certainarea  of  agricultural	land the object being  (1)  to	givetemporary  shelter  to	the displaced  persons	and  (2)  topreserve  whatever crops bad been left by persons  who	wentaway to Pakistan.At  an Inter-Dominion Conference between the Governments  ofIndia  and Pakistan held at Karachi between January  10	 and13,  1949, a permanent Inter-Dominion Commission was set  upto  consider  the  question  of	 administration,  sale	 andtransfer  of  evacuee property in both	the  dominions.	  Inpursuance of this decision the question in respect of  shopsand  houses in rural areas was considered by the  Commissionat  New Delhi on March 11 and 13, 1949.	 It was	 recommendedat  this meeting that buildings in rural areas of the  valueof Rs. 20,000 or more should be considered to be substantialbuildings and the buildings which were of lesser value	thanthat  were to be treated as appendages of agricultural	landand as such were to be treated as " agricultural  properties"  :  vide  the	 minutes of that meeting  at  p.  242  of  acompilation   known  as	 "  Documents	concerning   EvacueeProperty"  of  the years 1947-51.  Chapter IX  of  the	LandResettlement  Manual  for Displaced Persons  by	 Mr.  TarlokSingh,	a  book of undoubted authenticity and  value,  dealswith allotment of rural houses and sites.  Rule 3 shows	 howthe equitable distribution of houses was to be effected.  Inorder to ensure fairness the size of the land allotment madeto a displaced person and the type of house abandoned by himwere considered to be major factors.  For each standard acreallotted128one  mark  was to be given and subject to a  maximum  of  20marks  houses  abandoned in West Punjab were valued  at	 therate  of one mark for each one thousand of the value of	 thehouse and houses above the value of Rs. 20,000 were excludedfor allotment as they were to be dealt with according to theterms  of an earlier agreement between India  and  Pakistan.In  each village after their relative rights had been  valu-ed,  the  allottees  could choose houses  according  to	 thevillage	 list.	In appendix 11 of that book is set  out	 thesummary of principles of allotment of rural evacuee  houses.Evacuee	 houses of kamins (menial servants), artisans,	etc.were to be given to displaced artisans and evacuee shops  toevacuee	  shopkeepers.	 Rule  3  provided  that   temporaryallotment  did not create any rights of allotment on  quasi-permanent  basis but subject to this, allottees were not  tobe  disturbed  if they are otherwise qualified	for  similaraccommodation in the villages.	Elaborate rules are given inthat  Chapter  as to how these allotments were	to  be	madeincluding  partition  of houses where two or  more  familiescould  be  accommodated.  Rule 20 is important	and  may  bequoted :-Rule  20.  "Where necessary, evacuee abadi sites  should  beextended  to  suit  the	 layouts  of  model  villages.	 TheAdditional Deputy Commissioner should endeavour to  persuadethe  allottees	to  surrender a part of	 their	holdings  inexchange  for  land out of the common pool or out  of  areasexcluded from allotment ".Rule 21 gave effect to another Inter-Dominion agreement	 andtherefore  houses of the value of Rs. 20,000 or	 more  whichwere liable to exchange or sale wereexcluded from allotment.Thus according to these instructions contained in that	bookevery  effort was made to allot houses to persons  who	wereallotted lands and in this manner compensation was sought tobe given to displaced persons.By rule 97 made under Central Act 44 of 1954, rehabilitationgrants	to  allottees of agricultural land of  less  than  4acres were to be given as follows:-129R.   97.  " Any person who has been allotted four  acres  orless  of  agricultural land and whose claim  in	 respect  ofrural buildings left in West Pakistan has, by virtue of suchallotment,   been   totally   rejected	may   be   given   arehabilitation great:Provided that-(a)  he has not accepted such allotment of the	agriculturalland or such allotment has been cancelled ;(b)  he	 does  not hold a verified claim in respect  of	 anyother kind of property, that is to say, for any	 substantialrural building andProvided  further  that	 where any such person	is  given  arehabilitation grant under rule 97-A, he shall not be  givena rehabilitation grant under this Rule 97-A provided:-"  Any	person who has been allotted two standard  acres  orless of agricultural land in the State of Punjab or  Patialaand   East  Punjab  States  Union  under  any	notificationspecified  in  Section	10  of	the  Act  may  be  given   arehabilitation	grant  at the rate of Rs. 450  per  standardacre of the area allotted to him.Provided that-(a)  he has not accepted such allotment of the	agriculturalland or such allotment has been cancelled;(b)  he	 does not hold a verified claim in respect  ,of	 anyother  kind  of	 property, that is to  say,  for  any  urbanproperty or for any substantial rural building ".By  Rule  57 which has already been quoted,  houses  of	 allgrades	were allotted to persons who were  allotted  certainareas of land and provision was made for building sites	 andpayment of building grants where no houses were available inthe  villages.	 These rules made under Act 44 of  1954	 andthose  set  out in Land Resettlement Manual  by	 Mr.  TarlokSingh show that every one was allotted or was given buildingsites and money for the purpose of houses in rural areas.The rule in regard to filing of claims for houses valued  atRs. 10,000 or more where allotment of land was up to 4 acresand Rs. 20,000 or more where allotment of land was in excessof  4  acres  was also in  pursuance  of  an  Inter-DominionAgreement between the17130two  Governments  which	 has received  recognition  in	Art.31(5)(b)(iii).	Thus it appears that rules made in regard tofixing of the value of the houses for claim of Rs. 10,000 inone  case and Rs. 20,000 in the other was a policy  decisionarising	 out  of  an agreement at a meeting  of	 the  Inter-Dominion  Commission  with regard to evaluation	 of  evacueeproperty.  Rules which have been framed are only restatementof what was contained in the notifications of May 27,  1950,and September 13, 1950, which themselves were the result  ofdecisions  arrived  at the meetings  of	 the  Inter-DominionCommission.Under  Art. 14 of the Constitution the State shall not	denyto  any	 person	 equality  before  the	law  or	 the   equalprotection of the laws within the territories of India.	  Byjudicial  decisions the doctrine of classification has	beenincorporated in the equality clause, but the  classificationcannot	be  arbitrary  but must be  based  upon	 differencespertinent to the subject in respect of the purpose for whichit  is made.  There must be a reasonable nexus	between	 theclassification	and the object sought to be  achieved.	 Theobject	of the impugned provisions, read with  the  relevantActs, is to rehabilitate the evacuees on an equitable basis.To  implement the scheme of rehabilitation the	evacuee	 lawhas classified evacuees under different categories.  Broadlyspeaking,  the	main division is between  persons  who	wereresiding  in  Pakistan in rural areas  with  agriculture  astheir avocation and those persons who were residing in urbanareas  in  Pakistan.   Persons from rural  areas  have	beendivided	 into  two  categories, namely,	 persons  who  ownedagricultural land with a building as part of the holding andpersons	 who  held  agricultural land  with  an	 independentbuilding  which cannot be described as part of the  holding.Separate treatment is given to rural areas and urban  areas.In  the rural areas, land with a building is treated as	 oneunit, but when the building is of a substantial value it  isput in a different category and separately compensated	for.This  classification has certainly a reasonable relation  tothe  object of rehabilitation, for it cannot be denied	thatthe  three  categories require separate treatments  for	 thepurpose of131resettlement   on   new	 lands	and  for  the	payment	  ofcompensation.It cannot be seriously disputed that a house in a rural areaand  that in an urban area cannot be treated alike, but	 thereal  grievance	 of  the petitioners is in  respect  of	 thedistinction between houses in rural areas.  As to what is  asubstantial  building has to be ascertained and a line	mustbe  drawn somewhere.  Here the question arises	whether	 theclassification	has  been made arbitrarily and	without	 anysound  basis.	It  may perhaps appear odd  to	say  that  aproperty worth Rs. 9,999 in one case or a property worth Rs.19,999	in  another  would be a	 building  of  unsubstantialcharacter or that the extent of the land, namely, four acresin  one	 case  and  above four acres  in  another  have	 anyrelevant  bearing  on the substantiality  of  the  building.This perhaps may lend support to the plea of  discriminationbut an unprecedented situation bad to be faced and provisionmade  for  the rehabilitation of such a	 vast  multitude  ofhumanity  who  had  been uprooted from	their  homes.	Thisnecessitated  an  equitable treatment for them	all  and  anequal distribution of the available evacuee properties	leftin  India.  In order to lighten the heavy burden  undertakenan  Inter-Dominion adjustment became necessary and  the	 twoDominions  entered into an agreement presumably based  uponthe  relevant  circumstances in regard to the  treatment  ofrural	house	property.    The   reasonableness   of	 theclassification	must therefore be judged after taking  thesesurrounding circumstances and the conditions then prevailinginto consideration.  The basis of the classification must bejudged by the fact that compensation is given in every case.Rules  57  and	97-A framed under Act 44 of  1954  afford  areasonable justification for the classification.Under the Rules every displaced person who has settled in  arural area is allotted a house in addition to such land;  ifno  house is available in the same village the	allottee  isgiven a site and a building grant.  But where his claim	 fora house is rejected he is given132a  rehabilitation grant.  But under the impugned  provisionsseparate  compensation is given for a rural house  of  valueabove a prescribed limit.  It will, therefore, be seen	thatthe classification is not arbitrary but is based upon  soundprinciples  and on equitable considerations.  A	 distinctionbetween	 a  rural house which is part of a holding  and	 onewhich is not a part of a holding but an independent unit  ismade and different principles of rehabilitation are  appliedto  meet  different  situations.   The	hardship  which	 thedivision  into	two  categories must  cause  is	 diluted  byproviding to the claimant falling- on the wrong side of	 theline a rural house or a rehabilitation grant.The attack on the ground of want of intelligible differentiamust  fail.  Appendix XI of Land Resettlement Manual by	 Mr.Tarlok	Singh  illustrates the principles  of  allotment  ofrural  evacuee	houses and the elaborate system	 of  markingwhich  was done in order to either give houses to  allotteesof land or to give them building sites with subsidy to buildhouses	and finally in r. 97 and r. 97-A of the	 rules	madeunder  Act  44	of 1954 detailed provisions  were  made	 forrehabilitation grants including grants to those allottees ofagricultural  land whose claim for rural property  had	beenrejected  or who had refused to take land allotted to  them.Similarly  r.  57 which has been quoted above shows  that  aprovision has been made for giving sites as well as  subsidyfor  building houses.  It cannot be said therefore that	 therules	suffer	 from  any  infirmity  on  the	 ground	  ofdiscrimination.In  the	 result this petition fails and	 is  dismissed	withcosts of.Petition dismissed.133
