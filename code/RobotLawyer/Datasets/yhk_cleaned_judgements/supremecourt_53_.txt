The income-tax authorities  did	 notinclude	 in his assessable income, interest received by	 himon arrears of rent, in view of a decision of the Patna	HighCourt, but subsequently this view of law was reversed by thePrivy  Council.	 On August 8, 1948, the	 Income-tax  Officerissued	notices	 under s. 34of the  Indian  Income-tax	Act,1922, for assessing the escaped income.	 Before the  noticeswere  issued the Income-tax Officer had not put	 the  matterbefore the Commissioner for his approval as the section thendid  not  require it and the assessments were  completed  onthose  notices.	  In the meantime, certain  amendments	weremade  to the Indian Income-tax Act by Act 48 of 1948,  whichreceived the assent of the Governor-General on September  8,1948.	The Amending Act substituted a new section in  placeof S. 34, which among other changes, added a proviso to	 theeffect	that  "the  Income-tax Officer	shall  not  issue  anotice...... unless he has recorded his reasons for doing soand the Commissioner is satisfied on such reasons that it isa  fit case for the issue of such notice", and also made  itretrospective  by providing that the new section  "shall  bedeemed	to  have come into force on the 30th day  of  March,1948".	 The question was whether the notices issued by	 theIncome-tax  Officer on August 8, 1948, without the  approvalof  the	 Commissioner, were rendered void by reason  of	 theoperation  of the amended s. 34.  The  Commissioner  claimedthat  s.  6  of the General Clauses  Act,  1897,  saved	 theassessments as well as the notices.Held,  that s. 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897,  was	 in-applicable as the Amending Act of 1948 indicated a differentintention  within the meaning of that section,	inasmuch  asthe  amended  S.  34 of the  Indian  Income-tax	 Act,  1922,provided that it shall be deemed to have come into force  onMarch 30, 1948.Lemm v.	 Mitchell, [1912] A.C. 400, distinguished,761Held,  further,	 that the notices issued by  the  Income-taxOfficer on August 8, 1948, and the assessments based on themwere invalid.Venkatachalam  v.  Bombay Dyeing & Mfg.	 Co.,  Ltd.,  [1959]S.C.R. 703, applied.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 650 of 1957.Appeal	from the judgment dated July 13, 1956, of the  PatnaHigh Court in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 665 of 1954.R. Ganapathy Iyer and R. H. Dhebar, for the appellant.A.   V.	 Viswanatha  Sastri  and  R.  C.  Prasad,  for	 therespondent.1960.  November 29.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH,  J.-This is an appeal by the  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax with a certificate against the judgment and orderof  the High Court at Patna answering two questions  of	 lawreferred  to it under s. 66(1) of the Income-tax Act by	 theTribunal, in the negative.  Those questions were:"(1)  Whether  in the circumstances of the  case  assessmentproceedings were validly initiated under s. 34 of the IndianIncome-tax Act?(2)  If	 so, whether in the circumstances of  the  case	 theamount	received  from interest on arrears  of	agriculturalrent was rightly included in the income of the assessee ?"The  assessee, the Maharaja Pratapsingh Bahadur of  Gidhaur,had  agricultural  income from his zamindari  for  the	fourassessment  years  1944-45  to 1947-48.	  In  assessing	 hisincome to income-tax, the authorities did not include in hisassessable  income  interest received by him on	 arrears  ofrent.  This was presumably so in view of the decision of thePatna High Court.  When the Privy Council reversed the	viewof  law	 taken by the Patna High Court	in  Commissioner  ofIncome-tax  v.	Kamakhya Narayan Singh (1),  the  Income-taxOfficer issued notices under S. 34 of the(1)  [1948] 16 I.T.R. 325.762Indian	Income-tax  Act for assessing  the  escaped  income.These	notices	 were  issued  on  August  8,	1948.	 Theassessments after the returns were filed, were completed  onAugust	26,  1948.   Before the	 notices  were	issued,	 theIncome-tax  Officer  had  not put  the	 matter	 before	 theCommissioner for his approval, as  the section then did	 notrequire	 it,  and the assessments were	completed  on  thosenotices.   Section  34	was amended by	the  Income-tax	 andBusiness Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948 (No. 48 of 1948),which  received the assent of the Governor-General  on	Sep-tember	8,  1948.  The appeals filed by	 the  assessee	weredisposed  of on September 14 and 15, 1951, by the  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner, before whom no question as  regardsthe  validity  of the notices under s. 34 was  raised.	 Thequestion of the validity of the notices without the approvalof  the Commissioner appears to have been raised before	 theTribunal for the first time.  In that appeal, the AccountantMember	and the Judicial Member differed, one  holding	thatthe  notices  were invalid and the other, to  the  contrary.The  President agreed with the Accountant 'Member  that	 thenotices were invalid, and the assessments were ordered to beset aside.The Tribunal then stated a case and raised and referred	 thetwo questions, which have been quoted above.  The High Courtagreed with the conclusions of the majority, and the presentappeal	has been filed on a certificate granted by the	HighCourt.Section 34, as it stood prior to the amendment Act No. 48 of1948,  did not lay any duty upon the Income-tax	 Officer  toseek  the  approval  of the Commissioner  before  issuing  anotice	under s. 34.  The amending Act by its first  sectionmade  ss.  3  to 12 of the  amending  Act  retrospective  byproviding  "sections  3 to 12 shall be deemed to  have	comeinto force on the 30th day of March, 1948........ Section  8of the amending Act substituted a new section in place of s.34, and in addition to textual changes with which we are notconcerned, also added a proviso to the followingeffect :"Provided that-763(1)  the  Income-tax Officer shall not issue a notice  underthis  sub-section  unless he has recorded  his	reasons	 fordoing  so and the Commissioner is satisfied on such  reasonsthat it is a fit case for the issue of such notice."The  question is whether the notices which were issued	wererendered  void	by  the operation  of  this  proviso.-'	 TheCommissioner contends that s. 6 of the General Clauses	Act,particularly cls. (b) and (c) saved the assessments as	wellas  the	 notices.  He relies upon a decision  of  the  PrivyCouncil in Lemm v. Mitchell (1), Eyre v. Wynn-Mackenzie	 (2)and Butcher v. Henderson (3) in support of his	proposition.The  last  two cases have no bearing upon this	matter;	 butstrong	reliance is placed upon the Privy Council case.	  Inthat case, the earlier, action which had been commenced whenthe Ordinance had abrogated the right of action for criminalconversation,  had already ended in favour of the  defendantand  no appeal therefrom was pending, and it was  held	thatthe revival of the right of action for criminal conversationdid not invest the plaintiff with a right to begin an actionagain and thus expose the defendant to a double jeopardy forthe  same act, unless the statute expressly and by  definitewords  gave him that right.  The Privy Council case is	thusentirely different.No  doubt,  under  s. 6 of the General	Clauses	 Act  it  isprovided  that	where any Act repeals  any  enactment,	thenunless	a different intention appears, the repeal shall	 notaffect	the previous operation of any enactment so  repealedor  anything  duly  done thereunder  or	 affect	 any  right,obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred  underany  enactment	so repealed.  It further provides  that	 anylegal  proceedings  may be continued or enforced as  if	 therepealing Act had not been passed.  Now, if the amending Acthad  repealed the original s. 34, and merely enacted  a	 newsection in its place, the repeal might not have affected theoperation of the original section by virtue of s. 6. But theamending Act goes further than this.  It(1) [1912] A.C. 400.		(2) (1896) 1 Ch. 135.(3) (1868) L.R. 3 Q. B. 335.764repeals	 the original s. 34, not from the day on  which	 theAct  received the assent of the Governor-General but from  astated	day,  viz., March 30, 1948, and substitutes  in	 itsplace	another	  section  containing  the   proviso   abovementioned.   The  amending Act provides	 that  the  amendingsection shall be deemed to have come into force on March 30,1948,	and  thus  by  this  retrospectivity,  indicates   adifferent intention which excludes the application of s.  6.It  is	to be noticed that the notices were  all  issued  onAugust	8, 1948, when on the statute book must be deemed  tobe  existing an enactment enjoining a duty upon the  Income-tax  Officer to obtain prior approval of  the  Commissioner,and  unless that approval was obstained, the  notices  couldnot be issued The notice were thus invalid. , The  principlewhich  was applied by this Court in Venkatachalam v.  BombayDyeing & Mfg.  Co. Ltd. (1) is equally applicable here.No question of law was raised before us, as it could not  bein view of the decision of this Court in Narayana Chetty  v.Income-tax  Officer (2), that the proviso was not  mandatoryin  character.	 Indeed,  there was time  enough  for  freshnotices to have been issued, and we fail to see why the	 oldnotices were not recalledand fresh ones issued.For these reasons, we are in agreement with the High,  Courtin the answers given, and dismiss this appeal with costs.A appeal dismissed.(1) [1959] S.C.R. 703.
