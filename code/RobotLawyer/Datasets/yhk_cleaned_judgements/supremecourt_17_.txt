Appeal	 by special leave from the judgment and order  datedNovember 18, 1957, of the Kerala High Court in O. P. No.  87of 1956.A. V. Sayed Muhammad, for the appellants.The respondents did not appear.1821960.  December 12.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH, J.-This is an appeal with the special leave ofthis Court against the judgment of the High Court of  Keraladated  November 18, 1957, passed in a petition for  writ  ofprohibition  under Art. 226 of the Constitution.  The  Stateof  Kerala and the Tahsildars of Kottayam and  KanjirappallyTaluks	are  the  appellants,  and C.M.	 Francis  &  Co.,  apartnership firm, is the first respondent, and the  partnersof the firm are the remaining respondents.The  respondents  were doing business in hill  produce	likepepper,	 ginger, betelnuts etc., and were assessed to  salestax under the Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act XI  of1125  (referred to as the Act), for the years 1950 to  1954.The  respondents  have to pay a sum of Rs.  1,01,716-4-3  astax.   In 1954, proceedings were started against them  unders. 13 of the Act, which provides that if the tax is not paidas  laid  down in that section, the whole of the  amount  orsuch part thereof as remains due, may be recovered as if  itwere  an arrears of land revenue.  It appears that the	pro-ceedings were not fruitful, and a prosecution under s. 19 ofthe Act was instituted against the partners in the Court  ofthe  First Class Magistrate, Ponkunnam.	 Respondents 2 to  5pleaded	 guilty,  and  the Magistrate  passed  an  order  onOctober 18, 1955 as follows:	      "The  sentence or other final order: A 1 to  4	      sentenced	 to pay a fine of Rs. 50/- each	 and	      in  default  to undergo S. 1.  for  one  month	      each.  A 1 to 4 admit that they failed to	 pay	      on demand by the competent authority, a sum of	      Rs.  1,01,716-4-3 due from them as  sales	 tax	      for the years 1950 to 1954.  This amount	will	      be  realised  from  A  1	to  4,	jointly	  or	      severally, individually or collectively  under	      the provisions of the Cr.P.C. for	 realisation	      of  criminal  fines,  as if  it  were  a	fine	      imposed	by  this  court	 on   each   accused	      individually  and all of them together.	Take	      steps for the realisation."Warrants  under	 s.  386 (1) (b) of  the  Code	of  CriminalProcedure were issued to the Collector of Kottayam  Districtfor recovery of the arrears of sales tax.183The authorities, however, started proceedings again under s.13  of the Act read with the provisions of  the	 Travancore-Cochin Revenue Recovery Act, 1951 (VII of 1951), to  recoverthe  amount  as arrears of land revenue, and  attached	someproperties   belonging	 to  the  respondents	within	 thejurisdiction  of  the  second  and  third  appellants,	 theTahsildars  of Kottayam and Kanjirappally Taluks.  The	firmthereupon   filed  the	petition  under	 Art.  226  of	 theConstitution  for  a writ of prohibition or other  order  ordirection to the effect that the proceedings for realisationof  the arrears under the Revenue Recovery Act	be  quashed.In the petition, the respondents urged that inasmuch as theywere  prosecuted under s. 19 of the Act and  the  Magistratehad issued warrants, the procedure for recovery under s.  13was not available.  They contended that under s. 386 of	 theCode of Criminal Procedure the warrant is to be deemed to bea  decree and has to be executed according to civil  processapplicable  to	the execution of decrees under the  Code  ofCivil  Procedure.   They,  therefore,  submitted  that	 theprocedure  under  s. 19 of the Act was no longer  open,	 andcould not be proceeded with.Section	 19 of the Act, so far as it is material,  reads  asfollows:	      "Any person who........................	      (b)   fails  to pay within the  time  allowed,	      any tax	      assessed on him  under this Act, or	      (d)fraudulently  evades the payment of  any	      tax assessed on him..........	       shall  on conviction by a Magistrate  of	 the	      first  class, be	liable to a fine  which	 may	      extend to one thousand rupees and in the	case	      of  a  conviction under clause  (b),  (d)	 the	      Magistrate shall specify in the order the	 tax	      which  the  person  convicted  has  failed  or	      evaded  to pay and the tax so specified  shall	      be recoverable as if it were a fine under	 the	      Code  of Criminal Procedure for the  timebeing	      in force."In dealing with the question, the learned Judges of the HighCourt felt that s. 13 of the Act was in the184nature	of a general law, over which the  special  procedureprescribed by s. 19 of the Act read with s. 386 of the	Codeof  Criminal  Procedure	 was  to  prevail.   They,  however,thought that, since all the processes available under s.  19of  the Act were also available under s. 386 of the Code  ofCriminal  Procedure,  it was not necessary  to	decide	whatwould  happen  if  the	proceedings under  s.  386  came  tonothing.   They	 observed that if the question	arose,	theywould  consider it.  The writ of prohibition was granted  bythe High Court.The respondents did not appear in this Court.  We have heardlearned	 counsel  for  the appellants,	who  has  drawn	 ourattention  to all the relevant provisions of the  law.	 Thequestion  which	 arises is whether s. 19 must  be  taken  toprevail	 over s. 13 of the Act.	 Both the sections lay	downthe mode for recovery of arrears of tax, and, as has alreadybeen  noticed by the High Court, lead to the application  ofthe  process for recovery by attachment and sale of  movableand  immovable properties, belonging to the tax-evader.	  Itcannot be said that one proceeding is more general than	 theother, because there is much that is common between them, inso far as the mode of recovery is concerned.  Section 19, inaddition  to recovery of the amount, gives the power to	 theMagistrate  to convict and sentence the offender to fine  orin  default  of payment of fine, to  imprisonment.   In	 ouropinion, neither of the remedies for recovery is destructiveof the other, because if two remedies are open, both can  beresorted to, at the option of the authorities recovering theamount.	 It was observed by Mahmood, J. in Shankar Sahai  v.Din  Dial  (1)	that  where the law  provides  two  or	moreremedies,  there is no reason to think that one	 debars	 theother  and therefore both must be understood to remain	opento him, who claims a remedy.  Unless the statute in  expresswords or by necessary implication laid down that one  remedywas  to	 the  exclusion of the other,  the  observations  ofMahmood, J. quoted above must apply.  In our opinion, in theabsence of any such provision in the(1)  I.L.R. (1889) 12 All- 409 (F.B.), 418.185Act,,  both the remedies were open to the  authorities,	 andthey could resort to any one of them at their option.The  appeal is allowed, and the judgment of the	 High  Courtset  aside.  Though the respondents did not appear,  in	 thecircumstances  of the case we think we should make an  orderthat  the costs shall be paid by them both here and  in	 theHigh Court.Appeal allowed.
