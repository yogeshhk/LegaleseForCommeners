In the meantime  on	 March	~I8,1952, the appellant 1 dismissed(1)  I.L.R. 1947 All.  155.735one  of	 its workmen.  The two appellants and  three  otherswere prosecuted under s. 31 Of the Industrial Disputes	Act,1947, for a breach of s. 33 for dismissing a workman  duringthe   pendency	 of  the  conciliation	 proceedings.	 Theappellants contended that since s. 12(6) required the reportof  the conciliation proceedings to be submitted  within  14days  of  the  commencement  thereof,  the  proceedings	 hadterminated  on the expiry of the 14 days and  the  dismissalwas, therefore, not during the pendency of the	conciliationproceedings.Held  that, in cases where no settlement was arrived at	 theconciliation  proceedings terminated when the report of	 theConciliation   Officer	was  received  by  the	 appropriateGovernment  and	 not  on  the expiry of	 14  days  from	 thecommencement  of  the  proceedings.   The  commencement	 andtermination  of conciliation proceedings were determined  byS. 20 and not by s. 12(6).  The dismissal of the workman wasduring the pendency of the conciliation proceedings and	 theappellants were guilty under s. 31(1) of the Act.Workers	 of the Industry Colliery, Dhanbad v.

HardayalHardy, for the appellants.H. J. Umrigar and B. H. Dhebar, for the respondent.1959.  April 21.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered byKAPUR,	J.-This	 is an appeal by special leave	against	 thejudgment and order of the High Court of Bombay reversing thejudgment  of  the Chief Presidency Magistrate,	Bombay,	 andthus convicting accused Nos. 1 & 5 under s. 31(1) read	withs.  33(1)  of  the Industrial Disputes	Act  (XIV  of  1947)(hereinafter called the Act) and sentencing accused No. 1 toa fine of Rs. 250 and accused No. 5 to a fine of Rs. 50,736The  appellants are the Andheri Marol Kurla Bus Service	 whowas  accused No. 1 (now appellant No. 1) and its Manager  H.M.  Khan who was accused No. 5 (now appellant No. 2).	Somedisputes arose between the appellant No. 1 and its  workmen.On December 13, 1951, the Conciliation Officer wrote to	 theappellant No. I and enclosed the demands of the Union  whichwere  dated  August  9, 1951.  On  December  31,  1951,	 theappellant No. I was asked to appear before the	ConciliationOfficer	  on  January  9,  1952,  and  after   getting	 oneadjournment   the  appellant  No.  I  appeared	before	 theConciliation  Officer  on January 17, 1952,  and  filed	 itsWritten	 Statement and raised various objections.  The	nextdate  of hearing was January 31, 1952, and  the	 proceedingswent on till June 2, 1952, when the appellant No. 1 wrote tothe Conciliation Officer saying that no useful purpose wouldbe served by holding any further meetings.  On May 9,  1952,the  Union  had also indicated to the  Conciliation  Officerthat  the negotiations had failed.  On March 18,  1952,	 theappellant  dismissed  Louis  Pereira, a	 bus  conductor	 andproceedings   were  taken  on  a  complaint   by   AssistantCommissioner  of Labour under s. 33 read with s. 31  of	 theAct  against  5 accused persons the two appellants  and	 thepartners of appellant No. 1. The Chief Presidency Magistrateacquitted all the accused including the appellants and	heldthat  as  the conciliation proceedings had continued  for  aperiod	of  more  than 14 days as  from	 January  17,  1952,further	 proceedings  for  conciliation	 were  illegal	 andtherefore  the accused persons could not be convicted  unders.  31(1)of the Act.  The State took an appeal to  the	HighCourt and the judgment of acquittal was reversed and of	 theaccused	 persons the two appellants were convicted  and	 theothers were acquitted.	The two appellants have appealed  byspecial leave.The  question  for  decision  is  whether  the	conciliationproceedings  could be said to be pending when Louis  Pereirawas dismissed.	If the answer is in the affirmative then theappellants  have  been	properly convicted and	if  not	 theconviction  must  be  set aside.  Section  31(1)  makes	 thecontravention of the provision737of s. 33 of the Act an offence punishable with	imprisonmentfor a period which may extend to six months or with fine  orwith both.  Section 33(1) pro- K. vides:S.   33(1)  "  During  the  pendency  of  any	conciliationproceedings  before a conciliation officer or a Board or  ofany proceeding before a Labour Court or Tribunal or NationalTribunal  in respect of an industrial dispute,	no  employershall:-(a)  in	 regard	 to any matter connected with  the  dispute,alter  to  the prejudice of the workmen	 concerned  in	suchdispute,  the  conditions  of  service	applicable  to	themimmediately before the commencement of such proceedings; or(b)  for   any	misconduct  connected  with   the   dispute,discharge or punish, whether by dismissal or otherwise,	 anyworkmen concerned in such dispute,save with the express permission in writing of the authoritybefore which the proceeding is pending ".Therefore the question reduces itself to the meaning of	 thewords  " pendency of any conciliation proceedings  before  aconciliation officer ".The  argument raised on behalf of the appellant is that	 theobject	of  conciliation is to get a  settlement  made	withexpedition  and	 therefore  under  s.  12  the	ConciliationOfficer	 was bound to make his report within 14 days of	 thecommencement of the conciliation proceedings or within	suchshorter	 period fixed by the appropriate  Government.	Fromthis  it  was submitted that as 14 days had  expired  beforeMarch  18, 1952, the dismissal could not be said to  be	 onewithin	the words " pendency of conciliation proceedings  ".The   Act  provides  for  commencement	and  conclusion	  ofconciliation  proceedings  under s. 20 but  the	 first	sub-section of s. 20 deals with what are called utility servicesand  sub-s.  2	of  that section provides  as  to  when	 theconciliation  proceedings conclude.  That sub-section is  asfollows:-S. 20(1)....................................................(2)  A	conciliation  proceeding shall	be  deemed  to	haveconcluded-93738(a)  where a settlement is arrived at, when a memorandum  ofthe settlement is signed by the par ties to the dispute;(b)  where  no settlement is arrived at, when the report  ofthe  conciliation  officer is received	by  the	 appropriateGovernment  or	when the report of the	Board  is  publishedunder s, 17, as the case may be; or(c)  when  a reference is  made to a  Court,  Labour  Court,Tribunal  or National Tribunal under section 10	 during	 thependency of conciliation proceedings ".The  provisions of sub-section 2 apply to  all	conciliationproceedings  whether  in  regard  to  utility  services	  orotherwise.   All  conciliation proceedings under  this	sub-section shall be deemed to have concluded in the case  whereno   settlement	  is  reached,	when  the  report   of	 theConciliation   Officer	is  received  by   the	 appropriateGovernment.   The conciliation proceedings therefore do	 notend  when  the	report	under  s.  12(-6)  is  made  by	 theConciliation Officer but when that report is received by theappropriate   Government.    It	 was  contended	  that	 theconciliation  proceedings should be held to  terminate	whenthe  Conciliation Officer is required under s. 12(6) of	 theAct to submit his report but the provisions of the Act abovequoted do not support this contention as the termination  ofthe  conciliation proceedings is deemed to take	 place	whenthe report is received by the appropriate Government.	Thisis  how	 s.  20(2)(b)  was interpreted	in  Workers  of	 theIndustry  Colliery,  Dhanbad v. Management of  the  IndustryColliery (1).It  was	 next  contended that  on  this	 interpretation	 theconciliation proceedings could be prolonged much beyond whatwas contemplated by the Act and the termination would dependupon  how  soon	 a report is  received	by  the	 appropriateGovernment.    It  is  true  that  s.  12(6)  of   the	 Actcontemplates   the   submission	 of  the   report   by	 theConciliation Officer within 14 days but that does not affectthe pendency of the conciliation proceedings and if for somereason the Conciliation Officer delays the submission of hisreport his action(1)  [1953] S.C.R. 428.739may   be  reprehensible	 but  that  will  not	affect	 theinterpretation to be put on s. 20(2)(b) of the Act.  Section12 lays down the duties of the Conciliation_ officer.  He isrequired  to bring about settlement between the parties	 andmust  begin  his  investigation	 without  delay	 and  if  nosettlement is arrived at he is to  submit his report to	 theappropriate  Government.  No doubt s. 12  contemplates	thatthe report should be made and the proceedings closed  withina  fortnight  and  if proceedings are  not  closed  but	 arecarried	 on,  as they were in the present case,	 or  if	 theConciliation Officer does not make his report within 14 dayshe  may	 be  guilty  of a breach of  duty  but	in  law	 theproceedings   do not automatically come to an  end  after 14days  but only terminate as provided in s. 20(2)(b)  of	 theAct.  Colliery	Mazdoor Congress, Asansol v.  New  BeerbhoomCoal  Co.  Ltd (1).  As the  conciliation  proceedings	werepending	 at  the time when Louis Pereira was  dismissed	 theappellants  were rightly convicted under s. 31(1) read	withs. 33 of the Act.The appeal is therefore dismissed.Appeal dismissed.
