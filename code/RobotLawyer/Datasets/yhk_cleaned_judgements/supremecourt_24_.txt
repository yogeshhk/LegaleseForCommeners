By s.  4Of  the Act all lands in the State of  whatever	 descriptionand held under whatever tenure were to be charged and levieda uniform rate of tax to be called the basic tax.  Section 7gave power to the Government to exempt from the operation ofthe Act such78lands  or  class  of  lands which  the	Government  may,  bynotification, decide.  Section 5A which was introduced	intothe Act by the Amending Act enabled the Government to make aprovisional  assessment of the basic tax in respect  of	 thelands  which  had not been surveyed by	the  Government	 andprovided  that	the Government after conducting	 the  surveyshall  make  a	regular assessment and	make  the  necessaryadjustments  in respect of the amounts paid already.   Therewas, however, no time fixed for the conduct of the survey.The  petitioners who owned forest in the  State,  challengedthe  constitutional validity of the Act on the grounds	thatthe provisions of the Act contravened Arts. 14, 19(i)(f) and31(1)  of the Constitution of India inasmuch as (1) the	 Actdid  not have any regard to the quality of the land  or	 itsproductive capacity and the levy of a tax at a flat rate  ofRS. 2 per acre imposed very unreasonable restrictions on theright  to hold property, (2) the.  Act did not lay down	 anyprovision  calling  for a return from the  assessee  for  anenquiry	 or  investigation of facts before  the	 provisionalassessment  was	 made or any right of appeal to	 any  higherauthority  and,	 in  fact, did not make	 any  provision	 forhearing	 the assessee at any stage, (3) S. 7 gave  arbitrarypower to the Government to pick and choose in the matter  ofgrant  of total or partial exemption from the provisions  ofthe  Act,  and	(4)  the  tax  proposed	 to  be	 levied	 hadabsolutely  no	relation to the production capacity  of	 theland sought to be taxed or to the income they could  derive,and  therefore	the Act had been conceived with	 a  view  toconfiscating  private property, there being no	question  ofany compensation being paid to those who may be expropriatedas a result of the working of the Act.The  petitioners also challenged the legislative  competenceof  the legislature of the State to levy a tax on  lands  onwhich  forests	stood.	The case on behalf of the  State  ofKerala,	 inter alia, was that the Act had its  justificationin  Art.  265 Of the Constitution of India,  which  was	 notsubject	 to the provisions of Part III of  the	Constitutionand  that,  therefore,	Arts. 14, 19 and  31  could  not  bepressed in aid of the petitioners. ,Held,  (Sarkar, J., dissenting), that the  Travancore-CochinLand  Tax Act, 1955, infringed the provisions of Art. 14  Ofthe Constitution of India.The Act obliged every person who held land to pay the tax atthe flat rate prescribed, whether or not he made any  incomeout  of	 the property, or whether or not  the  property	 wascapable of yielding any income.	 Consequently, there was  noattempt	 at classification in the provisions of the Act	 andit  was one of those cases where the lack of  classificationcreated inequality.  It was therefore hit by the prohibitionto deny equality before the law contained in Art. 14.Section 5A of the Act which enabled the Government to make aprovisional assessment of the basic tax payable by the79holder of unsurveyed land imposed unreasonable	restrictionson the rights to hold property safeguarded by Art.  19(1)(f)of the Constitution, inasmuch as (1) the Act did not  imposean   obligation	 on  the  Government  to  undertake   surveyproceedings  within any prescribed or ascertainable  period,with  the  result that a landholder might  be  subjected  torepeated  annual  provisional assessments on  more  or	lessconjectural  basis and liable to pay the tax  assessed,	 and(2)  the Act being silent as to the machinery and  procedureto  be	followed  in making the assessment left	 it  to	 theExecutive,  completely ignoring the legal position that	 theassessment of a tax on a person or property was at least  ofa quasijudicial character.Section	 7 of the Act which vested the Government  with	 thepower wholly or partially to exempt any land from the provi-sions  of the Act did not lay down any principle  or  policyfor  the  guidance  of the exercise  of	 discretion  by	 theGovernment  in respect of the selection contemplated by	 thesection,  and was, therefore, discriminatory in	 effect	 andoffended  Art. 14.  The section was not severable  from	 therest  of the Act as both the charging sections, S. 4 and  S.7,  authorising the Government to grant exemptions from	 theprovisions  of	the  Act were the  main	 provisions  of	 thestatute.Shri  Ram  Krishna Dalmia v. Sri justice  S.  R.  Tendolkar,[1959] S.C.R. 279, relied on.The  Act was also confiscatory in character inasmuch as	 theprovisions  of	the Act had the effect	of  eliminating	 theprivate	 owners	 through the machinery of the  Act,  withoutproposing  to  acquire the privately owned  forests  in	 theState  after satisfying the conditions laid down in Art.  31of the Constitution.Per  Sinha, C.J., Imam, Subba Rao and Shah, JJ.-Article	 265of the Constitution which provided that the State shall	 notlevy or collect a tax except by authority of law referred toa  valid law, and in order that the law might be valid,	 thetax  proposed  to be levied must be within  the	 legislativecompetence of the Legislature imposing a tax and authorisingthe  collection	 thereof  and, secondly,  the  tax  must  besubject to the conditions laid down in Art. 13, by which alllaws  inconsistent with or in derogation of the	 fundamentalrights in Part III shall be void.Per Sarkar, J.-(1) The object of the Act was to tax land  inthe  State for raising revenues by providing for a  low	 anduniform	 rate of basic tax replacing all other dues  payableto  the	 Government  and  the  tax  payers  were  classifiedaccording  to  the  area  of lands held	 by  them.   Such  aclassification had an intelligible basis and had a  rationalrelation to the object of the Act.  As tax was to be  leviednot because the land was productive but because the land washeld in the State, the classification did not offend Art. 14Of  the	 Constitution, even though it might  impose  unequalburden of the tax on the owners of land on account of ownersof less productive land being put on a larger burden.80(2)Section 5A did not offend Art. 14 and in the absence ofexpress	 provisions laying down the procedure  according  towhich  the  provisional assessment was to be made,  the	 Actcould not be held invalid on the ground that it was  againstthe rules of natural justice.(3)Section  7, even if it were considered invalid  on  theground	that it gave arbitrary power to the  Government	 andoffended Art. 14, was severable from the rest of the Act andwould not affect the other provisions of the Act.(4)The Act did not infringe the fundamental rights in Art.19(1)(f) as the rate of tax fixed by the Act was a very	 lowrate and the restrictions on those rights were reasonable.(5)  The Act was not in its nature expropriatary and did notoffend	Art.  31.   As	there was  no  want  of	 legislativecompetence, theAct could not be assailed as a piece  ofcolourable  legislation on the ground that though in form  ataxing	statute it, in effect, was intended  to	 expropriatelands by imposing a tax too heavy for the land to bear.(6)The word "land" in Entry 49 of List II, Sch. 7, of  theConstitution, included "land on which a forest stands"	and,therefore,  under  that	 Entry taxation	 on  land  on  whichforests	  stood	 was  permissible  and	legal.	  The	Act,therefore,  could  not	be challenged as  being	 beyond	 thelegislative competence of the State Legislature.JUDGMENT:ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petitions Nos. 13 to 24, 42 and 46 to54 of 1958.Petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India	 forenforcement of Fundamental Rights.M.C.

J.-In this batch of 22 petitions under Art. 32  ofthe    Constitution,	the    petitioners    impugn	 theconstitutionality of the Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act,  XVof  1955,  as  amended by  the	Travancore-Cochin  Land	 Tax(Amendment)  Act,  X  of 1957,	which  hereinafter  will  bereferred to as the Act.	 The Act came into force on June 21,1955,  and  the	 Amending  Act	on  August  6,	1957.	 Thepetitioners  are owners of forest areas in certain parts  ofthe  State  of Kerala, which, before the  reorganisation  ofStates, formed part of the State of Madras.  The respondentsto  the petitions are: (1) the State of Kerala and  (2)	 theDistrict Collector, Palghat:These petitions are based on allegations, which are, more orless,  similar, and the following allegations made  in	WritPetition  No.  42  of 1958 may be taken as  typical  and  anextreme case, which was placed before us in detail to  bringinto  bold  relief the full significance and effect  of	 thelegislation  impugned  in these cases.	 The  petitioner  inPetition 42 of 1958 is a citizen of India, who owns  forestsin certain parts of Palghat Taluk in Palghat District, whichwas part of the State of Madras before the reorganisation ofStates.	  These forests are now in the State of Kerala.	  Upto the time that these forests were in the State of  Madras,as  it then was, the Madras Preservation of Private  ForestsAct, Madras Act XXVII of 1949, governed these forests.	Evenafter  these areas were transferred to the State of  Kerala,the  said Madras Act, XXVII of 1949, continued to  apply  tothese  forests.	  Under the said Madras Act  the  owners  offorests,  like	the petitioner, could  not  sell,  mortgage,lease  or  otherwise alienate any portion of  their  forestswithout the previous sanction of the District Collector; norcould they, without similar permission, cut trees or do	 anyact likely to denude the forest or diminish its utility,  assuch.	The  District Collector, in exercise of	 the  powersunder  the  Act, does not ordinarily permit the	 cutting  ofmore than a small82number of trees in the forest.	Thus the petitioner has	 notthe  right fully to exploit the forest wealth in his  forestarea  and has to depend upon the previous permission of	 theCollector.  In exercise of the powers given to the Collectorunder the Madras Act aforesaid, the petitioner's lessee	 wasgiven  permission to cut certain trees in his forest,  whichbrings to the petitioner by way of income from. the  forest,a  sum of Rs. 3,100 per year.  Under the Act, a	 tax  calledland  tax at a flat rate of Rs. 2 per acre has been  imposedon  the petitioner.  In pursuance of the provisions  of	 theAct,  as  amended as aforesaid, the  District  Collector  ofPalghat, purporting to act under the provisions of s. 5A  ofthe  Act,  issued a notice to the  petitioner  provisionallyassessing  the petitioner's forest under the said Act  to  asum  of	 fifty thousand rupees per annum and  informing	 thepetitioner that, if no representation was made within thirtydays, the said provisional assessment would be confirmed anda  demand  notice  would be issued.  As there  has  been  nosurvey	of  the	 area of forest	 land  in  the	petitioner'spossession, the District Collector has conjectured the	saidarea  to be twenty-five thousand acres.	 The Petitioner	 hadmade  an  application to the District  Collector  under	 theMadras Preservation of Private Forests Act for felling treesin  an	area of one thousand acres, but	 the  Collector	 waspleased to grant permission to out trees from 450 acres onlyin the course of five years at the rate of 90 acres a  year.The petitioner has leased out that right to another  person,who  made  the	highest bid of Rs. 3,100 per  year,  as	 thelandlord's  fee for the right to cut and remove	 the  trees,and other minor produce.  Besides the demand aforesaid,	 therevenue	 authorities have levied about four thousand  rupeesas  tax	 on  the  surveyed  portions  of  the  forest.	 Thepetitioner's  forest has large areas of and rocks,  rivuletsand   gorges.	The  petitioner,  in  those   circumstances,questions  the	constitutional	validity  of  the  Act,	 theprovisions of which will be examined hereinafter.These  petitions  have been opposed on behalf of  the  firstrespondent and the allegations and submissions83made  in  the petitions are sought to be controverted  by  acounter affidavit sworn to by an Assistant Secretary of	 the Kerala  Government  in the Revenue Department.   It	is  insimilar terms, as a matter of fact printed in most of  thesecases.	It is contended therein on behalf of the  respondentthat  the  petitions are not maintainable in as much  as  nofundamental  rights of the petitioners have been  infringed;that the allegations about the income, from the forest lands are  not admitted; and by way of submission, it  is	added,they are irrelevant for the purposes of these petitions.  Itis  stated that the Act was passed with a view	to  unifyingthe system of land tax in the whole of the State of  Kerala.It  is	submitted  that the validity of the Act	 has  to  bedetermined in the light of Art. 265 of the Constitution	 andthat  Arts.  19 and 31 were wholly out of the  way.   It  isdenied	that the tax imposed was harsh or arbitrary, or	 hasthe  effect of violating the petitioner's right	 of  holdingproperty;  and	it  was asserted  that	the  allegations  inrespect of income from the forests are entirely	 irrelevant,as  the tax was not a tax on income, but was an	 "impost  onland".	 It  is	 equally  irrelevant  whether  the  land  isproductive  or not.  It is also contended that, in  view  ofthe provisions of Art. 31(5)(b)(i) of the Constitution, Art.31(2)  could  not be relied upon by  the  petitioners.	 Theallegation  of the petitioners that the Act is a  device  toconfiscate private forests is denied.  It is admitted  that,except	in certain cases, the entire area is unsurveyed	 andthat steps are being taken for surveying those areas.  It isalso  stated that the areas shown in the notices  served  onthe  petitioners are based on information available  to	 theCollector  of  the District; and lastly, it is	stated	thatonly notice has been issued calling upon the petitioners  tomake   their  representations,	if  any,  to  the   proposedprovisional assessments.  The assessments have not yet	beenmade, and, therefore, there is no question of demand of	 taxbeing  enforced	 by  coercive  processes.   Finally,  it  issuggested  that the Act has been enacted for the  legitimaterevenue purposes of the State.Before entering upon a discussion of the points in84controversy,  it  is convenient at this	 stage	to  indicatebriefly the relevant provisions of the Act which is impugnedby  the	 petitioners as ultra vires the	 State	Legislature.The preamble of the Act is in these terms:-	      "Whereas it is deemed necessary to provide for	      the  levy of a low and uniform rate  of  basic	      tax  on all lands in the State of	 Travancore-	      Cochin."Basic  tax  has been defined as "the tax imposed  under	 theprovisions  of	this  Act".  Section 3 lays  down  that	 thearrangement made under the Act for the levy of the basic taxshall  be  deemed  inter  alia	to  be	a  general   revenuesettlement  of	the State, notwithstanding anything  in	 anystatute, grant, deed or other transaction subject to certainprovisos  not  material	 for  our  present  purposes.	 Thecharging section is s. 4, which is in these terms:-	      "Subject to the provisions of this Act,  there	      shall be charged and levied in respect of	 all	      lands  in the State, of  whatever	 description	      and held under whatever tenure, a uniform rate	      of tax to be called the basic tax."Section	 5  lays  down the rate of the	tax  which,  by	 theAmendment,  has been raised to Rs. 2 per acre (two pies	 percent.  of  land	 per annum) and the basic  tax	charged	 andlevied	at  that  rate	shall be  the  tax  payable  to	 theGovernment  in lieu of any existing tax in respect of  land.Section 6 lays down that any stipulation in any contract  oragreement or lease or other transaction to pay land  revenueassessment of any land shall be construed as stipulation forthe  payment  of the amount. of basic tax,  as	charged	 andlevied under the Act.  Section 7 is in these terms:-	      "This  Act is not applicable to lands held  or	      leased by the Government or any land or  class	      of   lands  which	 the  Government   may,	  by	      notification in the Gazette, either wholly  or	      partially	 exempt from the provisions of	this	      Act."Sections  8  and  9  provide  for  the	continuance  of	 theliability to pay certain dues in respect of existing tenuresin addition to the basic tax in respect of lands covered  bythose tenures.	Section 10 abolishes the85irrigation assessment charged on certain tank beds and otherwater  reservoirs  named and described therein.	 Section  11preserves  the	right  of the  Government  to  levy  certainirrigation and water cesses and lays down that the Act shallnot  affect the power of the Government to levy any rate  oralter  any existing rate of irrigation or water cess on	 anyland, as they deem fit.	 Cesses, other than those  mentionedin  s.	11,  are  also	abolished  by  s.  12.	 Section  13authorises  the Government to appoint such officers as	theydeem necessary for the purpose of the Act.  Section 14	laysdown  the bar of suits against the Government in respect  ofanything done or any order passed under the Act.  Section 15saves the right of the Government which accrued to it beforethe  Act  came	into force as also  the	 conditions  of	 anyagreement. grant or deed relating to any land, except to theextent	 indicated  in	the  Act.   Section  16	 vests	 theGovernment  with the power to make rules for  carrying	intoeffect the provisions of the Act, with particular  referenceto  the	 power to make rules for the  apportionment  of	 thebasic tax charged on certain kinds of holdings, for definingthe  powers and duties of the officers appointed  under	 theAct  and  for determining the kist instalments and  the	 duedate  for  the	payment thereof.  These	 in  short  are	 theprovisions  of	the Act.  The Act, as indicated	 above,	 wasamended by Act X of 1957 which substituted the words  "Stateof  Kerala" for the words "State of Travancore-Cochin"	andmade certain other consequential changes.  The Amending	 Actintroduced section 5A, which has been very much assailed  inthe  course of the argument before us and it is,  therefore,necessary to set it out in full.  It is in these terms:-	      "S.  5A.	Provisional assessment of basic	 tax	      in the case of unsurveyed land8.-(1) It  shall	      be  competent  for the Government	 to  make  a	      provisional   assessment	of  the	 basic	 tax	      payable  by a person in respect of  the  lands	      held  by him and which have not been  surveyed	      by  the Government, and upon  such  assessment	      such person shall be liable to pay the  amount	      covered in the provisional assessment.	      86	      (2)The Government after conducting a survey	      of  the lands referred to in  sub-section	 (1)	      shall  make a regular assessment of the  basic	      tax payable in respect of such lands.  After a	      regular  assessment has been made, any  amount	      paid  towards the provisional assessment	made	      under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to	have	      been  paid towards the regular assessment	 and	      when  the amount paid towards the	 provisional	      assessment  exceeds, the amount payable  under	      the  regular assessment, the excess  shall  be	      refunded to the person assessed."By s. 9, s. 3 of the Madras Revenue Recovery Act, 1864,	 hasbeen substituted in these terms:	      "3.  Landholder when and to whom to pay kist.-	      Every landholder shall pay to the Collector or	      other officer empowered by 'him in this behalf	      the land tax due from him on or before the day	      fixed for payment under the rules framed under	      s. 16 of the Land Tax Act, 1955."From  a review of the provisions of the Act, as	 amended  asaforesaid,  it will be clear that the provisions of the	 Actlay  down in barest outline the policy to impose  a  uniformand,  what is asserted to be, a low rate of land tax on	 alllands in the State of Kerala.  Unlike other taxing statutes,it  does not make any provision for issue of notice  to	 theassessee,  nor	is there any provision for submission  of  areturn	by  the	 assessee.   By s.  5A,	 it  authorises	 theGovernment to make a "provisional assessment" in respect  ofland,  which  has not been surveyed,  and  such	 provisionalassessment  is made payable by the person made liable  underthe Act.  It does not make any provision for any appeals  incases  where  the assessee may feel  dissatisfied  with	 theassessment.   The  Act	does contemplate the  making  of  "aregular	 assessment  of	 the basic tax".  But  it  does	 notindicate  as to when the regular assessment would  be  made,except	indicating that it can be made only after  a  surveyhas  been  made in respect of the land	assessed.   The	 Actcould  not  have  been cast in more general  terms  and	 theproceedings under the Act could not have been more  summary.It  has	 thus the merit of brevity as  also  of	 simplicity,derived87from  the fact that a tax is levied at a flat  rate,  irres-pective	 of the quality of the land and consequently of	 itsproductive  capacity.  Under the Act, the charge has  to  belevied, whether or not any income has been derived from	 theland.  The Legislature was so much in earnest about  levyingand  realising	the tax that it could not even	wait  for  aregular	 survey of the lands to be assessed with a  view  todetermining the extent and character of the land.Such are the provisions and the effect of the Act, which hasbeen  assailed	on  a number of grounds	 on  behalf  of	 thepetitioners.   It is contended, in the first instance,	thatinequality is writ large in the provisions of the Act, whichis  clearly discriminatory in character and effect and	thusinfringes Art. 14 of the Constitution.	As the Act does	 nothave any regard to the quality of the land or its productivecapacity,  and	a tax at a flat rate of Rs. 2  per  acre  isproposed  to  be  levied  under	 the  Act,  it	is   furthercontended, it imposes very unreasonable restrictions on	 theright to hold property and is thus an invasion on the rightsguaranteed  to	the petitioners under Art. 19(1)(f)  of	 theConstitution.	The  Act  does not lay	down  any  provisioncalling	 for a return from the assessee, for any enquiry  orinvestigation of facts before the provisional assessment  ismade or for any right of appeal to any higher authority fromthe  order of provisional assessment; in fact, there  is  noprovision for hearing the assessee at any stage.  The Act isof  an arbitrary character and is thus wholly  repugnant  tothe guaranteed rights of the petitioners.  Section 7  quotedabove  gives uncanalised, unlimited and arbitrary  power  tothe Government to pick and choose in the matter of grant  oftotal  or partial exemption from the provisions of the	Act.It  also  suffers from the vice of discrimination.   It	 hasalso been vehemently argued that the Act, though it purportsto be a tax on land, is really a law relating to forests  inpossession of the petitioners and would not come within	 thepurview	 of entry 18 read by itself or in  conjunction	withentry  45 of List II, but is law relating to  forests  underentry 19.  If we tear the veil in which the real88purpose and effect of the Act has been shrouded, 'it will  Iappear that the true character and effect of the Act is	 notto levy a tax on land, but to expropriate the private ownersof   the  forests  without  payment  of	 any	compensationwhatsoever.   Lastly, it has been urged that the  whole	 Acthas  been  conceived  with a view  to  confiscating  privateproperty, there being no question of any compensation  beingpaid  to those who may be expropriated as a result  of	the,working	 of  the Act.  This last argument is  based  on	 theassertion  that	 the tax proposed to be	 levied	 on  privateproperty  in the State of Kerala has absolutely no  relationto  the paying capacity of the persons sought to  be  taxed,with reference to the income they could derive, or  actuallydid derive from the property.On  behalf  of the State of Kerala,  the  learned  Advocate-General	 has argued that, though in most of the cases,	thatis to say, except in seven petitions (Petitions 21, 22,	 47,49,  50,  51 and 54) the lands have not been  surveyed,	 theareas	mentioned  in  the  notices  proposing	 provisionalassessment have been ascertained through the local  agenciesof the Government.  It was further contended that the  Statehad only declared the liability to the payment of the tax ata  flat	 rate  of  Rs.	2  per	acre  in  respect  of  land,irrespective  of the income to be derived therefrom.   Hencethere  was no necessity for making provision for a  detailedenquiry or investigation.  The rate of the tax being  known,and  the  area of the land to be taxed having  been  locallyascertained,  even though without any regular  survey,	whatremained  was  merely quantifying the tax, which  was  of  apurely	 administrative	 character.   The   local   agenciesestimated  the	land in possession  of	particular  persons.Those  persons were called upon to pay provisionally at	 therate  fixed  by the statute.  The State	 has,  by  executiveaction,	 appointed  authorities who are expected to  act  inaccordance  with  the principle of natural  justice.   Therewas,  therefore,  no  need for	laying	down  any  elaborateprocedure  as in other instances of taxing statutes.   Thereis  a  presumption  that  the  authority  appointed  by	 theGovernment would act bona fide and in a			     89proper	 manner.  If there was any case of unfair  dealings,the  matter could be brought to the Court.  It	was  greatlyemphasised  that  as  a	 flat  rate  of	 taxation  had	beenenvisaged by the Act and as ultimately the tax at that	ratewould  be  realised from land found to be in  possession  ofparticular  persons  after  a regular  survey,	the  regularsurvey	to be ultimately made would automatically  determinethe amount of tax to be paid and the adjustment of the taxesalready	 paid  could be made on that basis.   On  the  legalaspect	 of  the  controversy  raised  on  behalf   of	 thepetitioners,   it   was	 argued	 that  the   Act   has	 itsjustification in Art. 265 of the Constitution, which was notsubject	 to the provisions of Part III of  the	Constitutionand  that, therefore, Arts. 14, 19, 31 could not be  pressedin aid of the petitioners.  It was also contended that	evenif  the	 Act  is,  in effect,  confiscatory,  it  cannot  bequestioned,  being a taxing statute.  Finally, it was  urgedthat  the  question of the amount of income derived  by	 thepetitioners  from the property sought to be taxed is  whollyirrelevant,  because the Act was not a tax on income but  itwas a tax on the property itself.The most important question that arises for consideration inthese  cases,  in view of the stand taken by  the  State  ofKerala,	 is  whether  Art.  265 of  the	 Constitution  is  acomplete answer to the attack against the  constitutionalityof  the	 Act.  It is, therefore, necessary to  consider	 thescope  and  effect of that Article.  Article 265  imposes  alimitation on the taxing power of the State in so far as  itprovides  that	the State shall not levy or collect  a	tax,except by authority of law, that is to say, a tax cannot  belevied or collected by a mere executive fiat.  It has to  bedone  by  authority of law, which must mean valid  law.	  Inorder  that  the law may be valid, the tax  proposed  to  belevied	must  be within the legislative	 competence  of	 theLegislature  imposing a tax and authorising  the  collectionthereof	 and,  secondly,  the tax must	be  subject  to	 theconditions laid down in Art. 13 of the Constitution.  One ofsuch  conditions  envisaged  by	 Art.  13(2)  is  that	 theLegislature shall not make any law which90takes away or abridges the equality clause in Art. 14, whichenjoins the State not to deny to any person equality  beforethe law or the equal protection of the laws of the  country.It  cannot  be	disputed that if  the	 Act  infringes	 theprovisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution, it must be struckdown  as unconstitutional.  For the purpose of these  cases,we shall assume that the State Legislature had the necessarycompetence  to	enact the law, though the  petitioners	haveseriously  challenged such a competence.  The  guarantee  ofequal  protection  of the laws must extend  even  to  taxingstatutes.  It has not been contended otherwise.	 It does notmean that every person should be taxed equally.	 But it doesmean that if property of the same character has to be taxed,the  taxation  must  be by the same standard,  so  that	 theburden	of taxation may fall equally on all persons  holdingthat  kind  and	 extent	 of  property.	 If  the   taxation,generally  speaking, imposes a similar burden on  every	 onewith  reference	 to  that  particular  kind  and  extent  ofproperty,  on the same basis of taxation, the law shall	 notbe, open to attack on the ground of inequality, even  thoughthe  result of the taxation may be that the total burden  ondifferent persons may be unequal.  Hence, if the Legislaturehas   classified  persons  or  properties   into   differentcategories,  which  are	 subjected  to	different  rates  oftaxation  with	reference  to income  or  property,  such  aclassification would not be open to the attack of inequalityon  the ground that the total burden resulting from  such  aclassification	is unequal.  Similarly, different  kinds  ofproperty  may be subjected to different rates  of  taxation,but   so  long	as  there  is  a  rational  basis  for	 theclassification,	 Art.  14 will not be in the way of  such  aclassification	resulting  in unequal burdens  on  differentclasses	 of properties.	 But if the same class	of  propertysimilarly situated is subjected to an incidence of taxation,which  results in inequality, the law may be struck down  ascreating  an inequality amongst holders of the same kind  ofproperty.  It must, therefore, be held that a taxing statuteis  not	 wholly	 immune from attack on the  ground  that  itinfringes the equality clause ill91Art. 14, though the Courts are not concerned with the policyunderlying  a  taxing statute or whether  a  particular	 taxcould  not have been imposed in a different way or in a	 waythat the Court might think more just and equitable.  The Acthas, therefore, to be examined with reference to the  attackbased on Art. 14 of the Constitution.It  is common ground that the tax, assuming that the Act  isreally	a taxing statute and not a confiscatory measure,  ascontended on behalf of the petitioners, has no reference  toincome, either actual or potential, from the property soughtto be taxed.  Hence, it may be rightly remarked that the Actobliges	 every person who holds land to pay the tax  at	 theflat rate prescribed, whether or not he makes any income outof  the property, or whether or not the property is  capableof yielding any income.	 The Act, in terms, claims to be  "ageneral	  revenue   settlement	of  the	  State"   (s.	 3).Ordinarily, a tax on land or land revenue is assessed on theactual	or the potential productivity of the land sought  tobe  taxed.   In other words, the tax has  reference  to	 theincome	actually made, or which could have been	 made,	withdue diligence, and, therefore, is levied with due regard  tothe incidence of the taxation.	Under the Act in question weshall take a hypothetical case of a number of persons owningand possessing the same area of land.  One makes nothing outof the land, because it is arid desert.	 The second one doesnot  make  any	income, but could raise some  crop  after  adisproportionately  large investment of labour and  capital.A third one, in due course of husbandry, is making the	landyield  just  enough to pay for the incidental  expenses	 andlabour	charges besides land tax or revenue.  The fourth  ismaking	large profits, because the land is very fertile	 andcapable	 of  yielding  good crops.  Under  the	Act,  it  ismanifest  that	the fourth category,  in  our  illustration,would  easily  be able to bear the burden of the  tax.	 Thethird  one may be able to bear the tax.	 The first  and	 thesecond one will have to pay from their own pockets, if	theycould  afford the tax.	If they cannot afford the  tax,	 theproperty is92liable to be sold, in due process of law, for realisation ofthe public demand.  It is clear, therefore, that  inequalityis  writ  large	 on the Act and is.  inherent  in  the	veryprovisions  of	the taxing section.  It is also	 clear	thatthere  is no attempt at classification in the provisions  ofthe Act.  Hence, no more need be said as to what could	havebeen  the  basis for a valid classification.  It is  one  ofthose  cases  where  the  lack	of  classification   createsinequality.    It  is,,	 therefore,  clearly  hit   by	 theprohibition  to	 deny equality before the law  contained  inArt.  14  of the Constitution.	Furthermore, sec. 7  of	 theAct, quoted above, particularly the latter part, which veststhe Government with the power wholly or partially to  exemptany  land  from	 the  provisions  of  the  Act,	 is  clearlydiscriminatory in its effect and, therefore, infringes	Art.14  of	the  Constitution.  The Act does not  lay  down	 anyprinciple  or  policy for the guidance of  the	exercise  ofdiscretion  by	the Government in respect of  the  selectioncontemplated  by  a. 7. This Court has	examined  the  casesdecided by it with reference to the provisions of Art. 14 ofthe Constitution, in the case of Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia  v.Shri Justice S. B. Tendolkar and others (1).  S. R. Das,  C.J.,  speaking  for  the	 Court	has  deduced  a	 number	  ofpropositions  from  those decisions.  The  present  case  iswithin	the mischief of the third proposition laid  down  atpages  299  and 300 of the Report, the relevant	 portion  ofwhich is in these terms:-	      "A statute may not make any classification  of	      the  persons  or	things for  the	 purpose  of	      applying	its provisions but may leave  it  to	      the discretion of the Government to select and	      classify	 persons  or  things  to  whom	 its	      provisions  are to apply.	 In determining	 the	      question of the validity or otherwise of	such	      a	 statute the Court will not strike down	 the	      law out of hand only because no classification	      appears on its face or because a discretion is	      given to the Government to make the  selection	      or  classification but will go on	 to  examine	      and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle	or policy for the guidance of  the	      exercise	of discretion by the  Government  in	      the matter of the selection or classification.	      93	      After such scrutiny the Court will strike down	      the  statute  if	it does	 not  lay  down	 any	      principle	 or policy for guiding the  exercise	      of discretion by the Government in the  matter	      of selection or classification, on the  ground	      that  the statute provides for the  delegation	      of  arbitrary  and uncontrolled power  to	 the	      Government so as to enable it to	discriminate	      between  persons or things  similarly  situate	      and  that,  therefore, the  discrimination  is	      inherent in the statute itself" (p. 299 of the	      Report).The observations quoted above from the unanimous judgment ofthis  Court apply with full force to the provisions  of	 theAct.	It   has,   therefore,	to   be	  struck   down	  asunconstitutional.   There  is no  question  of	severabilityarising in this case, because both the charging sections, s.4  and s. 7, authorising the Government to grant  exemptionsfrom  the provisions of the Act, are the main provisions  ofthe Statute, which has to be declared unconstitutional.The  provisions of the Act are unconstitutional viewed	fromthe  angle  of	the  provisions	 of  Art.  19(1)(f)  of	 theConstitution, also.  Apart from the provisions of ss. 4	 and7 discussed above, with reference to the test under Art.  14of  the Constitution, we find that s. 5(A) is  also  equallyobjectionable  because it imposes unreasonable	restrictionson the rights to hold property, safeguarded by Art. 19(1)(f)of  the	 Constitution.	 Section  5(A)	declares  that	 theGovernment is competent to make a provisional assessment  ofthe  basic  tax payable by the holder  of  unsurveyed  land.Ordinarily,  a taxing statute lays down a regular  machineryfor  making assessment of the tax proposed to be imposed  bythe  statute.  It lays down detailed procedure as to  noticeto  the	 proposed assessee to make a return  in	 respect  ofproperty proposed to be taxed, prescribes the authority	 andthe  procedure for hearing any objections to  the  liabilityfor  taxation or as to the extent of the tax proposed to  belevied,	 and  finally,	as to the  right  to  challenge	 theregularity of assessment made, by recourse to proceedings ina   higher  Civil  Court.   The	 Act  merely  declares	 thecompetence of the Government to make94a  provisional	assessment,  and by virtue of s.  3  of	 theMadras	Revenue Recovery Act, 1864, the land-holders may  beliable	to  pay	 the tax.  The Act being silent	 as  to	 themachinery  and	procedure  to  be  followed  in	 making	 theassessment  leaves  it	to  the	 Executive  to	evolve	 therequisite  machinery and procedure.  The whole	thing,	frombeginning  to end, is treated as of a purely  administrativecharacter,  completely ignoring the legal position that	 theassessment  of a tax on person or property is at least of  aquasi-judicial character.  Again, the Act does not impose anobligation on the Government to undertake survey proceedingswithin	any  prescribed or ascertainable  period,  with	 theresult	that  a	 land-holder may be  subjected	to  repeatedannual	provisional assessments on more or less	 conjecturalbasis  and liable to pay the tax thus assessed.	 Though	 theAct was passed about five years ago, we were informed at theBar that survey proceedings had not even commenced.  The Actthus proposes to impose a liability on land-holders to pay atax  which is not to be levied on a judicial basis,  because(1) the procedure to be adopted does not require a notice tobe given to the proposed assessee; (2) there is no procedurefor  rectification  of mistakes committed by  the  AssessingAuthority;   (3)  there	 is  no	 procedure  prescribed	 forobtaining the opinion of a superior Civil Court on questionsof  law, as is generally found in all taxing  statutes,	 and(4)  no	 duty is cast upon the Assessing  Authority  to	 actjudicially in the matter of assessment proceedings.  Nor  isthere any right of appeal provided to such assessees as	 mayfeel aggrieved by the order of assessment.That  the  provisions aforesaid of the impugned Act  are  intheir  effect confiscatory is clear on their  face.   Takingthe  extreme case, the facts of which we have stated in	 theearly part of this judgment, it can be illustrated that	 theprovisions  of	the Act, without proposing  to	acquire	 theprivately  owned  forests  in  the  State  of  Kerala  aftersatisfying  the	 conditions  laid down in  Art.	 31  of	 theConstitution,  have  the effect of eliminating	the  privateowners through the machinery of the Act.  The petitioner  inpetition 4295of 1958 has been assumed to own 25 thousand acres of  forestland.  The liability under the Act would thus amount to	 Rs.50,000	a year, as already demanded from the  petitioner  onthe basis of the provisional assessment under the provisionsof s. 5(A).  The petitioner is making an income of Rs. 3,100per year out of the forests.  Besides, the liability of	 Rs.50,000 as aforesaid, the petitioner has to pay a levy of Rs.4,000  on the surveyed portions of the said forest.   Hence,his  liability	for taxation in respect of his	forest	landamounts to Rs. 54,000 whereas his annual income for the timebeing  is only Rs. 3,100 without making any  deductions	 forexpenses  of  management.   Unless the	petitioner  is	veryenamoured of the property and of the right to hold it may beassumed that he will not be in a position to pay the deficitof about Rs. 51,000 every year in respect of the forests  inhis  possession.   The legal consequences of  his  making  adefault in the payment of the aforesaid sum of money will bethat the money will be realised by the coercive processes oflaw.  One can, easily imagine that the property may be	soldat  auction  and  may  not fetch even  the  amount  for	 therealisation of which it may be proposed to be sold at publicauction.  In the absence of a bidder forthcoming to bid	 forthe offset amount, the State ordinarily becomes the  auctionpurchaser for the realisation of the outstanding taxes.	  Itis  clear, therefore, that apart from  being  discriminatoryand imposing unreasonable restrictions on holding  property,the Act is clearly confiscatory in character and effect.  Itis not even necessary to tear the veil, as was suggested  inthe course of the argument, to arrive at the conclusion thatthe  Act  has  that  unconstitutional  effect.	 For   thesereasons, as also for the reasons for which the provisions ofss.  4 and 7 have been declared to be  unconstitutional,  inview  of the provisions of Art. 14 of the Constitution,	 allthese  operative  sections of the Act, namely 4, 5A  and  7,must  be  held to offend Art. 19(1)(f) of  the	Constitutionalso.The petitions are accordingly allowed with costs against thecontesting respondent, the State of Kerala.96SARKAR,J.-  These petitions were filed under Art.32  of	 theConstitution,  challenging the validity of  the	 Travancore-Cochin Land Tax Act, 1955, as amended by Act X of 1957.	 Theprincipal Act was passed by the legislature of the State  ofTravancore-Cochin  and the Amending Act, by the	 legislatureof  the State of Kerala, in which the State  of	 Travancore-Cochin had been merged.	 The petitioners are owners of landsin  the State of Kerala.  The Act as amended  and  hereafterreferred  to as the Act, levied a certain basic tax  on	 alllands in the State of Kerala.  The petitioners say that	 thelevy is illegal and violates their fundamental rights.It  appears from the preamble that the Act was passed as  itwas  deemed necessary to provide for the levy of a  low	 anduniform	 rate of basic tax on all lands in the	State.	 TheAct provides that the arrangement made by it for the levy ofthe  basic  tax	 is to be deemed to  be	 a  general  revenuesettlement  of	the  State.  Section 4 of  the	Act  is	 thecharging  section  and	it lays down  that  there  shall  becharged and levied in respect of all lands in the State,  ofwhatever  description  and  held under	whatever  tenure,  auniform	 rate of tax to be called the basic tax.  Section  5fixes the rate of the tax at 2 n.P. per cent which works outat  Rs.	 2 per acre per annum.	This section  also  providesthat  the  basic  tax  shall  be  the  tax  payable  to	 theGovernment  in lieu of any other existing tax in respect  ofland.	Section	 12  abolishes all  cesses  on	land  exceptirrigation cess.The  first  ground  on	which the validity  of	the  Act  ischallenged is that it offends the provision as to the  equalprotection  of	the  laws  contained  in  Art.	14  of	 theConstitution.  The Act applies to all lands in the State andit  imposes an uniform rate of tax, namely, Rs. 2 per  acre.It  is	said that all lands in the State have not  the	sameproductive  quality; that some are waste lands	and  others,lands  of varying degrees of fertility.	 The  contention  isthat  the tax weighs more heavily on owners of	waste  landsthan  on  owners of fertile lands.  It is said	that  it  isbound to happen that some owners make no income out of theirlands97or  make a small income and they would have to pay  the	 taxout  of their pocket while the owners of better	 classes  oflands  yielding larger income would be able to pay  the	 taxout of the income from the lands.  It is contended that	 theAct  therefore	discriminates  between	several	 classes  ofowners	of lands in the State and is void as infringing	 theequality  clause  in the Constitution.	It may	be  concededthat  all lands in the State are not of the same  degree  offertility.  I am however unable to see that because of that,the  Act can be said to discriminate between the  owners  ofthem.What  is  really  said appears to be that the  Act  makes  aclassification	of the owners of lands according  to  areas.Assume that the Act does so.  The question then is, is	sucha  classification illegal?  The equal protection  clause  inthe  Constitution  does	 not mean that	there  shall  be  noclassification for the purpose of any law.  It has been saidby this Court in Budhan Choudhury v. The State of  Bihar(1):"It  is now well established that while article	 14  forbidsclass	legislation,   it   does   not	 forbid	  reasonableclassification	for the purposes of legislation.  In  order,however, to pass the test of permissible classification	 twoconditions   must  be  fulfilled,  namely,  (i)	  that	 theclassification	 must	be  founded   on   an	intelligibledifferential which distinguishes persons or things that	 aregrouped together from others left out of the group and	(ii)that  differential  must  have a rational  relation  to	 theobject. Bought to be achieved by the statute in question".On  the	 argument  of  the  petitioners,  the  Act  makes  aclassification	 between  owners  of  lands  using  as	 thedifferentia,  the  area	 of  the land  held  by	 them.	 Thequestion then, is, is that differentia intelligible and	 hasthat  differentia a rational relation to the object  of	 theAct?   Now it seems to me that both the tests are  satisfiedin  the	 present  case.	  The  tax  payers  are classifiedaccording to the area of lands held by them.  That is  quitean  intelligible  basis on which to make  a  classification;holders of varying areas of land can(1)  [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1045 1049.1398quite understandably be placed in different classes.Next,	has  such  a basis  of	classification,	 a  rationalrelation  to  the object of the Act?  The Act  is  a  taxingstatute.   It  is  intended  to	 collect  revenue  for	 thegovernmental business of the State.  It says that one of itsobjects	 is to provide a low and uniform rate of basic	tax.Another	 object	 mentioned  is to  replace  all	 other	duespayable to the Government in respect of the ownership of theland by a uniform basic tax.  Why is it to be said that	 theuse of the area of land held as the basis of  classificationhas  no	 rational  relation to these  objects.	 I  find  noreason.	  The  object is to tax land held in the  State	 forraising	 revenues.   It is the holding of the  land  in	 theState  that  makes the owner liable to pay  tax.   It  wouldfollow that the quantum of the tax can be reasonably  linkedwith the quantum of the holding.Why is it said that the classification on the basis of	areais bad?	 It is only because it imposes unequal burden of thetax on the owners of land; because owners of less productiveland  would have a larger burden put on them.  Now  if	thisargument  is  right, then tax on land can  be  imposed	onlyaccording  to its productivity.	 I have not been  shown	 anyauthority which goes to this length.  I am further unable tosee how productivity as the basis of classification could besaid  to  have a more rational relation to the object  of  astatute collecting revenue by taxing land held in the State.The  tax  is not levied because the land is  productive	 butbecause	 the  land is held in the State.  Again if  the	 taxwhich  could be imposed on land had to be correlated to	 itsproductivity,  then  the State would have no  power  to	 taxunproductive land and the provision in the Constitution thatit  would have power to tax land would, to that	 extent,  befutile.	 It seems to me that a contention leading to such  aresult cannot be accepted.Reliance  was placed for the petitioners on Cumberland	CoalCompany	 v.  Board  of Revision on Tax	Assessments  (1)  insupport	 of the contention that a tax on land not  based  onits productivity, violates Art. 14.(1)  76 L.Ed. 146.99I am unable to hold that this case supports the	 contention.What  had  happened  there was that a  certain	statute	 hadimposed	 a tax ad valorem on all coal situated in a  certainarea  and in assessing the tax, the coal of  the  CumberlandCoal Company had been assessed by the authorities  concernedat  its full value while the coal of the rest of  the  classliable	to  the	 tax had been assessed	at  a  lower  value.Thereupon  it  was  held that  "the  intentional  systematicundervaluation by State Officials-of taxable property of thesame  class belonging to other owners contravenes  the	con-stitutional  right  of one taxed on the full  value  of	 hisproperty."  On this view of the matter the Supreme Court  ofAmerica	 directed  readjustment	 of  the  assessments.	 Thestatute	 with which this case was concerned had	 levied	 thetax ad valorem which, it may be, is the same thing as a	 taxcorrelated to productivity.  The case had therefore  nothingto do with the question that a tax on coal otherwise than advalorem	 would be unconstitutional.  In fact this  case	 didnot declare any statute invalid.Then  it  seems	 to  me	 that  if  the	contention  of	 thepetitioners  is right, and land could be taxed only  on	 itsproductivity, for the same reason, taxes on all other thingswould have to be correlated to the income to be derived fromthem.  The result would be far reaching.  I am not  preparedto  accept  a  contention producing such  a  result  and  noauthority has been cited to lead me to accept it.It may be that as lands are not of equal productivity,	sometax  payers may be able to pay the tax out of the income  ofthe land taxed while others may have to find the money	fromanother source.	 To this extent the Act may be more hard  onsome  than on others.  But I am unable to see that for	thatreason	it is unconstitutional.	 All class legislation	putssome in a more disadvantageous position than others.  If theclassification	made by the law is good, as I think  is	 thecase  with  the present Act, the  resultant  hardship  alonecannot make it bad.  It was said in Magonn v.	  IllinoisTrust and Savings Bank(1), "It is hardly(1) 42 L.Ed. 1037, 1043.100necessary  to say that hardship, impolicy, or  injustice  ofstate  laws  is	 not  necessarily  an  objection  to   theirconstitutional validity."It  is	then  said that sub-sec. (1) of	 s.  5A,  which	 wasintroduced  into the Act by the Amending Act,  offends	Art.14.  The impugned provision is in these terms:	      S.5A.  (1) It shall be competent	for  the	      Government to make a provisional assessment of	      the  basic tax payable by a person in  respect	      of  the lands held by him and which  have	 not	      been surveyed by the Government, and upon such	      assessment such person shall be liable to	 pay	      the   amount   covered  in   the	 provisional	      assessment. This  section	was enacted as at the date of the  Act,	 alllands had not been surveyed and so the areas of all holdingswere  not known.  In the absence of such knowledge  the	 taxwhich was payable on the basis of the areas of the  holdingscould  not be assessed on unsurveyed lands, so	the  sectionprovides  that pending the survey, the Government will	havepower to make a provisional assessment on unsurveyed  lands.This provision was necessary as the survey was bound to taketime.The contention is that a. 5A(1) gives arbitrary power to theGovernment to make a provisional assessment on any person itchooses, leaving out others from the provisional assessment.I am unable to read the sub-section in that way.  It may  bethat  it leaves it to the Government to make  a	 provisionalassessment  if	it  chooses.  This does not  result  in	 anyillegal	 classification.  The surveyed lands and  unsurveyedlands  are  distinct  classes  of  properties  and  may	  bedifferently  treated.  Again, all unsurveyed lands would  onsurvey have to pay tax from the beginning.  It would  followthat  the  holders of both classes of lands  are  eventuallysubjected  to  the same burden.	 As to the  contention	thatunder this section the Government has the right to levy	 theprovisional assessment at its choice on some and not on	 allholders of unsurveyed lands, I am unable to agree that	thisis a proper reading of the section.  In my view, the101expression  "a person" in the section does not lead to	thatconclusion.  That expression should be read as "all persons"and  it	 is easily capable of being so	read.	The  sectionsays, "It shall' be competent for the' Government to make  aprovisional  assessment	 of  the  basic	 tax  payable  by  aperson".   Now	the  basic tax is  payable  by	all  personsholding	 land.	So the provisional assessment, if made,	 hasto be on all persons holding lands whose lands have not beensurveyed.   The	 Government  cannot,  therefore,  pick	 andchoose.	  A  statute  is intended to be	 legal	and  it	 hastherefore to be read in a manner which makes it legal ratherthan in a manner which makes it illegal.  If the  Governmentdid  not make the provisional assessment in the case of	 allliable	to  such assessment, then  the	Government's  actioncould  be  legitimately questioned.  It has however  not  infact  been said in these petitions that in deciding to	makethe  provisional  assessment  the Government  has  made	 anydiscrimination	 between   the	persons	  liable   to	suchassessment.Section	 5A(1)	is also attacked on the ground	that  it  isagainst	 rules	of natural justice in that it does  not	 saythat in making the provisional assessment, any hearing wouldbe given to the person sought to be assessed or requiring  areturn	from him or giving him a right of appeal in  respectof  the provisional assessment made.  It is true  that	the'section	 does  not  expressly provide for  a  hearing  beinggiven.	 It  seems to me however that if  according  to	 therules  of  natural justice the assessee was  entitled  to  ahearing,  an  assessment  made without	giving	him  such  ahearing would be bad.  The Act must be read so as to imply aprovision  requiring  compliance with the rules	 of  naturaljustice.   Such a reading is not impossible in	the  presentcase  as  there is nothing in the Act  indicating  that	 therules of natural justice need not be observed.It  was	 said in Spack man v. Plumstead Board of  Works	 (1)where  a  statute requiring an architect to give  a  certaincertificate  which did not provide the procedure as  to	 howthe   architect	 was  to  conduct  himself,  came   up	 forconsideration that, "No doubt, in the(1)  10 A.C. 229, 240.102absence of special provisions as to how the person who is todecide	is to proceed, the law will imply no more than	thatthe  substantial  requirements	of  justice  shall  not	  beviolated." Again in Maxwell on Statutes (10th ed.) p. 370 ithas  been  said,  "In  giving  judicial	 powers	 to   affectprejudicially the rights of person or property, a statute isunderstood as silently implying, when it does not  expresslyprovide, the condition or qualification that the power is tobe  exercised  in accordance with the fundamental  rules  ofjudicial  procedure,  such,  for  instance,  as	 that  whichrequires  that before its exercise, the person sought to  beprejudicially affected shall have an opportunity of  defend-ing  himself." In so far as this Act confers a power on	 theGovernment  to	discharge  the judicial	 duty  of  making  aprovisional assessment, which the petitioners say, it  does,it must imply that the judicial process has to be observed.As  regards the return, that seems to me not to be  of	muchconsequence.   If the assessee is entitled to be heard,	 thefact  that  he	is not asked to make  a	 return,  would	 notconstitute  a departure from the rules of  natural  justice.Likewise, the absence of a right of appeal is not  somethingon which the petitioners can rely.  Rules of natural justicedo not require that there must always be a right of  appeal.Under  the Act it is the Government which makes the  assess-ment  and it would not be unreasonable to hold that in	viewof  the high authority of the person assessing, the  absenceof a right of appeal is not likely to cause any	 miscarriageof  justice.   I  am therefore unable to hold  that  in	 theabsence	 of  express provisions laying	down  the  procedureaccording to which the provisional assessment is to be made,the Act has to be held invalid.It may here be stated that in those instances where, in	 thepresent	 cases, provisional assessments had been made,	the,assessees  had	either themselves supplied the area  of	 thelands  held  by them or the area had been  determined  aftergiving them a hearing.	After the area has been determine  ,the  amount  of	 the  tax payable is  decided  by  a  simplecalculation at the rate103of  Rs. 2 per acre of land held and with regard to this,  nohearing is required.Then  again  sub-see.  (2)  of	s.  5A	provides  that	 theGovernment after conducting a survey of the lands  mentionedin sub-sec. (1) under which provisional assessment is to  bemade, shall make a regular assessment and adjustments  wouldhave  to be made in regard to tax already paid on the  basisof the regular assessment.  A point is made that there is notime  limit fixed within which the regular assessment is  tobe  made and so the Act leaves it to the arbitrary  decisionof the Government when to make the regular assessment.	I donot  think that this contention is correct.  Properly  read,the  section  in the absence of any indication as  to  time,means that regular assessment would have to be made as	soonafter the survey, as is reasonably possible.It is also said that s. 7 of the Act offends Art. 14.	Thissection	 gives	power to the Government to exempt  from	 theoperation  of  the Act such lands or class of lands  as	 theGovernment  may by notification decide.	 This  section	doesnot indicate on what grounds the exemption is to be granted.It  therefore seems to me that it gives arbitrary  power  tothe  Government	 and offends Art. 14.  But  the	 section  isclearly severable from the rest of the Act.  If the  sectionis  taken out of the Act, the operation of the rest  of	 theAct will not in the least be affected.	The only effect willthen be that the Government will have no power to exempt anyland  from  the tax.  That will not in any  way	 affect	 theother provisions of the Act.  The invalidity of this sectionis therefore no reason for declaring the entire Act illegal.It  may	 be  pointed  out that it  is  not  alleged  in	 thepetitions  that	 the Government has exempted  any  lands  orclass of lands from the operation of the Act.It is contended that s. 8 of the amending Act also shows thearbitrary nature of the Act.  That section provides that  ifany difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions  ofthis  Act,  the	 Government may by  order  do  anything	 notinconsistent with such provisions which appears to it to  benecessary or expedient104for  removing  the  difficulty.	 This is a  common  form  ofprovision now found in many Acts.  The power given under  itcannot	be said to be uncontrolled for it must be  exercisedconsistently with the Act and to remove difficulties arisingin  giving effect to the Act.  In any event, this  provisionis contained in the amending Act only.	Even if the  sectionbe held to be invalid that would not affect, the rest of theamending Act or any question that arises on these petitions.The  validity  of the Act is also challenged on	 the  groundthat  it  infringes Art. 19, cl. (1), sub-cls. (f )  &	(g).This  challenge seems to me to be wholly  untenable.   Apartfrom  the  question  whether a	taxing	statute	 can  becomeinvalid	 as offending Art. 19, as to which the	position  onthe authorities does not seem to be very clear, it is  plainthat  Art. 19 permits reasonable restrictions to be  put  onthe rights mentioned in subcls. (f ) & (g).  Now there is nodispute that the rate of tax fixed by the Act is a very	 lowrate.	It  has	 not  been  said  that	the  rate  fixed  isunreasonable.	It clearly is not so.  The  restrictions  onthese rights under Art. 19(1), (f) & (g) put by the Act,  ifany, are clearly reasonable.  These rights cannot  thereforebe said to have been infringed by the Act.The  lands  of	the petitioners are  lands  on	which  standforests.   It is said that under the Madras Preservation  ofPrivate	 Forests Act, (Act XXVII of 1949), which applies  tothe  lands with which we are concerned as they are  situatedin  an	area which previously formed part of  the  State  ofMadras,	 the owners of the forests can work them  only	withthe permission of the officer mentioned in that Act.  It  issaid  that the control imposed by the officer has been	suchthat  the income received from the forest is much less	thanthe  tax  payable under the Act in respect of  the  land  onwhich  the  forest stands.  Taking by  way  of	illustrationPetition No. 13, it is pointed out that the income from	 theforest	with which that petition is concerned was Rs.  8,477for the year 1956-57 while the tax payable under the Act formore or less the same period was Rs. 1,51,000.	I am  unableto hold that because of this the Act offends Art. 19(1), (f)and (g).			    105It  is not stated that the land is not capable of  producingany  income other than the income from the forest   standingon  it.	 There is nothing to show that in all times to	comethe  income  from  the land including the  income  from	 theforest, will be less than the tax imposed on it by the	Act.The  area  of  the  land concerned in  Petition	 No.  13  isenormous  being about 75,500 acres.  I am further unable  tohold the impugned' Act to be invalid because of action	thatmay be taken under another Act, namely, the Madras Act XXVIIof 1949.The  validity  of the Act is challenged also on	 the  groundthat it offends Art. 31 of the Constitution.  I am unable tosee  any  force	 in  this contention.	If  the	 statute  isotherwise  valid, as I have found the present Act to be,  itcannot, even if it deprives any person of property, be	saidto  offend  Art. 31(1).	 It has been held by this  Court  inRamjilal  v.  Income-tax Officer,.   Mohindargarh  (1)	that"clause	 (1) of Art. 31 must be regarded as  concerned	withdeprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition  orcollection  of	tax, for otherwise Art. 265  becomes  whollyredundant." No question of cl. (2) of Art. 31 being violatedarises	here for the Act does not deal with any	 acquisitionof property.It  is	also  said that the Act is  a  colourable  piece  oflegislation,  namely, that though in form a  taxing  statuteit, in effect, is intended to expropriate lands, held by thecitizens  in the State by imposing a tax too heavy  for	 theland to bear.  As was said in Raja Bhairebendra Narayan Bhupv.  The	 State	of Assam (2)  "The  doctrine  of  colourablelegislation is relevant only in connection with the questionof  legislative	 competency".  In the  present	case,  therebeing  in my view, no want of legislative competency in	 thelegislature which passed the Act in question, the Act cannotbe assailed as a piece of colourable legislation.  I may addthat  I	 do not accept the argument that the Act is  in	 itsnature	expropriatary  or-  that the tax imposed  by  it  isreally excessive.(1)[1951] S.C.R. 127, 136.(2) [1956] S.C.R. 303.14106I come now to the last argument advanced by the petitioners.It  is	said  that   the  Act  was  beyond  the	 legislaturecompetence  of the  State Legislature.	It is conceded	thatthe  State Legislature has power to   impose a tax  on	landunder  entry  49 of List 2 in the Seventh  Schedule  to	 theConstitution, but it is said that land as mentioned in	thatentry does not include lands on which forests stand.  It  iscontended that the State Legislature has power to  legislateabout  forests	under entry 19 of that List and also  as  toland under entry 18.  There is however no power to impose  a-axon  forests while there is power under entry 49  of	thatlist  to tax land.  Therefore, it is said, that there is  nopower to impose tax on lands on which forests stand and	 theAct in so far as it imposes tax on lands covered by forests,which	the   lands  of	 the  petitioners  are,	  is   henceincompetent.It  is not in dispute that a State Legislature has no  powerto impose a tax on a matter with regard to which it has	 thepower  to legislate but has been given no express  power  toimpose a tax.  Therefore, I agree, that a State	 Legislaturecannot	impose tax on forests.	I am however  not  convincedthat  "land" in entry 49 is not intended to include land  onwhich  a  forest stands.  No doubt, a forest must  stand  onsome  land.  In Shorter Oxford Dictionary, one of the  mean-ings  of  "forest" is given as an extensive  tract  of	landcovered	 by  trees and undergrowth,  sometimes	intermingledwith pastures.	The concepts of forest and land however	 areentirely different.  The principal idea conveyed by the word"forest"  is the trees and other growth on the land.   Underentry  19 there may no doubt be legislation with  regard  toland in so far it is necessary for the purpose of the forestgrowing	 on  it.   It  is well known  that  entries  in	 thelegislative lists have to be read as widely as possible.  Itis  not necessary to cut down the plain meaning of the	word,"land" in entry 49 to give full effect to the word "forest"in  entry 19.  In my view, the two entries namely, entry  49and   entry  18	 deal  with  entirely	different   matters.Therefore, under entry 49 taxation			    107on land on which a forest stands is permissible and legal.For these reasons I would dismiss these petitions.BY COURT:-In accordance with the opinion of the majority  ofthe  Court, these Petitions are allowed with  costs  againstthe contesting Respondent, the State of Kerala.Petitions allowed.
