The  amountof  Rs.	 1,127 attributable out of item	 4  was	 accordinglytaken into the account of the previous year after  reopeningthe  assessment under s. 34 of the Income-tax Act,  and	 thecommission  on	the profits of the company  was	 apportionedbetween	 the period October 1, 1944, to March 31, 1945,	 andApril 1, 1945, to June 30, 1945, by the application of r.  9of  Sch. 1 of the Excess Profits Tax Act.  The	Tax  Officeralso  determined the proportionate commission payable  underitems 3 and 4, for the period ending March 31, 1946, and  asa  result of the apportionment, the liability of the  appel-lants,	original  and  revised, for income  tax	 and  ExcessProfits	 Tax for the assessment year 1945-46 and  chargeableaccounting period April 1, 1944, to March    31, 1945, stoodas follows:Original assessment of income taxRs. 1,04,654.Excess Profits TaxRs.		       45,292.Revised figuresIncome-tax (loss)  Rs. 36,182.Excess Profits TaxRs. 1,41,962-11-0.For  the assessment year 1946-47 and  chargeable  accountingperiod	April 1, 1945, to March 31, 1946, tax liability	 wascomputed at:Income-tax Rs. 1,66,271.Excess Profits Tax Rs. 1,13,163-5-0.The orders of assessmentfor  income tax and Excess  ProfitsTax  were confirmed by the Appellate Assistant	Commissionerand the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal.	On the	applicationsof the appellants275for reference under s. 66(1) of the Income-tax Act and s. 21of  the	 Excess	 Profits Tax Act, the  Tribunal	 drew  up  astatement  of  the  case and submitted	the  following	fourquestions to the High Court of Judicature at Madras:1.Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances  of  thecase, the Income-tax Officer/Excess Profits Tax Officer	 wasright in taking action under s. 34 and 15 of the  Income-taxand the Excess Profits Tax Act ?2.Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances of  thiscase, the provisions of r. 9, s. 1, were properly applied ?3.Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances  of  thecase, the Income-tax Officer/Excess Profits Tax Officer	 wascorrect in including the proportionate commission income  ofRs. 1,127 for income-tax assessment 1945-46 and Rs. 1,43,163plus Rs. 1,127 for Excess Profits Tax assessment Tax for thechargeable accounting period ending 31st March 1945, and4.Whether  on the facts and in the circumstances  of  thecase,  the  proportionate commission of Rs. 37,129  and	 Rs.2,299 were rightly assessed for the assessment year  1946-47?The  High  Court  answered all	the  questions	against	 theappellants  and	 in favour of the Department.	Against	 theorder  passed  by the High Court, these	 appeals  have	beenpreferred  with certificate granted under s. 66A(2)  of	 theIncome-Tax  Act	 read with s. 21 of the Excess	Profits	 TaxAct.Two questions were canvassed in these appeals:1.Whether  it was open to the Taxing Officer  to  re-openthe assessment for 1945-46; and2.Whether  the commission received by the appellants  wasliable to be apportioned under r. 9 of Sch. 1 of the  ExcessProfits Tax Act.The  appellants	 maintained their books of account  on	cashbasis and commission received from the company was  creditedafter the accounts of the company were closed.	The  amountsreceived by the appellants from the company were included intheir  return  and  assessment	for  the  year	1945-46	 wascompleted276for  the  purposes  of the Excess Profits  Tax	by  the	 TaxOfficer without apportionment appropriate to the  chargeableaccounting periods.  In so doing, the Tax Officer  committedan  error.   He	 overlooked the	 fact  that  the  chargeableaccounting  period for the as  assessment of Excess  ProfitsTax  and the year of account of the company did	 not  tally.Under  s.  15  of the Excess Profits Tax  Act,	if  the	 TaxOfficer	 discovers, in consequence of  definite	 informationwhich  has  come  into his possession that  profits  of	 anychargeable  accounting period chargeable to  excess  profitstax have escaped assessment, or have been under assessed, hemay  serve  on the person liable to pay such  tax  a  noticecontaining  all	 or  any of the requirements  which  may  beincluded  in a notice under s. 13 and may proceed to  assessor  reassess  the profits.  The provision  is  substantiallysimilar	 to  s. 34(1) of the Income-tax Act  before  it	 wasamended	 in  the  year 1948.  It is  manifest  that  by	 theassessment  of	income	made  on  the  assumption  that	 thechargeable  accounting period and the accounting  period  ofthe company tallied, there resulted under assessment in	 thecomputation of tax liability for Excess Profits Tax, and  itwas  open to the Tax Officer to take action under s.  15  ofthe Excess Profits Tax Act.Determination of the second question depends upon r. 9, Sob.1, of the Excess Profits Tax Act.  By s. 2(19) of the ExcessProfits Tax Act, the expression " profits " means profits asdetermined in accordance with Sch. 1. That schedule sets outrules  for  computation of profits for the  purpose  of	 theExcess	Profits Tax Act; and by r. 9, it is provided  in  sofar as it is material that:	      " Where the performance of a contract  extends	      beyond  the  accounting  period,	there  shall	      (unless the Excess Profits Tax Officer,  owing	      to   any	special	  circumstances,   otherwise	      directs)	be  attributed	to  the	  accounting	      period  such proportion of the entire  profits	      or  loss	which has resulted, or which  it  is	      estimated	 will  result,	from  the   complete	      performance  of  the contract as	is  properly	      attributable to the	      277	      accounting period, having regard to the extent	      to which the contract was performed therein."The performance of the contract of managing agency  extendedbeyond	the period of account of the company which was	July1,  1945,  to  June  30,  1946:	 it  covered  parts  of	 twoaccounting  periods.  The Tax Officer was therefore  obligedto  apportion  to  the, chargeable  accounting	periods	 theentire	profits resulting from the complete  performance  ofthe  contract  in proportions properly attributable  to	 theaccounting  periods and this, he proceeded to  do.   Counselfor the appellants contends that the contracts	contemplatedby  r.	9 are those of the nature of  engineering  or  workscontracts  and	the  like where execution  of  the  contractinvolves  a profit making operation de die in diem  and	 notcontracts  where remuneration is payable at a  certain	timefor services performed throughout the stipulated period.  Itis  true that remuneration was paid to the appellants  afterthe  expiry of the year of account of the company ; but	 thecontract   was	one  the  performance  of   which   extendedthroughout  the	 year  of  account  of	the  company.	 Theappellants were the managing agents of the company and	theyhad to perform their duties as managing agents for the wholeyear.  It is not disputed that the contract of agency for 20years is to be regarded for assessment of excess profits taxas  an	annual contract.  The performance  of  the  contractunmistakably  cut  across  the	accounting  period  is	alsomanifest.  The remuneration for performance of the  contractis  not	 computed  at a daily rate, but	 is  computed  on  apercentage  of the commission on the profits of the  companyfor the whole year, but on that account, the contract is notone in which performance does not extend throughout the yearof account.  Normally in a managing agency contract,the  managing agent may not suffer loss, but that  does	 notrule  out  the	application  of	 r.  9	to  managing  agencycontracts.  The terms in which r. 9 is enacted are  general:the  rule is applicable to all contracts which are  intendedto be operative for a fixed period.  If, for the performanceof the entire contract,278remuneration  is  payable at rates  stipulated,	 the  profitearned	out of that remuneration must be apportioned in	 themanner	provided by r. 9 if the performance of the  contractextends beyond the accounting periodThe judgment of this Court in E. D. Sassoon & Co.,  Ltd.  v.The  Commissioner  of Income Tax, Bombay  City(1)  on  whichstrong	reliance  was  placed  by  the	appellants  has	  noapplication to this case.  In that case, M/s.  E. D. Sassoon&  Co.,	 Ltd. who were managing agents	of  three  differentcompanies  transferred the managing agencies to three  othercompanies  on several dates during the accounting  year.   Aquestion  arose in the computation of income-tax payable  byM/s.  E. D. Sassoon & Co., Ltd. whether the managing  agencycommission was liable to be apportioned between M/s.  E.  D.Sassoon & Co., Ltd. and their respective transferees in	 theproportion  of the services rendered as managing agents	 forthe respective periods of the accounting year.	It was	heldby this court (Jagannadhadas, J., dissenting) that on a trueinterpretation	of  the managing agency agreements  in	eachcase, the contract of service between the companies and	 themanaging   agents  was	entire	and  indivisible   and	 theremuneration  or commission became due by the  companies  tothe  managing agents only on completion of definite  periodsof  service and at stated intervals ; that complete  perfor-mance was a condition precedent to the recovery of wages  orsalary	in  respect  thereof and  the  remuneration  payableconstituted a debt only at the end of each period of servicecompletely  performed, no remuneration or  commission  beingpayable	 to the managing agents for broken periods; that  noincome	was  earned by or accrued to M/s.  E. D.  Sassoon  &Co.,  Ltd.  and	 as the transfer of  the  agencies  did	 notinclude	 any  income  which E. D. Sassoon &  Co.,  Ltd.	 hadearned,	 they were not liable to be taxed under the  Income-Tax Act.  But that was a case dealing with liability of	 theassessees  who	did not receive any income and	to  whom  noincome had accrued to pay(1)[1955] 1 S.C. R. 313.270income	tax  on the amounts of remuneration  paid  to  theirtransferees.   The  court was not called upon  to  apply  toincome	 received   by	the  assessee	the   principle	  ofapportionment  under r. 9 of Sch.  1 of the  Excess  ProfitsTax  Act, or any provision similar thereto.  It is r.  9  ofSch.  I which attracts the principle of apportionment.	 Therule  enunciated in M/s, E. D. Sassoon & Co.'s case (1)	 hastherefore  no application to this case, and the	 High  Courtwas right in holding that the assessment made by the  ExcessProfits	 Tax  Officer  by apportionment	 of  the  commissionincome	 between  the  chargeable  accounting  periods	 wascorrect.The  appeals  therefore fail and are dismissed	with  costs.One hearing fee.Appeals dismissed.		    __________________
