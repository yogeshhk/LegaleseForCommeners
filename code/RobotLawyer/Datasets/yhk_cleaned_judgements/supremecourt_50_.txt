PETITIONER:THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH	Vs.RESPONDENT:THE GWALIOR SUGAR CO., LTD.,AND OTHERS(AND CONNECTED APPEAL)DATE OF JUDGMENT:30/11/1960BENCH:ACT:Cess-Levy on sugar cane ordered by erstwhile Ruler-Consti-tutional validity-Constitution of India, Arts. 14, 265, 373.HEADNOTE:In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing,	 forwhich  it was necessary to develop the cane area, the  Rulerof  the erstwhile Gwalior State by an order dated  27-7-1946sanctioned  the	 levy of cess of one anna per maund  on	 allsugar  cane purchased by the respondent company.   When	 theGovernment  of Madhya Bharat, which was the successor  stateof  the former Gwalior State, made a demand for	 payment  ofthe  cess, the respondent filed a petition before  the	HighCourt of Madhya ,Bharat challenging the legality of the levyon  the grounds (1) that the order dated 27-7-1946 was	onlyan  executive  order  and not a law under Art.	265  of	 theConstitution  of  India and that, therefore,  there  was  noauthority  for the imposition of the cess after January	 26,1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and  violatedArt. 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable  topay  the  cess the other sugar factories in the	 State	wereexempt.	  It was found that at the time when cess was  firstlevied	there  was  no sugar factory  in  existence  in	 theGwalior State other than that of the respondent.Held, that (i) the Ruler of an Indian State was an  absolutemonarch	 in which there was no constitutional limitation  toact   in  any  manner  he  liked,  he  being   the   supremelegislature,  the supreme judiciary and the supreme head  ofthe  executive.	 I Consequently, the order  dated  27-7-1946issued	by  the	 Ruler of Gwalior State amounted  to  a	 lawenacted by him and became an existing law under Art. 372  ofthe  Constitution of India.  The levy of cess was  thereforeby authority of law within the meaning of Art. 265;Madhaorao  Phalke  v. The State of Madhya Bharat,  [1961]  1S.C.R. 957, followed.(2)  the levy of cess did not contravene Art. 14 because (a)the object was cane development in the particular area and ageographical  classification based upon	 historical  factorswas  a	permissible mode of classification, and	 (b)  a	 taxcould  not  be struck down as discriminatory unless  it	 wasfound  that  it was imposed with a deliberate  intention  ofdifferentiating between620(ii) where the order is passed by the Sub-divisional  AnimalHusbandry  Officer,  under  sub-rule (5),  to  the  DistrictAnimal Husbandry Officer and(iii) where the order is passed by the authority  prescribedunder  sub-rule (1) to the Sub-divisional  Animal  HusbandryOfficer,  if  there is one; if not, to the  District  AnimalHusbandry Officer;(b)  The appeal shall not be decided against  the  appellantunless	he has been given a reasonable opportunity of  beingheard."The  argument on behalf of the petitioners is that they	 are"Kassais"  by  profession  and they  earn  their  living  byslaughtering  cattle  only  (not goats or  sheep  which	 areslaughtered  by	 "Chiks"); that they  have  the	 fundamentalright to carry on their profession and trade; and that s.  3of   the   Act	 read  with  r.	  3   imposes	unreasonablerestrictions--restrictions  not	 in  the  interests  of	 thegeneral public-on their fundamental right and therefore theyare  not  saved by cl. (6) of Art. 19 of  the  Constitution.Some of these arguments were considered by this Court in Md.Hanif Quareshi v. The State of Bihar (1) and it was  pointedout  that  the test of reasonableness should be	 applied  toeach  individual statute impugned and no abstract  standard,or  general pattern, of reasonableness can be laid  down  asapplicable  to	all cases.  It referred to the	decision  inState of Madras v. V. G. Row (2) and repeated what was	saidtherein	 that "the nature of the right alleged to have	beeninfringed,  the	 underlying  purpose  of  the	restrictionsimposed,  the  extent and urgency of the evil sought  to  beremedied  thereby, the disproportion of the imposition,	 theprevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into thejudicial  verdict." 'Another consideration which has  to  bekept  in mind is that "the legislature is the best judge  ofwhat is good for the community,. by whose suffrage it  comesinto existence...................... (See The State of Biharv.  Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of  Darbhanga  (3)).But the ultimate responsibility for determining the validityof the law must rest with the(1) [1950] S.C.R. 629.		 (2) [1952] S.C.R. 597.(3) [1952] S.C.R. 889.621Court and the Court must not shirk that solemn duty cast  onit  by the Constitution.  We must, therefore,  approach	 theproblem	 before us in the light of the principles laid	downby this Court.The  most  pertinent question is-having regard	to  all	 therelevant circumstances, is the age of 25 years laid down  ins.   3	a  reasonable  restriction  on	the  right  of	 thepetitioners in the interests of the general public ? We	 areunable to say that it is.  Apart from the affidavits made onbehalf of the petitioners and the respondent State, a  largevolume	of authoritative and expert opinion has been  placedbefore us which shows beyond any doubt that a bull,  bullockor  she-buffalo does not remain useful after 14 or 15  yearsand  only  a few of them live up to the age of 25.   In	 theReport of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee,published by the Ministry of Agriculture, it is	 recommendedby the Committee that the slaughter of animals over 14 yearsof  age	 and  unfit  for work as also  animals	of  any	 agepermanently  unable  to work owing to injury  or  deformity,should	be allowed.  In the Report on the Marketing of	Meatin India (published by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture)there  is  a  reference to a draft Bill	 circulated  by	 theMinistry  of  Agriculture  (page 112 of	 the  Report)  whichcontains  a  clause that animals over 14 years	of  age	 andunfit  for work may be slaughtered on a certificate  from  aVeterinary  Officer.   In  the Report on  the  Marketing  ofCattle in India, again published by the Ministry of Food andAgriculture, occurs the following passage as to the price ofanimals with reference to their age:"Young	draught animals up to the age of 4  years-being	 rawand untrained-fetch comparatively low prices.  Between 4 and8 years of age, the animals are in the prime of their  youthand tender best service, and fetch maximum prices.  From the8th  year onwards old age sets in, and a graded	 decline  isobserved  in their capacity to work and consequently  pricesdepreciate considerably." .In  a Food and Agricultural Organisation study of cattle  inIndia and Pakistan (Zebu Cattle of India and79622Pakistan,  page	 94) it is stated that the  active  breedinglife  of  a  bull is estimated to be  about  10	 years.	  InBlack's Veterinary Dictionary (edited by W. C. Miller and G.P.  West, fifth edition) it is stated that  pedigree  ,bullsmay reach 12 or 14 years of age before being discarded;	 andcattle seldom live longer than 15 or 16 years, and when theydo,  their  age is usually of no immediate  importance.	  Inanother	 publication of the Ministry of	 Agriculture  called'Problems  of Cattle Insurance' under Indian conditions,  itis  stated  that the life of cattle  is	 comparatively	muchshorter,  the maximum age being only about 15 years.   Thereis an interesting chart relating to the determination of agein  cattle  in a publication called 'Cattle  Development  inUttar Pradesh' by R. L. Kaura, Director of Animal Husbandry;that  chart shows that at II years incisors  appear  smallerdue  to wearing out; at 12 years space appears	between	 theteeth,	and  after 12 teeth wear out  constantly  and  rootsremain	far  apart from one another.  As  against  all	thisexpert opinion the respondent State has relied on the  chartembodying some useful data about domestic animals,  preparedby  Major A. C. Aggarwala, Director of Veterinary  Services,Punjab,	  and  R.  R.  Gulati,	Superintendent,	  VeterinaryDepartment,  Jullandur, which shows the sterility age  of  abuffalo at 15 and average age at 25, and of a cow  sterilityat 15 and 16 years and average life 22 years.JUDGMENT:ORIGINAL JURISDICTION:We are clearly of the view that the almost unanimous opinionof experts is that after the age of 15, bulls. bullocks	 andbuffaloes  are	no longer useful for breeding,	draught	 andother purposes and whatever little use they may have then isgreatly offset by the economic disadvantages of feeding	 andmaintaining  unserviceable cattle-disadvantages to which  wehad referred in much greater detail in Md.  Hanif Quareshi'scase  (1).  Section 3 of the Bihar Act in so far as  it	 hasincreased the age limit to 25 in respect of bulls,  bullocksand  she-buffaloes, imposes an unreasonable  restriction  onthe  fundamental  right of the	petitioners,  a	 restrictionmoreover which cannot be said to be in(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 629.623the  interests of the general public, and to that extent  itis  void.  We may here repeat what we said in Chintaman	 Raov. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1):"The  phrase  'reasonable  restriction'	 connotes  that	 thelimitation  imposed  on a person in enjoyment of  the  rightshould	not be arbitrary or of an excessive  nature,  beyondwhat  is required in the interests of the public.  The	word'reasonable' implies intelligent care and deliberation, thatis,   the  choice  of  a  course  which	  reason   dictates.Legislation  which  arbitrarily or excessively	invades	 theright	cannot	 be   said  to	contain	  the	quality	  ofreasonableness	and  unless  it	 strikes  a  proper  balancebetween	 the  freedom guaranteed in Art.  19(1)(g)  and	 thesocial	control permitted by clause (6) of Art. 19, it	mustbe held to be wanting in that quality."As  to	r. 3 the grievances of the  petitioners	 are  these.Under  the rule the prescribed authority for the purpose  ofs.  3 of the Act consists of the Veterinary Officer and	 theChairman or Chief Officer of a District Board,	Municipalityetc.   Unless  both  of	 them  concur,	no  certificate	 forslaughter  can	be  granted.  It is  pointed  out  that	 theChairman  or  Chief  Officer  would be a  layman  not  in  aposition  to  judge the age or usefulness  of  cattle.	 Theresult	would  be  that the animal in  respect	of  which  acertificate  is	 required  may	have  to  be  shown  to	 theVeterinary  Officer as also the Chairman or  Chief  Officer,who  may not be staying at the same place as the  VeterinaryOfficer.   If the two differ, the matter has to be  referredto  the	 Sub-divisional	 Animal	 Husbandry  Officer.	Thisprocedure, it is contended, will involve the expenditure  ofso  much money and time that it will not be  worthwhile	 forthe  petitioners to ask for a certificate, or having  got  acertificate,  to slaughter the animal.	An animal  which  isabove  15 or which has become useless generally	 costs	muchless  than a young, serviceable animal.	 If the	 petitionershave  to incur all the expenditure which the procedure	laiddown  by  r. 3 must necessarily cost them,  then  they	mustclose  down their trade.  As to the right of appeal from  anorder refusing to grant a(1) [1950] S.C.R. 759,763.624certificate,  it  is  contended	 that  that  right  is	alsoillusory for all practical purposes.  To take the animal  tothe  Deputy  Director of Animal Husbandry  or  the  DistrictAnimal	Husbandry  Officer  or the  Sub-divi  sional  AnimalHusbandry Officer, as the case may be, and to keep and	feedthe animal for the period of the appeal and its hearing willcost more than the price of the animal itself.We  consider that these grievances of the  petitioners	havesubstance, and judged from the practical point of view,	 theprovisions  of r. 3 impose disproportionate restrictions  ontheir  right.	It  is	difficult  to  understand  why	 theVeterinary   Officer,  who  has	 the   necessary   technicalknowledge, cannot be trusted to give the certificate and whyit should be necessary to resort to a complicated  procedureto  resolve  a possible difference of  opinion	between	 twoofficers, later followed by a still more expensive appeal.We,  therefore,	 hold r. 3 also to be bad in so	 far  as  itimposes	 disproportionate restrictions indicated  above,  onthe right of the petitioners.(2) We now proceed to consider the Uttar Pradesh  Preventionof Cow Slaughter (Amendment) Act, 1958.	 After the  decisionof  this Court in Md.  Hanif Quareshi v. The State of  Bihar(1)  an	 Ordinance  was	 passed	 called	 the  Uttar  PradeshPrevention  of	Cow Slaughter (Amendment)  Ordinance,  1958.This  Ordinance was later repealed and replaced by the	Act.The  petitioners say that in the Bill as originally  draftedthe age limit below which slaughter was not permissible	 wasput at 15 years; but the Select Committee increased it to 20years.	It will probably be best, for clearness sake, to setforth not the whole provisions of the Act, for that would betoo lengthy, but those which form most directly the  subjectmatter on which the controversy turns.	Section 3 of the Actreads (omitting portions not relevant for our purpose)-"S.  3(1)  Except as hereinafter provided, no  person  shallslaughter or cause to be slaughtered or offer or cause to beoffered for slaughter-(a)..........................................(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 629.625(b)  a	bull or bullock, unless he has obtained	 in  respectthereof	 a  certificate	 in  writing,  from  the   competentauthority of the area in which the bull or bullock is to  beslaughtered, certifying that it is fit for slaughter...(2)  No bull or bullock, in respect of which  a	 certificatehas   been  issued  under  sub-section	(1)(b)	 shall	 be'slaughtered  at any place other than the place indicated  inthe  certificate or within twenty days of the date of  issueof the certificate.(3)  A certificate under sub-section (1)(b) shall be  issuedby  the competent authority, only after it has, for  reasonsto  be	recorded in writing, certified that(a) the  bull  orbullock is over the age of twenty years; and(b)  in the case of a bull, it has become permanently  unfitand  unserviceable for the purpose of breeding and,  in	 thecase  of  a  bullock, it has become  permanently  unfit	 andunserviceable  for the purposes of draught and any  kind  ofagricultural operation:Provided  that the permanent unfitness	or  unserviceabilityhas not been caused deliberately.(4)  The  competent  authority	shall,	before	issuing	 thecertificate  under sub-section (3) or refusing to issue	 thesame, record its order in writing.  Any person aggrieved  bythe  order of the competent authority, under  this  section,may,  within  twenty days of the date of the  order,  appealagainst	 it  to the State Government, which  may  pass	suchorders thereon as it may deem fit.(5) The State Government may, at any time, for the  purposesof satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of	 theaction	taken under this section, call for and	examine	 therecord	of any case and may pass such orders thereon  as  itmay deem fit.(6)  Subject to the provisions herein contained	 any  actiontaken under this section, shall be final and conclusive	 andshall not be called in question."On  behalf of the petitioners it has been argued that  s.  3imposes a number of unreasonable restrictions.	Firstly,  itis urged that the age-limit with regard to bulls or bullocksis put too high, viz. at 20 years.  This is an626aspect	which we have already considered in relation to	 theBihar Act.  What we have said about the age s limit in	thatconnexion applies equally to the Uttar Pradesh Act.  The 8thLive-stock  Census, 1956 shows	that in Uttar Pradesh  bullsand bullocks over 3 years of age, not in use for breeding orwork,  numbered	 as many as 126,201 in 1956 as	compared  to162,746 in 1951.  The Municipal Manual, Uttar Pradesh,	Vol.1,  contains  a	 direction that for  slaughter	of  animals,bullocks  and male buffaloes in good state of  health  belowten  years  of	age should be  included.   Secondly,  it  ispointed	  out  that  not  being	 content  with	 fixing	  anunreasonably high age-limit, the impugned provision  imposesa double restriction.  It says that the animal must be	overtwenty	years in age and must also be permanently unfit	 andunserviceable;	and in the case of a bullock, the  unfitnessmust  be  for "any kind of agricultural operation"  and	 notmerely	for  draught purposes.	The result  of	this  doublerestriction,  it  is stated, is that even if the  animal  ispermanently  unserviceable and unfit at an earlier  age,  itcannot be slaughtered unless it is over twenty years in age.Before	a certificate can be given, the animal	must  fulfiltwo  conditions as to (1) age and (2)  permanent  unfitness.We   consider  this  to	 be  a	 demonstrably	unreasonablerestriction.   In Md.  Hanif Quareshi's case (1) this  Courthad  said  that a total ban on the slaughter  of  bulls	 andbullocks after they had ceased to be capable of breeding  orworking	 as draught animals was not in the interests of	 thegeneral	 public.   Yet	this is exactly	 what  the  impugnedprovision  does by imposing a double restriction.   It	laysdown  that even if the animal is permanently  unserviceable,no certificate can be given unless it is more than 20  yearsin  age.  The restriction will in effect put an end  to	 thetrade of the petitioners.Thirdly, the impugned provision provides (1) that the animalshall  not be slaughtered within 20 days of the date of	 theissue  of the certificate and (2) that any person  aggrievedby  the order of the competent authority may appeal  to	 theState Government within 20 days.  It is to be noted that theright of appeal is not(1)  [1939] S.C R. 629.627confined to a refusal to grant a certificate as in the BiharAct,  but the right is given to any person aggrieved by	 theorder of the competent authority.  In other words, even whena  certificate	is given, any person, even a member  of	 thepublic,	 who feels aggrieved by it may prefer an appeal	 andhold  up the slaughter of the animal for a long time.	Fromthe practical point of view these restrictions really put  atotal ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks even  afterthey  have ceased to be useful, and we must hold,  followingour decision in Md.  Hanif Quareshi's case (1) that s. 3  ofthe  Uttar Pradesh Act in so far as it imposes	unreasonablerestrictions on the right of the petitioners as to slaughterof bulls and bullocks infringes the fundamental right of thepetitioners and is to that extent void.(3)  Now,  we  come  to the  Madhya  Pradesh  Act.   Severalprovisions  of	this Act have been challenged before  us  asimposing unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental  rightof  the	 petitioners.  Section 4 deals with  prohibition  ofslaughter   of	 agricultural	cattle.	   The	  expression'agricultural  cattle'	means  an animal  specified  in	 theschedule:  it means cows of all ages; calves of cows and  ofshe-buffaloes;	 bulls;	 bullocks;  and	 male	and   femalebuffaloes.   As we have stated earlier, we are concerned  inthese cases with the validity of the restrictions placed  onthe  slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes.  Now, s.  4is in these terms:"S. 4(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other lawfor the time being in force or in any usage or custom to thecontrary,   no	person	shall  slaughter  or  cause  to	  beslaughtered or offer or cause to be offered, for slaughter-(a)  cows, calves of cows, or calves of she-buffaloes, or(b) any other agricultural cattle unless he has obtained  inrespect	 of such cattle a certificate in writing  issued  bythe Competent Authority for the area in which the cattle  isto be slaughtered that the cattle is fit for slaughter.(1)  [1959] S.C.R.29.628(2) No certificate under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shallbe issued by the Competent Authority .unless the  VeterinaryOfficer after examining the cattle certifies that-(a) the cattle is over twenty years of age and is unfit	 forwork  or  breeding or has become  permanently  incapacitatedfrom  work or breeding due to age, injury, deformity  or  anincurable disease; and(b) the cattle is not suffering from any disease which makesits meat unwholesome for human consumption.(3)  The  Competent  Authority	shall,	before	issuing	  orrefusing  to issue a certificate under this section,  recordits order in writing.  Any person aggrieved by the order  ofthe Competent Authority under this section, may, within	 tendays of the date of the order, prefer an appeal against suchorder to the Collector of the district or such other officeras may, by notification, be authorised in this behalf by theState  Government, and the Collector or such  other  officermay pass such orders thereon as he thinks fit.(4)  Subject to the orders passed in appeal, if	 any,  undersub-section (3), the order of the Competent Authority  shallbe final and shall not be called in question in any Court."Section 5 places a restriction as to the place and time	 forslaughter  and the objection taken before us relates to	 thetime  rather  than to the place of slaughter.	It  says  ineffect that no cattle in respect of which a certificate	 hasbeen issued under s. 4 shall be slaughtered within ten	daysof the date of issue of the certificate and where an  appealis preferred against the grant of such certificate, till thetime such appeal is disposed of. The provision of appeal  iscontained  in  sub-s. (3) of s. 4 of the Act which  we	havequoted earlier.	 That sub-section lays down that any  personaggrieved  by  the order of the	 Competent  Authority,	may,within	ten days of the date of the order, prefer an  appealagainst	 the order to the Collector of the district or	suchother officer as may, by notification, be authorised in thisbehalf by the State Government.629Section	 6  imposes  a	restriction  on	 the  transport	  ofagricultural cattle for slaughter and reads:"S.  6. No person shall transport or offer for transport  orcause  to  be transported any agricultural cattle  from	 anyplace  within the State to any place outside the State,	 forthe  purpose  of  its  slaughter  in  contravention  of	 theprovisions of this Act or with the knowledge that it will beor is likely to be, so slaughtered."Section 7 prohibits the sale, purchase or disposal otherwiseof certain kinds of animals.  It reads-."S.  7. No person shall purchase, sell or otherwise  disposeof  or	offer to purchase, sell or otherwise dispose  of  orcause  to be purchased, sold or otherwise disposed of  cows,calves	of cows or calves of shebuffaloes for  slaughter  orknowing	 or having reason to believe that such cattle  shallbe slaughtered."Section	 8  relates to possession of flesh  of	agriculturalcattle	and  is	 in  these  terms:  "S.	 8.  Notwithstandinganything  contained in any other law for the time  being  inforce,	no person shall have in his possession flesh of	 anyagricultural  cattle  slaughtered in  contravention  of	 theprovisions of this Act."Section	 10  imposes  a penalty for a  contravention  of  s.4(1)(a) and s. 11 imposes penalty for a contravention of anyof the other provisions of the Act.On  behalf of the petitioners it has been pointed  out,	 andrightly	 in our opinion, that cl. (a) of sub-s. (2) of s.  4of the Act imposes an unreasonable restriction on the  rightof the petitioners.  That clause in its first part lays downthat the cattle (other than cows and calves) must be over 20years  of age and must also be unfit for work  or  breeding;and  in the second part it says, "or has become	 permanentlyincapacitated  from  work or breeding due  to  age,  injury,deformity or an incurable disease." It is a little difficultto  understand	why  the two parts  are	 juxtaposed  in	 thesection.   In any view the restriction that the animal	mustbe over 20 years of age and also unfit for work or  breedingis an excessive or unreasonable restriction as we have80630pointed out with regard to a similar provision in the  UttarPradesh	 Act.	The second part of the clause would  not  beopen to any objection, if it stood by itself.  If,  however,it  has	 to be combined with the agelimit mentioned  in	 thefirst part of the clause, it will again be open to the	sameobjection;  if the animal is to be over 20 years of age	 andalso   permanently  incapacitated  from	 work  or   breedingetc.,then  the	agelimit is really meaningless.	  Then,	 theexpression  'due  to age' in the second part of	 the  clausealso loses its meaning.	 It seems to us that cl. (a) of sub-s.  (2)	 of  s. 4 of the Act as drafted is  bad	 because  itimposes	 a disproportionate restriction on the slaughter  ofbulls, bullocks and buffaloes it is a restriction  excessivein  nature and not in the interests of the  general  public.The  test  laid down is not merely permanent  incapacity  orunfitness  for	work or breeding but the test  is  somethingmore than that, a combination of age and unfitness'  LearnedCounsel	 for  the  petitioners	has  placed  before  us	  anobservation contained in a reply made by the Deputy Ministerin  the	 course	 of the debate on the  Bill  in	 the  MadhyaPradesh	 Assembly (see Madhya Pradesh Assembly	Proceedings,Vol.  5 Serial no. 34 dated April 14, 1959, page 3201).	  Hesaid that the age fixed was very much higher than the one towhich any animal survived.  This observation has been placedbefore	us  not	 with a view to	 an  interpretation  of	 thesection,  but  to show what opinion was held by	 the  DeputyMinister  as  to  the proper agelimit.	 On  behalf  of	 therespondent  State  our attention has been drawn	 to  a	bookcalled	The  Miracle of Life (Home Library  Club)  in  whichthere is a statement that oxen, given good conditions,	liveabout  40  years.   Our attention has  also  been  drawn  tocertain	 extracts from a Hindi book called Godhan by  GirishChandra	 Chakravarti  in which there are statements  to	 theeffect that cows and bullocks may live up to 20 or 25 years.This  is  an aspect of the case with which we  have  alreadydealt.	 The question before us is not the maximum age	uptowhich bulls, bullocks and buffaloes may live in rare  cases.The  question before us is what is their  average  longevityand at what age631they  become  useless.	On this question we think  that	 theopinion	 is  almost  unanimous, and the	 opinion  which	 theDeputy Minister expressed was not wrong.Section	 5 in so far as it imposes a restriction as  to	 thetime  for slaughter is again open to the same  objection  ashas been discussed by us with regard to a similar  provisionin the Uttar Pradesh Act.  A right of appeal is given to anyperson aggrieved by the order.	In other words, a member  ofthe  public, if he feels aggrieved by the order	 granting  acertificate for slaughter, may prefer an appeal and hold  upfor  a	long  time the slaughter of  the  animal.   We	havepointed	  out  that  for  all  practical  purposes  such   arestriction  will  really  put an end to the  trade  of	 thepetitioners  and  we are unable to accept a  restriction  ofthis kind as a reasonable restriction within the meaning  ofcl. (6) of Art. 19 of the Constitution.Section	 6 standing by itself, we think, is not open to	 anyserious	 objection.  It is ancillary in nature and tries  togive  effect  to  the  provision  of  the  Act	 prohibitingslaughter of cattle in contravention of the Act.Section 7 relates to the prohibition of sale, purchase etc.,of  cows  and  calves and inasmuch as a	 total	ban  on	 theslaughter  of cows and calves is valid, no objection can  betaken to s. 7 of the Act.  It merely seeks to effectuate thetotal ban on the slaughter of cows and calves (both of	cowsand   she-buffaloes).	Section	 8  is	also  ancillary	  incharacter and if the other provisions are valid no objectioncan  be taken to the provisions of s. 8. Sections 10 and  11impose	penalties  and their validity  cannot  be  seriouslydisputed.However,  we  must say a few words about s. 12	of  the	 Actwhich has also been challenged before us.  Section 12 is  inthese terms:"S.  12.   In  any trial for  an  offence  punishable  undersection 11 for contravention of the provision of sections 5,6 or 7 of this Act the burden of proving that the slaughter,transport  or  sale  of	 agricultural  cattle  was  not	  incontravention of the provisions of this Act shall be on	 theaccused."The argument is that s. 12 infringes the fundamental632right  of the petitioners inasmuch as it puts the burden  ofproof on an accused person not only for his own knowledge orintention  but	for  the knowledge  or	intention  of  otherpersons.   We do not think that this contention is  correct.The  accused  person, so far as ss. 5 and 7  are  concerned,must be the person who has slaughtered the animal or who haspurchased,  sold  or otherwise disposed of the	animal	etc.Therefore,  the only question will be his knowledge and	 thelegislature  was competent to place the burden of  proof  onhim.  So far as s. 6 is concerned, it specifically refers tothe  knowledge of the person who has transported or  offeredfor  transport or caused to be transported any	agriculturalcattles from any place within the State to any place outsidethe State.  Therefore, when the section talks of  knowledge,it talks of the knowledge of that person who has transportedor  offered  for transport etc.	 The knowledge of  no  otherperson	comes into the purview of s. 6. We are,	 therefore,'of  the	 view that s. 12 is not invalid on the	ground	sug-gested by the petitioners.Therefore,  the	 result of our examination  of	the  variousprovisions of the Act is that the impugned provisions in cl.(a) of sub-s. (2) of s. 4, in sub-s. (3) of s. 4 relating tothe  right of appeal by any person aggrieved by	 the  order,and  in	 s.  5 relating to the	time  of  slaughter,  imposeunreasonable and disproportionate restrictions which must beheld to be unconstitutional.As  to the Madhya Pradesh Agricultural	Cattle	PreservationRules,	r.  3 says "that an application	 for  a	 certificateunder s. 4 shall be made to the competent authority," and r.4  says	 that on receipt of the application,  the  competentauthority  shall by an order direct the person	keeping	 theanimal	to  submit  it for  examination	 by  the  VeterinaryOfficer Rule 5 reproduces the provisions of cls. (a) and (b)of sub-s. (2) of s. 4 and in so far as we have held that theprovision   in	 el.  (a)  of  sub-s.  (2)  of	 s.   4	  isunconstitutional, the rule must also fall with it.There  is  one other aspect of these cases  which  has	beenemphasized before us, to which a reference must633now  be	 made.	 It  is open to	 the  legislature  to  enactancillary  provisions to give effect to the main  object  ofthe Act, namely, the prevention of slaughter of animals likebulls, bullocks or buffaloes which are still useful for	 thepurposes  for which they are generally used.  It is  pointedout  that acts innocent in themselves may be prohibited	 andthe restrictions in that regard would be reasonable, if	 thesame were necessary to secure efficient enforcement of validprovisions.  For example, it is open to the legislature,  ifit feels it necessary, in order to reduce the  possibilitiesof  evasion  to a minimum, to enact provisions	which  wouldgive effect to the main object of the legislation.  We	havenot ignored this aspect and have kept in mind the undisputedright  of  the	legislature to decide  what  provisions	 arenecessary  to  give  effect  to	 the  main  object  of	 thelegislation.  In these cases the petitioners have complainedthat  the main object of the impugned provisions is not	 theprohibition of slaughter of animals which are still  useful;the  impugned  provisions as they are worded  really  put  atotal ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and  buffaloesand  for  all  practical purposes they put  a  stop  to	 theprofession and trade of the petitioners.  We have held	thatthis   complaint  is  justified	 in  respect  of  the	mainprovisions in the three Acts.We, therefore, allow the three writ petitions and direct, aswe directed in Md.  Hanif Quareshi's case (1) the respondentStates not to enforce the Acts or the rules made  thereunderin  so	far  as they have been declared	 void  by  us.	 Thepetitioners  will be entitled to their costs of the  hearingin this Court.Petitions allowed.(1) [1959] S.C.R. 629.634
