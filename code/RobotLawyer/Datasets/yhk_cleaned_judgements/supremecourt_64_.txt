On October  27,  i865,	 theGovernment  called  upon the justices to pay a	sum  of	 Rs.7,728-13-8,  which represented the amount capitalised at  20years'	purchase  of  land revenue attributed  to  the	areaacquired.  On  December	 5, i870,  the	Secretary  of  Stateexecuted in favour of the justices of the Peace a conveyanceof the land acquired, which stated, inter alia, that it	 was"ever  free  and  clear and for	 ever  discharged  from	 allGovernment land revenue whatever or any payment or charge inthe nature thereof to the end and intent that the said	landmay   be  used	for  a	public	purpose,  namely,  for	 theconservancy  of the town." On January 23, 1880, a  lease  ofthe land was granted by the Justices to the predecessors-in-title of the appellant, under which the lessee had the rightto carry on cultivation with the aid of sewage.Before the income-tax authorities the appellant claimed thatthe agricultural income derived by him from the land was notliable	to  income-tax, but the claim was  rejected  on	 theground	that  on  the  payment of a  lump-sum  in  1865	 theliability  to  pay  land revenue was redeemed  and  no	landrevenue	 was demanded thereafter; consequently,	 the  incomederived from the land was not agricultural income within themeaning	 of S. 2(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922,	 andwas  not,  therefore,  exempt  from  tax.   The	 appellant'scontention  was that the redemption only saved the  justicesfrom   liability  for  payment	but  did  not	affect	 theassessability  of the land to revenue under Regulation 1  of1793.599Held,  that  by the down payment of a lump sum in  1865	 theentire	land  revenue  to be recovered	from  the  land	 wasredeemed  and  the  land  became  free	from  land   revenueassessment  in perpetuity, as completely as if there was  noassessment.   Thereafter, the land could not be said  to  beassessed  to land revenue within the meaning of S.  2(1)  ofthe  Indian  Income-tax Act, 1922,  and,  consequently,	 theincome	derived	 therefrom  could not be  considered  to  beagricultural income under that section.The  Collector of Bombay v.

No. 20 of 1953.S.   Mitra, B. Das and S. N. Mukherjee, for appellants Nos.2 to 41.A.   N. Kripal and D. Gupta, for the respondent.1960.  November 23.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH, J.-The point involved in this appeal is a veryshort  one;  but it requires a long narration  of  facts  toreach  it.  The appeal is against the judgment and order  ofthe  High Court of Calcutta dated May 15, 1956, arising	 outof an Income-tax Reference.By  the	 Calcutta  Municipal  Act  VI  of  1863,  there	 wasestablished a Corporation under the name of "The Justices ofthe  Peace  for the Town of Calcutta".	 By  a	notificationissued on November 2, 1864, one square mile of land  formingpart  of  the  Panchannagram  Estate  was  acquired  by	 theGovernment  of	Bengal	at the	instance  of  the  Justices.Section CXII of the Municipal Act provided that the Justicesmight  "agree with the owners of any land for  the  absolutepurchase thereof............ for any other purpose  whateverconnected  with	 the  conservancy of the  Town".   Under  s.CXIII,	it was provided that if there was any  hindrance  toacquisition by private treaty, the Government of Bengal uponthe  representation  of	 the  Justices	would	compulsorilyacquire the land and vest600such  land  in	the Justices on	 their	paying	compensationawarded	 to the proprietor.  The action which was  taken  bythe  notification was under s. CXIII of the  Municipal	Act,and the acquisition was under Act VI of 1857, an Act for theacquisition of land for public purposes.The  Panchannagram  Estate  was	 permanently  settled  underRegulation 1 of 1793.  After the acquisition, the proprietorof  Panchannagram  Estate  was	granted	 abatement  of	landrevenue assessed on the Estate to the extent of Rs. 386-7-1.This represented the proportionate land revenue on the	landacquired.In  August,  1865,  the Justices were required	to  pay	 Rs.54,685-2-10 as compensation payable to the proprietor and toother  persons holding interest in the land.  Another  pieceof land which is described as an open level sewer, was	alsoacquired about the same time, and separate compensation	 waspaid  for  it.	With the amount of conveyance  charges,	 thetotal compensation thus paid by the Justices was Rs. 57,965-8-10.	On October 27,1865, the Government called  upon	 theJustices to pay a further sum of Rs. 7,728-13-8.  This orderhas   not  been	 produced  in  the  case;  but	from   othercorrespondence,	  it  is  easy	to  see	 that	the   amountrepresented  an amount capitalized at 20 years' purchase  ofland revenue attributed to the area acquired, which, as	 hasbeen  stated above, came to Rs. 386-7-1.  This	payment	 wasmade  on  or  about January 12,	 1866.	 Similarly,  anotheramount	was paid in July of the same year for redemption  ofthe  land  revenue in respect of the strip of land  for	 theopen sewer.On  December  5,  1870, a conveyance  was  executed  by	 theSecretary  of State in favour of the Justices of the  Peace.It was there stated, inter alia:"Whereas  the Honourable the Lieutenant Governor  of  Bengalhath thought fit that the said land so acquired as aforesaidwould  be vested in the said Justices of the Peace  for	 theTown of Calcutta a Corporation created by and authorised  tohold  land under the said Act No. VI of 1863 of the  Councilof the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal to the end and intent601that  the said land may be held by the said Justices  for  apublic	 purpose,  namely,  for	 the  conservancy   of	 theTown......... and subject in every way to the same' Act	 butfree  and discharged from all payment of land revenue,	landtax  and  all and every tax or imposition in the  nature  ofrevenue derivable from land payable to Government in respectthereof;  NOW THIS IN-DENTURE WITNESSETH.......to  hold	 thesaidpieces  of land, hereditaments and premises intended  tobe conveyed with the appurtenances except as aforesaid	untothe said Justices of the Peace for the Town of Calcutta	 andtheir  successors  for	ever free and  clear  and  for	everdischarged from all Government land revenue whatever or	 anypayment	 or  charge  in the nature thereof to  the  end	 andintent	that the said land may be used for a public  purposenamely	for the conservancy of the town upon the trusts	 andsubject	 to  the powers, provisions,  terms  and  conditionscontained  in the said Act No. VI of 1863 of the Council  ofthe   Lieutenant  Governor  of	Bengal	and  to	 the   rulesheretofore   passed  or	 hereafter  to	be  passed  by	 theGovernment  of	Bengal	under the the  said  last  mentionedAct;".On January 23, 1880, a temporary lease of the land known  asthe  'Square Mile' was granted by the Justices of the  Peaceto  the predecessors-in-title of the  appellant	 (assessee),Srish  Chandra Sen who has, since the filing of the  appeal,died, leaving behind 40 legal representatives who have	beenshown  in  the	cause title of the appeal.   The  lease	 wasrenewed	  for  further	periods,  and  the  rent  was	alsoprogressively  increased.  The conservancy arrangements	 forwhich  the land 'was held were carried out, but, the  lesseehad  the  right	 to carry on cultivation  with	the  aid  ofsewage.The assessee derived from this land various kinds of income,some  being purely agricultural and some,  non-agricultural.For  the  assessment year 1942-43,  the	 total	agriculturalincome was computed at Rs. 99,987-9-6, and  non-agriculturalincome,	 at  Rs. 12,503-8-0.   Agricultural  income-tax	 wascharged	 by  the  State of  Bengal  under  the	AgriculturalIncome-602tax Act, on the agricultural income less expenses.  For	 theassessment years, 1943-44, 1944-45, 1945-46 and 1946-47, theassessments  were  made along similar lines.  In  1947,	 theIncome-tax Officer reassessed the income for the  assessmentyear, 1942-43 after reopening the assessment under s. 34  ofthe  Income-tax	 Act  on  the  ground  that  the   so-calledagricultural  income  had escaped assessment  to  income-taxunder the Indian Income-tax Act.  Assessments for the  otheryears,	1943-44,  1944-45,  1945-46 and	 1946-47  were	alsoreopened,  and the income in those years wag also  similarlyreassessed.    The  assessee  appealed	to   the   AppellateAssistant  Commissioner	 against  all these  orders  of	 theIncome-tax  Officer,  but his appeals  failed.	Against	 theorders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, appeals werefiled  before  the Income-tax Appellate	 Tribunal  (CalcuttaBench).	 The Tribunal dealt with the assessment for  1942-43separately, and allowed the appeal as regards assessment forthat year.  It held that the reassessment was improper unders. 34 of the Income-tax Act, because the Income-tax  Officerhad  not  proceeded on any definite information but  in	 thecourse	of a "roving enquiry".	The Tribunal also held	thatthe  income was exempt from taxation to income-tax under  s.4(3)(viii)  of the Act, inasmuch as this income was  derivedfrom land used for agricultural purposes, which continued tobe assessed to land revenue.In the appeals arising out of assessments for the subsequentyears, a common order was passed by the Tribunal,  remandingthe  appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner  for  arehearing.   The  Tribunal stated that	the  appellants	 hadfiled  a number of documents to establish that land  revenuewas  assessed on the land which, the  Department  contended,proved	the  contrary.	The Tribunal felt  that	 the  mattershould	 be   reconsidered  by	 the   Appellate   AssistantCommissioner,  and hence remanded the cases.  The  AppellateAssistant  Commissioner in the rehearing held that the	landin question continued subject to land revenue, and that	 thelump  sum payment was merely payment of revenue in  advance.He accordingly allowed the appeals, and ordered exclusion ofthe income603from  the  assessments for the four years in  question.	  Onappeal by the Department, the Tribunal changed its  opinion,and  came to the conclusion that the' payment of a lump	 sumwas  not a payment in advance of the land revenue  due	fromyear to year but was land revenue capitalised.	It  referredto the deed by which the proprietorship in the land was ves-ted in the Corporation by the Secretary of State, and statedthat by the document and the capitalisation of land revenue,the  demand for land revenue was extinguished for ever.	  Itaccordingly allowed the appeals, and restored the orders  ofassessment made by the Income-tax Officer.The assessee next moved the Tribunal for a reference settingout a number of questions which, he contended, arose out  ofthe  Tribunal's order.	The Tribunal referred the  followingquestion of law for the opinionof the High Court:"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this	casethe Tribunal's conclusion that the land was not assessed  toland revenue within the meaning of s. 2(1)(a) of the  IndianIncome-tax  Act	 is justified?" The reference was  heard  byChakravarti, C. J., and Sarkar, J., (as he then was).  In anelaborate  judgment,  the learned Chief Justice	 upheld	 theconclusions  of the Tribunal, and answered the	question  inthe affirmative.  Sarkar, J., in an equally elaborate  orderexpressed  his	doubts about the correctness  of  the  ChiefJustice's reasons, but declined to disagree withhim.The question that arises in this case, as we have stated  inthe opening of this judgment, is a very short one.  It is anadmitted  fact that by payment of' a lump sum the  liabilityto pay land revenue was redeemed and no land revenue was de-manded	or  was ever demandable from the Justices  or  theirassigns	 in perpetuity.	 The contention of the	assessee  isthat  this redemption saved the Justices from the  liabilityfor payment but did not affect the assessability of the landto  revenue  under  Regulation I of  1793.   Unless,  it  iscontended,. there was a cancellation of the assessment,	 a,%is to be found in the604Land  Tax  and	Tithe  Redemption  Acts	 in  England,	 theliability  must be deemed% to continue and land would  stillbe  assessed to land revenue for purposes of s.	 2(1)(a)  ofthe Indian Income-tax Act.  That section reads as follows:"2(1) 'Agricultural income' means-(a) any rent or revenue derived from land which is used	 foragricultural  purposes,	 and  is  either  assessed  to	landrevenue	 in (the taxable territories) or subject to a  localrate assessed and collected by Officers of (the	 Government)as such".It is not denied that both the conditions, namely, "used foragricultural  purposes"	 and  "is either  assessed  to	landrevenue or subject to a local rate.............. have to co-exist.	 It is admitted by the Department that there  is  noquestion  of  subjection  to  a	 local	rate  assessed	 andcollected,  in this case.  The income derived from the	landwas  from its use for agricultural purposes, and  the  firstcondition is thus satisfied.  The dispute centres round	 thepoint  whether the land .can be said to be assessed to	landrevenue, in spite of the lump sum payment in 1865.In  the	 High  Court, the matter  was  examined	 from  threedifferent  points  of  view.  The first was  the  effect  ofacquisition  of	 the land by Government upon  the  continuedassessability  of  the land to land  revenue.	The  learnedChief  Justice held that by the acquisition  the  assessmentceased	to  subsist.   The  second was	the  effect  of	 theredemption  of	land revenue by the Justices by a  lump	 sumpayment.   The learned Chief Justice was of opinion that  ithad  the effect of cancelling the assessment.  The last	 wasthe effect of the grant free from land revenue, about  whichthe  learned Chief Justice was of opinion that it freed	 theland from assessment to land revenue.  Sarkar, J., agreed asto  the	 first, but expressed doubts about  the	 second	 andthird  propositions.   According to the learned	 Judge,	 theacceptance of a lump sum payment in lieu of recurring annualpayments was more a matter of agreement than a	cancellationof assessment to land revenue.The matter has been argued before us from the605argument  about	 the  interpretation to be  placed  on	the,conveyance  by	the Secretary of State which,  according  tohim, only freed the Justices from 'payment' of the  assessedland revenue but -did not cancel the assessment.No  Act of Legislature bearing upon the power of  Governmentto  accept a Iump sum payment in lieu of the annual  demandsfor  land revenue has been brought to our  notice.   Counseladmitted that they were unable to find any such	 legislativeprovision.  We have thus to proceed, as did the High  Court,without	 having	 before us the authority  of  a	 legislativeenactment.   The only materials to which reference was	madeare:  an extract from the explanatory notes in	the  RevenueRoll  of  the Touzi which shows that an	 abatement  of	landrevenue	  pro  tanto  was  granted  to	the  proprietor	  ofPanchannagram  Estate, and a despatch from the Secretary  ofState  for  India  (Lord  Stanley)-No.	2  (Revenue)   datedDecember 31, 1858-recommending redemption of land revenue byan immediate payment of a sum of equivalent value,  togetherwith  a Resolution of Government (Home Department  No.	3264(Rev)  dated October 17, 1861) on permission to	 redeem	 theexisting  land revenue by the immediate payment of  one	 sumequal in value to the revenue redeemed.	 By the	 resolution,it was provided that such redemption would be limited to  10per  cent of the total revenue in the Collectorate  and	 theprice  to be paid was to be fixed at 20 years'	purchase  ofthe  existing  assessment.   It may  be	 mentioned  that  inDespatch  No. 14 dated July 9, 1862, the Secretary of  Statefor India (Sir Charles Wood) did not agree with the  earlierpolicy, but did not cancel it.It  may	 thus be assumed that what was done  was  under	 theauthority  of  the Crown, which was  then  paramount,  whichparamountcy  included the prerogative to free land from	 thedemand of land revenue with or without conditions.  We have,therefore,   to	  examine  three  things:  the	 effect	  ofacquisition  on	 the continuance of the assessment  to	landrevenue,  the effect of redemption by a down payment on	 thesame,    77606and the effect of the grant, free from land revenue, to	 theJustices.The acquistion was under Act VI of 1857.  That Act  providedin B. XXVI as follows:"When any land taken under this Act forms part of an  estatepaying	revenue to Government, the award shall	specify	 thenet  rent of the land including the Government Revenue,	 andthe  computed  value of such rent: and it shall	 be  at	 thediscretion of the Revenue authorities either to pay over thewhole  of  such	 value to the owner of	the  estate  on	 thecondition of his continuing to pay the jumma thereof withoutabatement;  or to determine what proportion of the net	rentshall be allowed as a remission of revenue, in which case  adeduction shall be made from the said value proportionate tothe value of such remission."This  provision	 only  saved the  Estate  assessed  to	landrevenue	 from liability to pay land revenue  proportionatelyfalling	 upon the land acquired compulsorily, subject  to  alike  proportionate reduction in the amount of	compensationpayable	 to the proprietor of the estate, but the  provisioncannot	be stretched to mean that the liability of the	landactually acquired, to land revenue in the hands of  granteesfrom  the Government also ceased.  Be that as it may, it  ishardly necessary to view the present case from this angle atall,  because,	whether the land acquired  continued  to  besubject to an assessment or must be deemed to be  reassessedas  a  separate	 estate, the result would  be  the  same  ifGovernment  demand  still subsisted on it, as, in  fact,  itdid.   There could have been no redemption of the  liabilityby  a  down  payment  if no land  revenue  could  have	beendemanded.   The	 fact  that  the  recurring  liability	 wasredeemed by a lump sum payment itself shows that in the viewof Government as well as of the Justices, the 'Square  Mile'was still subject to the recurring demand and was thus stillassessed to land revenue.  It is, therefore, not  profitableto  investigate the effect of acquisition on  the  continuedliability of the land to land revenue between the time therewas acquisition and the vesting of the land in the Justices.-For the above reason, we need not examine at607length	the  case  in Lord Colchester v.  Kewnoy  where	 theacquisition  by	 the Crown was held not to  make,  the	areaacquired immune from land-tax, because the burden of the taxwould  then have fallen upon the remaining land situated  inthe  unit  from which it was acquired and on  which  unit  aquota of the land-tax was chargeable.  Such a position	doesnot  arise here, because the Panchannagram Estate was  givenabatement and a lump sum was paid to free the land  acquiredfrom the liability to land revenue.  Similarly, the decisionof  this  Court in The Collector of  Bombay  v.	 NusserwanjiRattanji Mistri and Others (2), where on the acquisition  ofsome Foras lands held under Foras Land Act (Bombay Act VI of1851)  the Foras tenure was declared to have come to an	 endand  on	 the  same  lands  being  resold  by  Government  asfreehold, they were declared not to be subject to assessmentto which they were previously subject, is not very helpful.There  do  not appear to be any rules prior to	1875,  whichwere framed under the Land Acquisition Act of 1870 (Act X of1870)  and which are to be found in the Calcutta Gazette  ofJuly  7,  1875, p. 818.	 If there were, they have  not	beenbrought to our notice.	But a practice similar to the  rulesseems  to  have obtained under s. XXVI of the Act  of  1857.That  Act  also	 did not contain any  provision	 for  makingrules,	as  are	 to  be found in  the  subsequent  Acts	 forcompulsory  acquisition	 of  land.  In the  absence  of	 anystatutory  law or rules, we must take the facts to  be	thatafter	acquisition  the  Panchannagram	 Estate	 was   givenabatement  of land revenue, and the demand for land  revenuewas  transferred  to the land acquired and  granted  to	 theJustices.   At	that  stage,  the  liability  to  assessmentremained, and it was that liability which was redeemed by  adown payment.We next consider the effect of redemption.  Learned  counselfor   the  appellant  contends	that  redemption   in	thisconnection means that by a single payment, the liability forperiodical payments is saved but the assessment on the	landremains uncancelled.  He has cited Wharton's Law Lexicon  toshow the meaning of(1) (1866) L.R. 1 Exch. 368.(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1311.608the   word  "redemption",  which  is  "commutation  or	 thesubstitution of one lump payment for a succession of  annualones:  e.g. See the Land Tax and the Tithe  Redemption	Actsand  many  other  statutes".   Redemption  is  the  act	  ofredeeming which in its ordinary meaning is equal to bringingoff a charge or obligation by payment.	To what extent	thisredemption freed the land or its holder from the  obligationdepends	 not  so much upon what the  obligation	 was  beforeredemption  as	what remained of that obligation  after	 it.Here,  the  payment  itself was meant to  be  "an  immediatepayment	 of one sum equal in value to the revenue  redeemed"(vide the Resolution of Government dated October 17,  1861).By the down payment, the entire land revenue to be recoveredfrom  that land was redeemed.  The payment was equal to	 thecapitalised value of the land revenue.	When such a  paymenttook  place, it cannot be said that the assessment for	landrevenue	 remained.  The land was freed from that  assessmentas completely as if there was no assessment.  Thenceforward,the  land would be classed as revenue-free, in fact  and  inlaw.  In The Land-Law of Bengal (Tagore Law Lectures,  1895)p.  81	S. C. Mitra described these  revenue-free  lands  asfollows:"There	is another class of revenue-free lands	which  comeswithin these rules laid down in the Registration and TenancyActs,	namely,	  lands	  of  which   Government   has,	  inconsideration  of the payment of a capitalised sum,  grantedproprietary  title  free in perpetuity from  any  demand  ofland-revenue."That  this is what had happened here is quite apparent	fromthe conveyance by the Secretary of State vesting the land inthe Justices.  It is significant that there is no mention ofthe  payment of Rs. 7,728-13-8, nor of the assessability  ofthe  lands to land revenue.  On the other hand, the deed  ofconveyance  merely  reaffirmed the position,  which  existedbefore by stating:"...to	hold  the  said pieces of  land,  hereditaments	 andpremises  intended  to be conveyed  with  the  appurtenancesexcept as aforesaid unto the said Justices of the Peace	 forthe Town of Calcutta and their successors for ever free	 andclear and for ever discharged609from all Government land revenue whatever or any payment  orcharge in the nature thereof."There  can  be no doubt that the land revenue was  for	everextinguished  and  the land became free from  land  revenue,assessment in perpetuity.  It cannot thereafter be said thatthe land was still assessed to land revenue.Mr. Mitra made a great effort to construe the operative partquoted above with the aid of the recital in the deed,  whereit was stated:"...but	 free  and  discharged	from  all  payment  of	landrevenue, land tax and all and every tax or imposition in thenature	 of   -revenue	derivable  from	 land	payable	  toGovernment......He drew attention to the word 'payment', and contended	thatwhat was saved was payment of land revenue.  He argued	thatin  case  of ambiguity it was permissible  to  construe	 theoperative  portion of a deed in the light of  the  recitals,and cited Halsbury's Laws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol.  XI, p.421,  para.  680,  Gwyn v. Neath Canal Co. (1)	and  Orr  v.Mitchell  (2).	If there was any ambiguity in the  operativeportion	 of  the  deed, we may have taken  the	aid  of	 therecitals.  But	there  is no ambiguity	in  the	 deed.	 Thehistory of redemption is a matter of record, and it is plainthat  Government  was accepting a down payment	and  freeingland  from land revenue.  This is precisely what  was  done,and  the  result of the down payment is set out	 with  greatclarity in the deed itself, and it is that there was no landrevenue assessed on or demandable from that land.  In  fact,no demand or payment or charge in the nature of land revenuecould  ever be made on it.  In view of this, it is,  in	 ourjudgment,  quite satisfactorily established that  this	landwas not assessed to land revenue and the income from it	 didnot  fall  within  s. 2(1)(a) of the  Income-tax  Act.	 Theanswer given by the High Court was thus correct.In the result, the appeal fails, and will be dismissed	withcosts.(1868) L R. 3 Exch. 209.				   Appeal dismissed(2)  [1893] A. C. 238, 254.610
