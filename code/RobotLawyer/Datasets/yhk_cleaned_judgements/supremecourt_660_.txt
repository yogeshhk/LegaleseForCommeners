A decree for payment  of  oweltymoney by one co-sharer to another in a Partition Suit,	evenwhere it does not expressly declare a charge, creates one bynecessary  implication	in  favour  of	the  latter  or	 theproperty allotted to the former and such charge on lien	 hasprecedence over prior mortgagees of such property.Shahebzada Mohommed Kazim Shah v.

Whether the final decree  had	or  had	 notcreated a charge over the insolvent's share for such sums asit  directed  the Receiver in insolvency to pay to  the	 co-sharer that could not affect the Receiver's liability to paythereunder  and	 while	the  decree  subsisted	he  was	 notentitled to claim restitution of such monies as he had	paidin  terms  thereof  on the ground that no  charge  had	beencreated nor any other claim to priority existed.The  rights of the co-sharer decree-holder who had  obtainedthe  decree  against  the  'Receiver  himself  stood  on   adifferent footing from those of a creditor of the  insolventand he could not, like the latter, be compelled to accept  adividend on the distribution of the insolvent's assets.776JUDGMENT:Civil APPFLLATE JURISDICTION  Civil Appeals Nos. 251 to	 253of 1953.Appeal	from the judgment and order dated February 8,  1950,of the Madras High Court in A. A. 0. Nos. 724 to 726 of 1945-preferred  against  the orders dated July 14,1945,  of	 theCourt of the District Judge, West Tanjore in E. P. No. 35 of1944  and E. A. Nos. 195 and 182 of 1944 respectively in  E.P. No. 15 of 1940 in 0. S. No. 22 of 1934 on the file of theCourt of SubJudge, Kumbakonam.N.   S.	 Chonpakesa  Aiyangar and S.  Subramanian,  for	 theappellant.The respondent did not appear.1957.  March 27.  The Judgment of the Court was delivered byBHAGwATI J.-These appeals with certificates of fitness underArt.  133 of the Constitution raise an interesting  questionas  to the equities arising out of a partition	between	 theerstwhile members of a joint family.A  suit for partition of the properties belonging to a	wellknown  Odayar family in the West Tanjore District was  filedin  the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Kumbakonam  (beingOriginal Suit No. 22 of 1924).	Amongst the parties to	thatsuit were defendants Nos. 3 and, 6, Balaguruawsmi Odayar andSwaminaths  Odayar respectively, the former of whom  is	 thenatural	 father	 of the latter, who went  by  adoption	intoanother branch of the family.  Defendant No. 6 was  entitledto  a  4/15th share and defendant No. 3 was  entitled  to  a2/15th	share  in  the properties belonging  to,  the  jointfamily.	  A preliminary decree for partition was  passed  onOctober25, 1924 The defendant No. 3 became insolvent  duringthe  pendency  of  an appeal which was	taken  against	thatpreliminary  decree.  The Official Receiver of West  Tanjorewho  represented  the  branch  of  the	3rd  Defendant	 wasimpleaded as a party to the suit on February 12, 1929.	 Thefinal  decree for partition was passed on September  26,1932by  the	 Subordinate Court at Kumbakonam.  Defendant  No.  6carried777an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Madras being A.S.  No.	 60 of 1933 and the High Court ultimately  passed  afinal decree on May 9, 1938.Under  the terms of this decree certain properties  fell  tothe share of the 3rd Defendant's branch and for the  purposeof  equalising	on partition the Official Receiver  of	WestTanjore, representing the 3rd Defendant's branch was orderedto pay a sum of Rs., 24,257-0-8 to the Defendant No. 6. Thisamount	was to carry interest at 6 per cent. per annum	fromSeptember  26,	1932,  and there  were	various	 adjustmentsordered inter se.  It was further ordered that the  OfficialReceiver  of  West  Tanjore in whom the estate	of  the	 3rdDefendant's  branch was vested should sell such portions  ofthe  estate  as	 were  not subject to  the  charge  for	 themaintenance  of	 the 9th Defendant in order to pay  off	 theamounts decreed to be paid by the third Defendant and shouldmake  payments	on behalf of the 3rd Defendant's  branch  inaccordance with thejudgment therein.,The last direction was given by the High Court in C.M.P. No.5697  of 1939 substituting the words " be. at liberty  "  inparagraph 4 (b) of the decree in A.S. No. 60 of 1933 by	 thewords " be directed " and in, corporating the words "  thirdDefendant's Branch " wherever the words " third Defendant  "had  been  used	 in that paragraph.  The  occasion  for	 thegiving of this direction was that after the final decree forpartition had been passed by the High Court on May 9,  1938,the parties applied to the High Court to give directions forworking	 out their rights inter -se.  When these  directionscame  to be given the Official Receiver of West Tanjore	 waspresent	 in  Court and stated to the Court that	 he  had  noobjection  to sell such portions of the estate as would	 be,sufficient  to pay off the amount declared due by the  thirdDefendant's  branch  to	 the  Defendant No.  6.	 It  was  inpursuance of such statement made by the Official Receiver ofWest Tanjore that the High Court did not declare a charge onthe  properties which had fallen to the share of  the  third100778Defendant's branch (as it was originally contemplated in thejudgment) for the amount of Rs. 24,257-0-8.The  Official Receiver of West Tanjore had in the  meanwhilesold on July 5, 1935, certain items Of properties which	 hadfallen	to  the	 share of the  3rd  Defendant's	 branch	 andrealised  a  sum  of Rs. 8,250.	 On January  25,  1940,	 theDefendant  No.	6  who is the appellant before	us  filed  apetition under 0. 21 r. 11 Sub-r. (2) of the Civil ProcedureCode  being  E.P.  No. 15 of 1940  praying  that  the  Courtshould'	 direct	 the  Official	Receiver  of  West   Tanjorerepresenting  the  3rd Defendant's  branch  (the  respondentbefore us) to pay to him or to deposit into court Rs.  8,250for  the realization of Rs. 36,983-9-6 which was the  amountdue  to him from the third Defendant's branch inclusive	 of,interest  as -per the decree of the High Court dated May  9,1938, in A.S. No. 60 of 1933.  The respondent did not opposethis  claim  of	 the appellant at  that	 stage.	  Two  otherdecree-holders,	  one  Thinnappa  Chettiar  and	 the   otherPalaniappa  Chettiar had obtained decrees against  DefendantNo.  3 and Defendant No. 4 on promissory notes	executed  bythe  latter on date March 14, 1925, the decree in favour  ofThinnappa Chettiar being dated August 15, 1929, and that  infavour of Palaniappa Chettiar being dated July 17, 1928.  OnJuly  3, 1955, Thinnappa Chettiar filed a petition under  0.29.  r. 11(2) 54, 62, 66 of, the Civil Procedure Code  beingE.  P.	No. 25 of 1935 praying for the	realisation  of	 Rs.35,224-2-6- by attachment and sale of immovable	 -propertiesbelonging  to  his  judgment-debtor.  On July  4,  1935,  heattached  the shares of the sons of the Defendant No. 3	 andDefendant No' 4 in these immovable properties but in so	 faras  the attachment was not levied the sales effected by	 therespondent on July 5, 1935, of the properties falling to theshare  of  the	third Defendant's branch  were	upheld.	  OnSeptember 30, 1935, Thinnappa Chettiar filed an	 applicationbeing  E. A. No. 376 of 1935 under section 151 of the  CivilProcedure  Code	 praying that a sum of	Rs.  6,600  realisedafter  the order of attachment obtained by him as  aforesaidbe sent for from the respondent and paid to him by means779of a cheque.  E. P. No. 25 of 1935 and E. A. No. 376 of 1935were  dismissed	 by the District Judge on August  14,  1937.Thinnappa  Chettiar  filed A. A. 0. Nos. 349 & 350  of	1937against	 these	orders	of the Dist.  Judge  and  on  August10,1939,  the  High  Court holding that	 the  leave  of	 theInsolvency Court was not necessary before these	 proceedingsin  execution had been taken, remanded both E. P. No. 25  of1935  and  E. A. No. 376 of 1935 to the District  Court	 fordisposal  according to law.  The learned District Judge,  inorder	to   avoid  conflict  of  decisions  and   to	savedifficulties  of  multiplicity of  proceedings	allowed	 theappellant to be made a party in E. P. No. 25 of 1935 and  E.A.  No. 376 of 1935 and Thinnappa Chettiar was made a  partyto  the	 proceedings la E. P. No. 15 of 1940.	The  learnedDistrict  Judge	 passed a comprehensive order in  all  thesethree  matters, viz., E.P. No. 25 of 1935, E.A. No.  376  of1935  and  E.P.	 No. 15 of 1940 which came  up	for  hearingbefore	him.   He held that even though the word  charge  assuch  had not been used in the High Court's decree in A.  S.No.60 of 1933 the directions given by the High Court to	 therespondent,  under the circumstances of the case, created  acharge	on  the properties which fell to the  share  of	 thethird Defendant's branch This was the basis of the  petitionwhich  had been filed by the appellant being.  E. P. No.  15of  1940  and the learned District Judge  observed,  "	Thisdirection  must	 be deemed to have been	 certainly  made  infavour of the 6th Defendant in order to see that he is	paidthe amount decreed in his favour by a Court Official who hadthe possession of the properties and with such guarantee theHigh  Court probably thought that it was quite	unnecessary,to expressly state that a charge has been created over theseproperties.  "The   learned  District	 Judge	accordingly   directed	 therespondent to deposit into Court to the credit of E. P.	 No.15  of 1940 the sale proceeds in question, viz., Rs.  8,250,minus his legitimate expenses for payment to the  appellant.E.  A.	No.  376 of 1935 was dismissed	with  costs  of	 therespondent and E. P. No. 25 of 1935 was adjourned to January21, 1942, for further pro.780ceedings with regard to other lots of properties.  ThinnappaChettiar  filed appeals against these orders being  A.A.  0.Nos. 229, 429 and 483 of 1942 in theHigh Court.In  the	 meanwhile,  on	 January  9,  1942,  the  respondentdeposited  a sum of Rs. 5,200 in Court to the credit of	 theappellant's  decree.   On  February  5,	 1940,	the  learnedDistrict Judge made a further order allowing the  respondentto sell the properties which he was directed to sell by	 theHigh  Court's  order dated May 9, 1938, in A. S. No.  60  of1933,  to pay the petitioner as directed by the	 High  Court:notwithstanding the attachment as was ordered in E. P.	 No.25 of 1935 and free of that attachment.	 On May, 11, 1942, a-sum  of  Rs,  5,500  being the	 sale  proceeds	 of  certainproperties  belonging  to the share of the  3rd	 Defendant'sbranch	was  adjusted by the appellant and  on	January	 23,1940, the respondent paid to the appellant a further  amountof  Rs. 26,966 adjusting a further sum of Rs. 11  for  costsdue by the appellant.The High Court disposed of the A. A. 0. Nos. 229, 429 &	 483of  1942  on November 5, 1943.	It held that  the  procedureadopted	  by  the  learned  District  Judge  of	  impleadingstrangers  as  parties	to the execution  petition  and	 theexecution applications before it could not be supported	 andordered that the appellant and Thinnappa Chettiar should  bedeleted	 from the array of parties in E.P. No. 25  of  1935,B.A. No. 376 of 1935 and E.P. No. 15 of 1940.  It also	heldthat no charge was created by the decree dated May 9,  1938,in  A.S.  No.  60  of 1933 in respect  of  the	sum  of	 Rs.24,257-0-8  awarded to the appellant under the	decree.	  Itobserved that " It is clear from the language used that	 thelearned judges who disposed of A. S. No. 60 of 1933 did	 notintend	to create a charge and the decree did not  have	 thelegal  effect  of creating a charge.  " In the	result,	 theHigh  Court  ordered  that the name  of	 Thinnappa  Chettiarshould be struck out from the, array of parties in E.P.	 No.15  of 1940 and the name of the appellant should  be  struckout  from  the array of parties in E.P. No. 25 of  1935	 andE.A. No. 376 of 1935 and further ordered that all the three781applications -be remanded to the lower Court for disposal onthe merits in the light of the observations contained in theorder.As  a result of the decision of the High  Court	 negativeingthe  appellant's claim to priority, the respondent filed  onJuly  29, 1944, E.A. No. 182 of 1944 praying that the  Courtdo issue a cheque for Rs. 5,200 deposited-by him on  January9,  1942.  On the 7th, August, 1944, the appellant,  in	 histurn-,	filed  an Application being E.A. No.  195  -of	1944praying	 that  the Court do issue a cheque  for;  Rs.  5,200deposited by the respondent as due to him under: the  decreedated  May 9, 1938.  While these applications were  pending,the  respondent filed a petition, being	 Execution  PetitionNo.  35 of 1944, on September 27, 1944, under ss.  1414	 and151  and  0. 21 r. 1 1 and 37 of the  Civil  Procedure	Codepraying that the Court do order payment by the appellant  tohim  of (1) the sum of Rs. 5,200 deposited by him, in  Courton  January 8, 1942, and claimed by him in E.A. No.  182  of1944;  (2)  sale  proceeds adjufsted, by  the  appellant  onMayll,1942 together with interest thereon at 6 per cent. perannum from May II, 1942, aggregating to Rs. 6,283-12-0;	 (3)the amount paid on June 23, 1942, by the appellant being Rs.26,966	and  (4) the amount adjusted by the  respondent	 forcosts  due by him on June 23, 1942, being Rs.  I 1, items  3and  4	aggregating  to Rs. 26,977  together  with  interestthereon	 from June 23, 1942, up to date at 6 per  cent.	 perannum amounting to Rs. 3,722-13-6.  Thus he claimed a sum ofRs. 42,183-9-6 in the aggregate from the appellant.All these matters-E.A. No. 182 of 1944 and E.A. No. 195,  of1944  and  E.P. No. 35 of 1944 we're heard by  the  DistrictJudge  on  July	 14,  1945.   The  learned  District   Judgeunderstood  the	 order of the High Court dated	November  5,1943,  to 'mean that the claim of the appellant to  prioritywas  still to be adjudicated upon.  He stated that all	thathad been held by the High Court was that the decree in	A.S.-No. 60 of 1933 did not have the legal effect of creating  acharge	in favour of the appellant and the question  whetherthe appellant was not entitled to priority in respect, of782his  claim  was	 not concluded by that	decision,  since  itdepended upon the circumstances and situation of parties  inthe first litigation itself (i.e., O.S. No. 22 of 1924, Sub-Court,	Kumbakonam and A.S. No. 60 of 1933, High Court)	 andthe  reasons which then led the Official Receiver,  who	 waspresent	 when the order was made in A.S. No. 60 of  1933  tosubmit	that  "he  was prepared to sell such  parts  of	 theestate	as  might  be necessary for  satisfying	 the  decreepassed	in favour of the appellant." On	 scrutinizing  thesefacts,	the  learned District Judge came to  the  conclusionthat  in respect of the sums due to him under the  partitiondecree,	 directed to be paid from the estate -of  the  thirdDefendant's  branch as equitable adjustment,  the  appellanthad really a superior title and, assuming for a moment	thatthe  direction	related	 instead  to  a	 specific  item	  ofimmovable  property, it was obvious that such an item  wouldnot have formed part of the estate in insolvency at all.  Inthe result he held that the respondent was not entitled;  torestitution  in	 respect  of  the  payments  made  and	 theappellant was clearly entitled to such amounts, and also  tothe  amount then in deposit since the estate  in  insolvencydid  not  itself comprise these assets in the  strict  legalsense.	 The applications E. P. No. 35 of 1944 and E.A.	 No.182 of 1944, were accordingly dismissed. E.  A.	 No. 195  of1944 was allowed and the appellant was declared entitled  tothe amount deposited in Court.The  respondent	 carried appeals to the High  Court  againstthese  orders of the District Judge being A.A.0.  Nos.	724,725  and 726 of 1945.  The High Court appreciated the  forceof  the	 arguments  advanced  before it	 on  behalf  of	 the-appellant  but	 felt itself bound by the  construction	 putupon  the judgment and decree by the High Court on  November5,  1953, observing that even if that construction were	 notstrictly  binding on it as a decision on a pure question  oflaw  in	 the  nature  of a  judicial  precedent	 by  anotherDivision Bench of that Court would undoubtedly be, it  wouldfeel  highly  loath to deny it the respect to which  it	 wasentitled at its hands in the interests of judicial comity,783whatever  be  the construction which it would  have  imposedupon  the same, had the question arisen for the	 first	timebefore	it.   It,  therefore, held that	 the  appellant	 wasdebarred by the principles of constructive res-judicata fromraising other grounds of priority or preference after remandwhich  had no relation to the decree which was the basis  ofthe E. P. No. 15 of 1940.  The High Court also expressed theopinion that even assuming there was no res-judicata in	 hisfavour,	 the  provisions of the	 Provincial  Insolvency	 Actbeing what they were, the appellant could claim no  priorityif  his position as a secured creditor as defined in s.	 (2)(e)  of the Act could not be sustained.	 A further  argumentwas  advanced  before  the  High Court and  it	was  that  aprovision  in a partition decree for a mere payment  by	 oneco-sharer  to another of a sum of money for equalisation  ofshares per se  constituted a charge by operation of law overthe share allotted to the sharer made liable for the paymentwithout	 any  creation	of charge by the  Court	 by  expresslanguage  or necessary implication.  The High Court  refusedto entertain that argument in view of the conclusion reachedby  it as above and also negatived the contention which	 wasurged  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  before  it  that	 theprovision for such payment in the partition decree was an  "owelty	provision  " observing that all that was  meant	 wasequality and all that the expression " owelty provision"  inthe  context  implied  was a  provision	 for  adjustment  orequalization  of  shares  and  no  more.   The	High   Courtaccordingly  came to the conclusion that the respondent	 wasentitled  to the restitution sought by him and	allowed	 the;appeals  with costs before it and in the Court below.	 Theorder of the learned District Judge was set aside, and E. P.No.  35 of 1944 and E. A.No. 182 -of 1944 were, allowed	 andE. A. No. 195 of 1944 was dismissed.The  appellant applied for and obtained from the High  Courtcertificates  of fitness under Art. 133 of the	Constitutionand that is how these appeals are before us. The  principal question which arises for our  determinationin these appeals is what was the nature of784the  rights  acquired  by the appellant	 in  regard  to	 thepayment of Rs. 24.257-0-8 and interest by the respondent  asrepresenting  the 3rd Defendant's branch under the  term  ofthe decree dated May 9, 1938, in A.S. No. 60 of 1933.It must be remembered that the decree was one for  partitionof the Properties belonging to the joint family of which theDefendant  No. 3 and the appellant were coparceners.   Whileeffecting  such	 a  partition it would not  be	possible  todivide	the properties by metes and bounds, there  being  ofnecessity  an  allocation of properties	 of  unequal  valuesamongst	 the members of the joint family.  Properties  of  alarger	value  might go to one member and  properties  of  asmaller value to another and, therefore, there would have tobe an ,adjustment of the values by providing for the paymentby the former, to the latter by way of equalisation of theirshares.	  This	position has been recognized in	 law  and  aprovision  for	such  payment is -termed  "a  provision	 forowelty or , equality of partition".  The followings  passagefrom  Story on Equity (Third Edition) page 277,	 para  6541,describes what happens' on a partition:-In  regard to partitions,there was also another	 distinct;.,ground upon which the jurisdiction Of courts of equity,	 wasmaintainable as it constituted a part of its appropriate andpeculiar  remedial  justice.  It is, that courts  of  equitywere  not  restrained, as ,courts of law were,	to  a  mere,partition  or allotment of the lands and 'other real  estatebetween the parties according to their respective  interestsin  the same, and having regard to the true  value  thereof;but  courts  of	 equity might, with a  view  to	 the  more-,convenient  and	 perfect,  partition  or  allotment  of	 thepremises,  decree  a pecuniary compensation to	one  of	 theparties	 for  owelty  or, equality of partition,  so  as  toprevent an injustice or avoidable inequality." 'Lawrence  -on	 Equity Jurisprudenoe (1929),  Vol.   I	 pp.1227, 1228, s. 1147, also contains the following passage:-,The  ordinary method of partition is to decree	 a  physicalseverance of the separate interests, no sale785being  authorised  unless  a fair,  partition  is  otherwiseimpossible, or at least prejudicial.  There was no power  ofjudicial  sale at common law.  The Court  ordering  physicalpartition may make its decree effective by compelling mutualconveyances  by the parties of their  respective  interests.Owelty of partition may be awarded to equalize the shares ofthe  parties,  and  may	 be decreed to	be  a  lien  on	 theexcessive  allotment.  Though only when necessary to a	fairpartition, and it should be employed as little as possible."This position has been summarized in Freeman's Cotenancy andPartition  (1886  Edition) page 676, para.  507,  under	 thecaption of "Owelty":-"  Owelty":  " When an equal partition cannot  be  otherwisemade, courts of equity may order that a certain 'sum be paidby  the party to whom the most valuable purpartly  has	beenassigned.   The	 sum thus directed to be paid  to  make	 thepartition  equal is called "owelty".  It is a lien  on	the'purparty  on  account  of which it was	granted.   "The	 lawcannot contemplate the injustice of taking property from oneperson and giving it to another without an equivalent, or  asufficient  security  for  it."	 The  lien  for	 owelty	 hasprecedence  over  prior mortgages and other  liens  existing'against the cotenant against whom the owelty was awarded."It is significant to note that this provision for owelty  isconstrued  as  a  lien which the co-sharer  who	 is  awardedowelty	is  deemed to acquire on an excessive  allotment  ofproperty  to  the other co-'sharer.  Owelty in	general	 andlien  therefor are thus described in Corpus Juris  Secundum,Vol. 68, s. 15:"Section 15.  Owelty and Lien Therefor(a)  In General.(b) Liens.(a)  In General.The parties to a voluntary partition may agree to pay oweltyto equalise the shares allotted.Owelty	is the. difference which is paid or secured  by	 onecoparcener  or	co-tenant  to another  for  the	 purpose  ofequalizing a partition.	 The power to award101786owelty	has,  from  the	 earlier  times,  been	regarded  asnecessary  to  the  act of partitioning	 property;  and	 theparties to a voluntary partition may agree to the payment ofowelty in order to equalize the shares allotted; and,  wherethe   matter  of  making  the  partition  is  delegated	  tocommissioners,	they  have the power to award  owelty  as  anecessary incident to the partition.(b) Liens.An  agreement  for owelty in a voluntary partition  of	landordinarily creates a lien or charge on the land.An agreement for owelty ordinarily creates a lien or  chargeon  the	 land taken under the partition, and this  lien	 mayexist  because of an express agreement between	the  partiesproviding for it or it may be implied in the absence of suchexpress agreement."It  therefore  follows that when an owelty is awarded  to  amember	on  partition for equalization of the shares  on  anexcessive  allotment  of  immovable  properties	 to  anothermember	of  the	 joint family such a,  provision  of  oweltyordinarily  creates  a lien or a charge on  the	 land  takenunder  the partition.  A lien or a charge may be created  inexpress	 terms	by the provisions of  the  partition  decreeitself.	 There would thus be the creation of a legal  chargein favour of the member to whom such owelty is awarded.	 If,however, no such charge is created in express terms, even sothe  lien may exist because it is implied by the very  termsof  the partition in the absence of an express provision  inthat  behalf.	The member to whom  excessive  allotment  ofproperty  has  been made on such partition cannot  claim  toacquire properties falling to his share irrespective ofor discharied from the obligation to pay owelty to the othermembers.  What he gets for his share is, therefore,the properties allotted to him subject to the obligation  topay   such  owelty  and	 there	is  imported  by   necessaryimplication  an obligation on his part to pay owelty out  ofthe  properties	 allotted to his share and  a  correspondinglien in favour of the members to whom such owelty is awardedon the properties which have fallen to his share.787"Not only is this the normal position on a partition  decreewhere there, is an unequal distribution of properties  amongthe   members  of  the	joint  family  but  even  where	  anencumbrance has been created on a member's share before	 thepartition is effected, the encumbrancer is postponed to	 themember	to whom such owelty is awarded under  the  partitiondecree.	 A lien or a charge created in favour of a member inregard to such owelty obtains precedence over an encumbranceand, there are authorities to show that such lien or  chargehas priority over an earlier mortgage.The  following	passage	 from  Mitra on	 the  Law  of  JointProperty & Partition in British India, Second Edition,	page414, enunciates the above position: "  You	 will  note that sums directed to be  paid  for	 thepurpose of equalizing the values of the shares are in  legallanguage  called  "  owelty."  The  Commissioners  have	  noauthority  without  express authorization by  the  Court  toaward this compensation. (See Rule 14, 0. XXVI, C. P. Code).Where  in  a  suit for partition the  decree  of  the  Courtdeclares  that any sum of money should be paid as owelty  byone co-sharer to another the court may direct such sum to bea  charge on the share allotted.  In such a case should	 theco-sharer  before  partition have created  any	mortgage  inrespect	 of his undivided 'interest prior to the  partition,the  charge  for the owelty will have  precedence  over	 themortgage.   Shahebzada	Mohammed Kazim Shah v.	R.  S.	Hill(1907) I.L.R. Cal. 388."To  the	 same effect is the passage in Mulla's	Transfer  ofProperty Act (4th Edition) at page 211 :"The  lien of a co-sharer for owelty money on  partition  isentitled  to  precedence over prior mortgagees	of  propertyallotted to the co-sharer who is liable to pay owelty ".Shahebzada Mohommed Kazim Shah v. R.S. Hill was a case wherethe  appellants had been awarded two sums of Rs. 37,000	 andRs. 9,500 by way of owelty on partition. At the date of	 thepartition there was(1)  I.L.R. (1907) 35 Cal. 388, 392, 393.788subsisting a mortgage on a portion of the propertywhich  was the subject-matter of partition and the  questionarose  whether	the  amounts awarded by	 way  of  owelty  onpartition were entitled to priority over the mortgagees.  Itwas observed by Maclean C. J. in hi judgment:"Then  arises the question of priority.	 To  determine	thatquestion  it  becomes necessary to ascertain  what  was	 thesubstituted  property  which the mortgagor  took  under	 thepartition.   It is clear that all he took was the house	 No.52-2  Park Street, subject to the charges of Rs. 37,000	 andRs.  9,500 in favour of the appellants; and it can  only  beupon that, that the Roy mortgagees can rank as mortgagee s.,that  is, upon No. 52-2 Park Street subject to	the  chargescreated by the decree."Stephen	 J., who delivered a short but	concurring  judgmentadded:"  It is quite plain that the appellant's claim, which is  acharge	upon the property, Constitutes a deduction from	 thecorpus	of the property and is not affected by any  dealingswith the possession of the property on which the decision ofthe Judge of the Court of the first instance is based."There  was  no	doubt on the facts of  this  case  a  chargeexpressly  created in favour of the co-sharer who  had	beenawarded	 owelty	 but that in our opinion does not  make	 anydifference to the position.  The moment there is a provisionfor  such owelty made in a partition decree, the  member  inwhose  favour that provision has been made is entitled to  alien  or a charge over the property which has fallen to	 theshare  of the member to whom property of a higher value	 hasbeen  allotted.	  If such a lien or a. charge  is  expresslydeclared, so far so good but even if it is not so  expresslydeclared, there is by necessary implication the creation  ofa  lien	 or a charge in his favour for the  amount  of	suchowelty.This  case was followed in Poovanalingam Servai	 v.Veerai(1)where Phillips J. observed as follows:"  There  can  be  no doubt that in  a	partition  suit	 allequities between the members of the coparcenary(1)  A.I.R. (1926) Madras 166.789should	be worked out allotting to each member the share  towhich he is equitably entitled.	 "After  quoting	the  passage  from  Freeman's  Co-tenancy  &Partition set out above, the learned Judge further observed:" Even if there is nonlegal charge,in the present case,	 yeton  equitable principles such a, charge can be enforced	 andwhen. it comes to partitioning the property between two	 co-tenants, this equity should in my opinion be enforced."The High Court in passing the order dated November 5,  1943,initially  went wrong in holding that no charge was  createdin  favour of the, appellant under the terms of	 the  decreedated  May  9, 1938, in A.S. No. 60 of 1933.  No  doubt	 thelegal  advisers of the appellants were responsible for	thisresult	in so far as they invited the Court to construe	 thedecree	as  creating  an express charge	 in  favour  of	 theappellant.  No such express charge could be spelt out of theterms of the decree and in so far as the High Court came  tothe  conclusion that no such express charge was	 created  infavour of 'the appellant, it was undoubtedly correct.	But,at  the	 same time, the High Court  should  have  consideredwhether	 by reason of the provision for owelty contained  inthe   terms   of   that	 decree,  there	  was,	 under	 thecircumstances,	by necessary implication a lien or a  chargecreated	 in favour of the appellant for the payment  of	 thesum  of	 Rs, 24,257-0-8 and interest out of  the  propertiesfalling	 to the share of the third Defendant is	 branch	 andtherein the High Court fell into an error.This error was gain repeated by the High Court while passingthe orders under appeal in A. A. 0. Nos. 724, 725 and 726 of1945.	The  question  which the High Court  ought  to	haveaddressed to itself was whether in spite of the fact that noexpress charge was created in favour of the appellant  underthe  terms of the decree dated the 9th May' 1938, in  A.  S.No.  60	 of  1933  for the payment  of	Rs.  24,257-0-8	 andinterest  out of the properties falling to the share of	 the3rd Defendant's branch, there was by necessary implication ahen or a charge created for payment of that sum by reason790of  the provision for owelty having been made in  favour  ofthe appellant by way of equalization on partition.  Even  ifno express charge was created there was in equity a lien  ora  charge created on the Properties falling to the share  ofthe  third  Defendants	branch and he did  not	acquire	 theproperties  which  fell	 to  his  share	 on  such  partitionirrespective  of or discharged from the obligation  to	makepayment of such sum out of the same.  The appellant was,  inour opinion, entitled to payment of the sum of Rs. 24,257-0-8 and interest out of the properties which fell to the shareof the third Defendant's -branch on partition and which cameto  the	 possession  of	 the respondent	 by  reason  of	 theinsolvency of Defendant No. 3.This position was rightly appreciated by tile learned  Dist.Judge  when he passed orders in favour of the  appellant  onJuly 14, 1945.	The following passage from his judgment,  inour  opinion,  truly reflects the position  as	it  obtainedbetween the appellant and the respondent:"When	we  scrutinise	these  facts,  the   conclusion	  isinevitable that the claim of the Respondent to thepresent amounts stands even higher than on the basis of 'thepriority of a charge created in insolvencyadministration,	 whether  by  virtue of a "  security  ",  acharge created by an act of Court or a " lien " arising fromthe  operation of any law or statute.  In fact, it Could  becontended  with, great force that the estate  in  insolvencywhich vested in the hands of the Official Receiver consistedof  certain immovable properties minus the. sum directed  tobe  paid to the present Respondent by the sale of  availableportions of the estate as undertaken by the Official ReceiveI  r himself.  This was because 0. S. No. 22 of 1924 on	 thefile of the Kumbakonam Sub-Court was a suit of partition  inwhich  the  present Respondent was a  sharer  and  partner,,exactly	 as the 3rd Defendant's branch	represented  anothershare.	In decreeing the suit, equities arose for adjustmentas  between the several sharers, and it was found  that	 the3rd Defendant's branch was liable to the present  Respondentin  respect  of	 certain overdrawals of	 the  3rd  Defendantduring791the  minority  of  the Respondent,  and	 for  certain  leaseamounts	 due.	The Official Receiver  represented  the	 3rdDefendant's branch in the: appeal, since the insolvency	 hadsupervened.   The  matter-would	 at  once  be  cleared	fromdifficulty  if	we assume -that the decree  had	 dealt	withactual	sums of money instead. of immovable properties.	  Itwill be, obvious, in such a case that the estate which wouldhave  vested in the Official Receiver after the A  appellatedecree,	 for  administration  in Insolvency,  would  be	 theamount or amounts assigned to the branches of the 3rd Defen-dant  and  plaintiff  at  partition,  as  &hares,  deductingamounts	 payable to other co-sharers including	the  presentRespondent.   Merely because the estates actually  consistedof immovable properties while the claim of a co-sharer	likethe present Respondent to an adjustment on grounds of equitywas recognized in the form of a direction to pay, by sale ofa  necessary portion of the estate. the central fact of	 thesituation  is  not  changed.  In other	words,	the  presentrespondent  cannot  be really classed as a creditor  of	 theinsolvent's  branch at all.  In respect of the sums  due  tohim under the partition decree, directed to be paid from theestates	 of  the Plaintiff and 3rd Defendant'  as  equitableadjustment, he has really superior title, and, assuming	 fora  moment that the direction related instead to a  specific.item of immovable property, it is obvious. that such an itemwould  not-have formed part of the estate in  insolvancy  atall.   As  Mr.	T. S Krishnamurthi Ayyar  for  the  officialReceiver has frankly conceded, it is a well-known  principlethat  in suits for partition the shares are  first  assignedupon  the  "simple  basis  of  division	 for  administrativeconvenience,  claims inter se being worked out	by  specificdirections for payment.	 Nevertheless, in a law and in fact,the  shares actually derived by the parties to the suit	 arethose  subject	to or qualified by the	directions  made  inadjustment."If this was the true position as it obtained, and we are  ofthe  opinion  that  it was, then, the  orders  under  appealpassed	by the High Court were clearly wrong.  There was  nojustification for the respondent to ask792for  a	withdrawal  of the sum of Rs.  5,200  which  he	 hadearlier deposited into Court on January 9, 1942, or for	 therestitution of the sums of Rs. 5,500 and Rs. 26,966 and	 Rs.11 together with interest thereon as claimed.  These  monieshad  been  paid	 by  the  respondent  in  pursuance  of	 thedirections contained in the decree dated May 9, 1938, in  A.S. No. 60 of 1933 and they had been rightly paid by him	 andthey'  could  never be the subject-matter of  any  executionproceedings  as initiated by him.  Apart from  the  questionwhether a. 144 read with s. 151 of the Civil, Procedure Codewas at all applicable in the circumstances of this case,  weare of the opinion that the claim made by the respondent forthe  aforesaid	sums  was absolutely  unjustified.   We	 areaccordingly  of	 the opinion that the orders passed  by	 theHigh  Court in A. A. 0. Nos. 724, 725, add 726 of 1945	werewrong and should be reversed.The respondent wrote on November 21, 1953, to the  Registrarof  this  Court to say that none of the creditors  had	comeforward	 to  finance  the defence of  the  appeals  and	 theInsolvency  Court, i.e., the Sub-Court, Tanjore had  orderedthat the matters might be left undefended, as the' funds  inthe  estate were insufficient to' defend the appeals at	 thecost of the estate.  He,, therefore, requested that when theappeals	 were' heard and decided a direction might be  givenby  this  Court	 that there should be  no  Order  for  costsagainst	 him.	We  do	not, gee, how  we  can	absolve	 therespondent  from  liability  to pay  the  costs	 which	mustnormally follow the event.We  accordingly order that the appeals will be allowed;	 theE.  P. No. 35 of 1944 and E. A. No. 182 of 1944	 will  standdismissed;  E. A. No. 195 of 1944 will be allowed;  and	 therespondent   will  pay	the  appellants'  costs	  of   theseproceedings  throughout	 in  this Court as well	 as  in	 thecourts below.This separate Judgment of the Court was delivered by793SARKAR J.-These appeals arise out of ajudgmentof the High Court at Madras setting aside ajudgmentof the District Judge of West Tanjore bywhich thelearned	 District  Judge disposed of three  applications  incertain	 execution proceedings.	 The facts leading to  theseapplications were as stated hereunder.There  was a suit for the partition of properties  belongingto  a family of Odayars.  The suit was numbered Suit No.  22of 1924 of the court of the Subordinate Judge of Kumbakonam.There was a number of parties to this suit, but of these  weare  only concerned with two, namely, Balagurusami, who	 wasdefendant No. 3 and Swaminathaudayar, who was defendant	 No.6. Swaminathaudayar is the appellant before us.	 On  October25,  1924, a preliminary decree for partition was passed  inthis  suit  by the learned Subordinate Judge.	One  of	 theparties	 to the suit appealed from that decree to  the	HighCourt at Madras.  While this appeal was pending in the	HighCourt, Balagurusami was adjudicated insolvent and  thereuponhis assets including his share in the properties which	werethe  subject matter of the partition suit became  vested  inthe Official Receiver, West Tanjore (hereinafter referred toas  the	 Official Receiver).  The Official Receiver  is	 therespondent in the appeals before us.  On February 12,  1929,an  order was made by the High Court in the  appeal  pendingbefore	it  adding  the Official Receiver  a  party  to	 thepartition  suit.  In due course the appeal was disposed	 of.The appeals before us are not concerned with the preliminarydecree and no further reference to it will be necessary.On  September  26, 1932, a final decree	 for  partition	 waspassed	by the learned Subordinate Judge to whom the  matterhad  come  back after the disposal of the  appeal  from	 thepreliminary  decree.   The  appellant  before  us  was	 notsatisfied  with the final decree and he preferred an  appealfrom it to the High Court at Madras.  That Appeal was markedA.S. No. 60 of 1933.  The High Court passed its judgment anddecree in that appeal on May 9, 1938, varying the decree  ofthe  lower court.  It is necessary to refer to	portions  ofthis decree102794of  the High Court because the question in this appeal	willturn  on  them.	 The decree made  the  following  provisionsamong others:(1)The Official Receiver of West Tanjore as representing thebranch of Balagurusami, the 3rd defendant do pay Rs. 24,257-0-8  to the appellant, the 6th defendant with interest at  6per cent. per annum from September 26, 1932.(2)The	Official  Receiver of West Tanjore in whom  the	 3rddefendant's estate is vested be directed to sell portions ofit in order to pay off the amounts decreed to be paid by the3rd defendant's branch and shall make payments on behalf  ofthe  3rd defendant's branch in accordance with the  judgmentherein.Sometime  prior	 to the passing of the final decree  by	 theHigh Court on May 9, 1938, one Thinnappa, a creditor of	 the3rd defendant, Balagurusami, who had obtained a money decreeagainst him in 1929, applied in execution of that decree forattachment  and	 sale of the shares of the sons of  the	 3rddefendant in the joint family properties.  This	 applicationhad  been  made on July 3, 1935, and marked E.P. No.  25  of1935.	An order for attachment was duly made in  favour  ofThinnappa  and	the  attachment was levied on  some  of	 theproperties on July 6, 1935.  In the meantime, onJuly  5,  1935, the Official Receiver had sold some  of	 theproperties  of Balaguruswami's branch in the course  of	 theadministration	in insolvency and had received Rs. 2,100  onJuly  5,  1935, and a further sum of Rs. 6,150 on  July	 18,1935.  On September 30, 1935, Thinnappa made an marked	E.A.No.  376  of 1935 for an order on the Official	Receiver  tobring  into court for payment to him a sum of Rs. 6,600	 outof  the sale proceeds received by the Official	Receiver  asearlier mentioned.  These two applications were dismissed bythe learned District Judge, West Tanjore who heard them,  onthe  ground  that  no leave had	 been  obtained	 to  proceedagainst	 the Official Receiver from the court in  charge  ofthe  insolvency proceedings.  Thinnappa appealed  from	thisorder of dismissal to the High Court at Madras and the	HighCourt set aside the order of dismissal and directed that theapplications be heard on their795merits as it was of opinion that no leave to proceed againstthe Official Receiver was necessary as execution was  soughtagainst	 the sons of the insolvent.  This order of the	HighCourt  was  made  on  August  10,  1939.   Before  the	 twoapplications,  however,	 could	again be  taken	 up  by	 theDistrict  Judge of West Tanjore for hearing,  the  appellantbefore	us on January 25, 1940, applied for an order on	 theOfficial Receiver to deposit into court the sum of Rs. 8,250being  the  entire sale proceeds of some of  the  propertiesbelonging  to  Balagurusami's  branch  received	 by  him  asearlier mentioned.  This application was marked E.P. No.- 15of 1940.  The learned District Judge of West Tanjore to whomthe  application had been made felt that the three  applica-tions,	two by Thinnappa being E.P. No. 25 of 1935 and	E.A.No.  376 of 1935 and one by the appellant being E.P. No.  15of  1940,  were	 best heard together  and  he  thereupon  onSeptember  13,	1941,  made  -certain  orders  whereby	 theappellant  was	made  a party to  the  two  applications  byThinnappa and Thinnappa was made a party to the	 applicationby the appellant.The  three  applications  thereafter  came  up	for  hearingtogether and were disposed of by one judgment passed by	 thelearned District Judge of West Tanjore on December 23, 1941.It  appears  to	 have  been  contended	before	the  learnedDistrict  Judge	 on  behalf of the  appellant  that  he	 wasentitled  to  the whole of the sale proceeds  as  the  finalpartition decree of May 9, 1938, had created a charge in hisfavour on the properties which had been allotted under it tothe Official Receiver as representing Balagurusami's  branchwhile  it  appears  to	have been  contended  on  behalf  ofThinnappa  that he had the first right to the sale  proceedsby  virtue  of his attachment.	The learned  District  Judgecame  to  the  conclusion that the decree of  May  9,  1938,created a charge in favour of the appellant and in that viewof  the	 matter,  he made an order  directing  the  OfficialReceiver  who was a party to all the three applications,  todeposit	 into court to the credit of the appellant the	saidsale  proceeds	amounting  to  Rs.  8,250  after   deductingthereout his expenses of the sale and dismissing Thinnappa'sapplication 796 E.  A.	No. 376 of 1935 for an order on	 theOfficial  Receiver to bring into court for payment to him  asum of Rs. 6,600 out of the said sale proceeds.	 With regardto  Thinnappa's	 application  E.  P.  No.  25  of  1935,  headjourned it till January 21, 1942, for further	 proceedingswith  regard to other properties.  As a result of  the	saidjudgment  of  the  learned District Judge  the	position  onDecember 23, 1941, was that the appellant was held to have acharge	on the properties allotted to the Official  Receiveras   representing  Balagurusami's  branch  for	the   amountdirected to be paid to him by the decree of May 9, 1938.  Inview  of  this	the Official Receiver on  January  9,  1942,deposited  in Court to the credit of the appellant a sum  ofRs. 5,200 out of the said sale proceeds, being the  proceedsof  the sale of the properties over which the appellant	 hadbeen  held to have a charge.  Basing himself upon  the	saidfinding	 of  a charge in his favour the	 appellant  made  anapplication on March 19, 1942, which was marked E. A. No. 34of  1942, for an order on the Official Receiver to sell	 theproperties  belonging  to  the branch  of  Balagurusami	 theinsolvent for the purpose of paying off the said charge.  OnFebruary  5,  1942, an order was made  on  this	 applicationgiving leave to the Official Receiver to sell the propertiesand to pay the appellant his decretal amount out of the saleproceeds.  It appears that thereafter in May and June, 1942,the Official Receiver paid various sums to the appellant  inrespect of the amount due to him under the decree either  incash or by adjustment, aggregating Rs. 32,477.Thinnappa  however  was disatisfied with the  order  of	 thelearned District Judge of December 23, 1941, and he appealedfrom  it  to the High Court at Madras. There  were  in	factthree  appeals	filed  by him as  the  order  covered  threeapplications.	These appeals were marked A.A.0.  Nos.	229,429  and 483 of 1942.  On November 5, 1943, the	 High  Courtdelivered  judgment allowing these appeals.  The High  Courtheld  that  the procedure adopted by  the  learned  DistrictJudge  in  making the appellant a party to  Thinnappa's	 twoapplications E. P. No. 25 of 1935 and E. A. No. 376 of	1935and Thinnappa a, party to the appellant's appli-797cation E.P. No. 15 of 1940 could not be supported.  The HighCourt  further held that the decree of May 9, 1938, did	 notcreate any charge on the properties of Balagurusami's branchin favour of the appellant.  In this view of the matter	 theHigh Court made an order striking out the name of  Thinnappafrom E.P. No. 15 of 1940 and the name of the appellant	fromE. P. No. 25 of 1935 and E.A. No. 376 of 1935, and remandingall  the three applications to the lower court for  disposalon the merits in the light of the observations contained  inthe order.In view of the aforesaid finding of the High Court that	 theappellant  did	not  have the charge  claimed  by  him,	 theOfficial  Receiver felt that he was entitled to	 restitutionfrom  the appellant of the sum of Rs. 32,477 paid to him  asearlier mentioned as a result of the finding of the  learnedDistrict Judge of December 23, 1941, of the existence of thecharge	and also to withdraw the sum of Rs. 5,200  depositedin  court  to  the  credit  of	the  appellant	in   similarcircumstances.	 He,  thereupon, on July 29, 1944,  made  anapplication, marked E.A. No. 182 of 1944, for an order	thatthe sum of Rs. 5,200 deposited by him in court on January 9,1942, to the credit of the appellant may be paid back to himand on September 27, 1944, made another ,application, markedE.P.  No. 35 of 1944, for an order on the Appellant  to	 payback to him the said sum of Rs. 32,477 paid to the appellantin  cash  and  by way of  adjustment  as  earlier  mentionedtogether with interest thereon amounting in the aggregate toRs.   36,983/9/6.   The	 appellant  in	his  turn  made	  anapplication on August 7, 1944, marked E.A. No. 195 of  1944,for payment to him of the said sum of Rs. 5,200 deposited bythe  Official Receiver in court on January 9, 1942,  to	 hiscredit.	  These three applications were disposed of  by	 thelearned District Judge of West Tanjore by one judgment datedJuly  14, 1945.	 The learned District Judge was of the	viewthat  all  that was held by the High Court in  its  judgmentdated  November 5, 1943, in the appeals marked	A.A.0.	Nos.229,  42  429 and 483 of 1942 was that the  final  partitiondecree	of  May 9, 1938, did not have the  legal  effect  ofcreating798a  charge in favour of the appellant but that  the  questionwhether	 the  appellant	 was not  entitled  to	priority  inrespect of his claim was not concluded by that judgment.  Inthis  view  of	the  matter he went  into  the	question  ofpriority  and  found  that the estate  in  insolvency  whichvested	in the Official Receiver under the decree of May  9,1938,  consisted of certain immovable properties  minus	 thesums directed to be paid under it and the Official  Receiverwas  not, therefore,. entitled to restitution in respect  ofthe  payments made by him to the appellant or to the  amountin deposit in court, since the	estate in insolvency did notcomprise  these	 monies	 in the	 strict	 legal	sense.	 He,thereupon, dismissed the Official Receiver's application forrefund	from the appellant, being E.P. NO. 35 of  1944,	 andhis application to be repaid the monies deposited in  court,being  E.A.  No. 182 of 1944, and  allowed  the	 appellant'sapplication  for  payment  to him of the sum  of  Rs.  5,266deposited in court, being E.A. No. 195 of 1944.	 The appealsto us arise out of these applications.The  Official Receiver appealed from the said judgment	July14, 1944, to the High Court at Madras and these appeals weremarked A.A.0. Nos. 724, 725 and 726 of 1944.  These  appealswere  decided  by  the	High Court  by	its  judgment  datedFebruary  8, 1950.  The High Court held that the finding  inthe judgment dated November 5, 1943, that the appellant	 hadno  charge  over the properties allotted to  the  branch  ofBalagurusami, might not be binding as a judicial  precedent,but  it	 had  to  be given effect to  in  the  interests  ofjudicial  comity-and  that  it	had  to	 be  held  that	 theappellant was not entitled to a charge.	 The High Court alsoheld  that  the judgment dated Novem. ber 5, 1943,  did	 notleave  it open to the appellant to urge any other  claim  ofpriority  as he had not done so on the earlier	occasion  inhis application, being E. P. No. 15 of 1940.  Therefore, theHigh Court came to the conclusion that the appellant was notentitled to any priority.  The High Court further held	thatin view of the provisions of the Provincial Insolvency	Act,the  Appellant	could claim no priority if his	claim  to  acharge under the decree of May 9, 1938, failed799and  that such claim failed as it bad been rejected  by	 theearlier	 judgment of the High Court dated November 5,  1943,which  judgment	 had  to be  accepted  for  reasons  alreadystated.	  Lastly, the High Court held that the reasoning  ofthe  District Judge of West Tanjore that what vested in	 theOfficial  Receiver were certain immovable properties of	 theinsolvent  minus the sums directed by the decree of  May  9,1938,	to  be	paid  was  much	 too  artificial   and	 wasunsustainable.	 It  held  that the  Official  Receiver	 wasentitled to refund from the appellant and to be paid out themonies	deposited  in court and that the appellant  was	 notentitled to the latter sum.  In view of these findings,	 theHigh Court allowed the appeals marked A. A. 0. Nos. 724, 725and 726 of 1945.  From this judgment the appellant  appealedto  this Court and these are the appeals now before  us	 forhearing.In my view these appeals must be allowed.  The decree of theHigh Court of May 9, 1938, directed the Official Receiver topay monies to the Appellant.  That decree is binding on	 theOfficial  Receiver.  The Official Receiver has to  carry  itout.  He has carried it out and paid monies under it to	 theAppellant and deposited to his credit in court a sum of	 Rs.5,200.	 The Official Receiver cannot be heard to  say	thatthe  monies should be refunded to him because no charge	 hadbeen created over the insolvent's estate in respect of	themor  because  the appellant was not entitled  for  any  otherreason to a priority in payment.  Whether a charge had	beencreated	 or  not, or a right to priority exists or  not,  isirrelevant.  It is enough that there is a decree against theOfficial Receiver to pay the monies.  In making the  paymentthe Official Receiver has carried out his obligations  underthe  decree.   The decree stands and he has,  therefore,  noright  to recover the payments made.  The Official  Receiverasked  for the order for refund under s. 144 of the Code  ofCivil  Procedure.  But that section only applies where	pay-ments  have  been  made under a decree which  is  varied  orreversed.   That  is not the case here.	 Here  the  paymentshave  been  made  in satisfaction of a	decree	which  stillstands and indeed is one which has never been attacked.It  is	again  not a case where it could be  said  that	 theappellant  is entitled only to a dividend in respect of	 thedecretal  claim	 in  the  distribution	of  the	 insolvent'sestate.	  That	might have happened if the appellant  was  acreditor of the insolvent.  Here, however, he is a  creditorof  the Official Receiver himself.  The	 Official  Receiver,therefore,  cannot  claim either that the  appellant  shouldrefund the payments made to him, so that the monies refundedalong  with other available assets of the insolvent  may  bedistributed  pro rata among the creditors of the  insolvent,including the appellant.The  finding by the High Court in its judgment	of  November5,1943, that the appellant was not entitled to a charge	 andthe  acceptance of that finding by the judgment	 from  whichthese appeals arise make no difference, for the right of theappellant  to receive the monies or to retain what has	beenpaid to him does not depend on the existence of a charge  inhis  favour but on the existence of the decree.	 It  is	 notnecessary  to decide the question whether the appellant	 hassuch  a	 charge and I do not feel called 'Upon to  make	 anyobservation with regard to it.	I wish, however, to say thatthe decision of November 5, 1943, has no operation by way ofresjudicata  in	 favour	 of the appellant  and	against	 theOfficial Receiver.  That decision was between Thinnappa	 andthe appellant.	Though the Official Receiver was a party  tothe proceeding in which the decision was given, the issue asto whether there was a charge in favour of the appellant  ornot  was  not  between	him  and  either  the  appellant  orThinnappa,  nor was it necessary to decide an issue  betweenthe Official Receiver and the appellant as to the  existenceof  the charge in order to give Thinnappa or  the  appellantthe reliefs they respectively claimed.The  appeals  should,  therefore,  be  allowed	with   coststhroughout, and I order accordingly.Appeals allowed.801
