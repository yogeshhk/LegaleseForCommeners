(2) of the Act.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 327 of 1959.Appeal	from  the order dated June 28, 1956, of	 the  BombayHigh Court at Nagpur in Misc.  First Appeal No. 15 of 1954.98774A.   V.	  Viswanatha  Sastri,  Shankar	Anand  and   A.	  G.Batnaparkhi, for the appellant.K. N. Rajagopal Sastri, as amicus curiae.1960.  November 29.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbySHAH, J.-Ramachandra Dhondo Datar-hereinafter referred to asthe respondent-was employed by the appellant company in	 itspublications branch.  By agreement dated March 23, 1943, theappellant  company agreed to pay to the respondent  as	fromApril 1, 1943, remuneration per annum equal to 3 1/2% of thegross  sales  or  Rs. 12,000  whichever	 was  greater.	 Theagreement  was	to remain in operation for -ten	 years	fromApril  1, 1943, in the first instance and was  renewable  atthe option of the respondent for such period as he  desired.By notice dated April 19, 1948, served on the respondent  onApril  22,  1948,  the	appellant  company  terminated	 theemployment  of the respondent.	The respondent then filed  acivil  suit  in the court of the Fifth	Additional  DistrictJudge,	Nagpur,	 for  a decree for Rs.	1,30,000  being	 theamount	 of   compensation  for	 wrongful   termination	  ofemployment,  arrears  of salary and interest.  On  July	 17,1953, the court after giving credit for the amount  receivedby the respondent passed a decree for Rs. 42,359 (which	 wasinclusive  of Rs. 36,000 as compensation for termination  ofemployment  and	 Rs. 6,000 as salary in lieu of	 six  monthsnotice	and  interest) and costs and interest  on  judgment.The respondent then applied for execution of the decree	 andclaimed Rs. 54,893-12-0 less Rs. 18,501-10-0 decreed againsthim  in	 a cross suit filed by the appellant  company.	 TheIncome	Tax Officer, Nagpur, served a notice under s. 46  ofthe Indian Income Tax Act upon the respondent and also	gaveintimation to the District Judge, Nagpur, that the appellantcompany be permitted to deduct at source and to pay into theGovernment Treasury Rs. 15,95613-0 as income-tax,  surchargeand  super-tax due on the sum of Rs. 50,972-2-0	 awarded  tothe respondent.	 The appellant company also applied that the775executing  Court do declare that the appellant	company	 wasentitled  and  in  law bound to deduct the tax	due  on	 theamount.	 The learned Judge directed the appellant company topay to the Income Tax Department Rs. 15,956-13-0 on  accountof  income-tax	and  super-tax	on the	amount	due  to	 therespondent and directed it to pay the balance in court afterfiling	a  receipt for payment of tax from  the	 Income	 Taxdepartment.   In appeal to the High Court of  Judicature  atNagpur, the order passed by the District Judge was  reversedand execution as claimed by the respondent was directed.The  appellant company contends that under s. 18(2)  of	 theIncome	Tax Act, it was bound to deduct the tax computed  atthe appropriate rate on the salary payable to the respondentas  the	 amount	 due under the	decree	represented  salary.Section 18 sub-s. (2) of the Income Tax Act in so far as  itis  material  provides	that any person	 paying	 any  amountchargeable  under the head "salaries" shall at the  time  ofpayment	  deduct  income-tax  and  super-tax  at  the	raterepresenting  the  average of the rates	 applicable  to	 theestimated  total  income  of the  assessee  under  the	head"salary".   Sub-s.  (7) declares that a	 person	 failing  todeduct the taxes required by the section shall be deemed  tobe  an	assessee  in default in respect of  such  tax.	 TheLegislature  has, it is manifest, imposed upon the  employerthe  duty  to deduct tax at the appropriate rate  on  salarypayable	 to the employee and if-he fails to do so,  the	 taxnot  deducted may be recovered from him.  But the  liabilityto deduct arises in law, if the amount is due and payable assalary.	  In this case, there has been no assessment of	 taxdue  by the Income Tax Officer on the amount payable to	 therespondent.  Under s. 46(5), any person paying salary to  anassessee may be required by the Income Tax Officer to deductarrears of tax due from the latter and the employer is boundto  comply  with such a requisition and to  pay	 the  amountdeducted  to the credit of the Government.  But	 this  ordercan  only be passed if income-tax has been assessed and	 hasremained unpaid.  It is undisputed that at the, material776time,  no  tax	was assessed against  the  respondent;	-theIncome	Tax Officer had accordingly no authority to issue  anotice	under  s. 46(5).  Nor could the Income	Tax  Officerclaim to recover tax due by a proceeding in the nature of  agarnishee  proceeding  by  applying to the  civil  court  toattach	the  Judgment-debt  payable  by	 the  company.	 Theapplication  submitted	by  the	 Income	 Tax  Officer	musttherefore be ignored.  Undoubtedly, the employer is by s. 18of  the Act liable to deduct from the salary payable by	 himto his employee the amount of tax at the average rate appli-cable to the estimated total income; but can it be said thatas  between  the appellant company and	the  respondent	 thedecretal  amount  represented salary?	The  respondent	 hadfiled	a  suit	 for  a	 decree	 for  arrears	of   salary,compensation  for  wrongful termination	 of  employment	 andinterest.   The court having passed a decree on that  claim,it  became  a judgment-debt.  It may have been open  to	 theappellant  company  in the suit to apply to  the  court	 formaking	a provision in the decree for payment of  income-taxdue by the respondent, but no such provision was made.We are not concerned to decide in this appeal whether in thehands  of  the respondent the amount due to  him  under	 thedecree, when paid, will be liable to tax; that question doesnot  fall to be determined in this appeal.  The question  tobe  determined is whether as between the  appellant  companyand  the  respondent  the amount decreed is  due  as  salarypayment of which attracts the statutory liability imposed bys. 18.	The claim decreed by the civil court was for compen-sation,	 for wrongful termination of employment, arrears  ofsalary, salary due for the period of notice and interest andcosts,	less withdrawals on salary account.  The amount	 forwhich  execution  was  sought to be levied  was	 the  amountdecreed against which was set off the claim under the cross-decree.	   A   substantial  -part  of  the   claim   decreedrepresented   compensation  fir	 wrongful   termination	  ofemployment  and	 it would be difficult to predicate  of	 theclaim  sought  to  be  enforced what  part  thereof  if	 anyrepresented salary due.	 Granting that compensation  payableto an777employee   by  an  employer  for  wrongful  termination	  ofemployment be regarded as in the nature of salary, when	 theclaim  is  merged  in the decree of the	 court,'  the  claimassumes	 the character of a judgment-debt and  to  judgment-debts s. 18 has not been made applicable.  The decree passedby  the	 civil	court  must  be	 executed  subject  to	 thedeductions  and	 adjustments permissible under the  Code  ofCivil  Procedure.   The	 judgment-debtor may, if  he  has  across-decree  for  money, claim to set off  the	 amount	 duethereunder.   If there be any adjustment of the decree,	 thedecree may be executed for the amount due as a result of theadjustment.   A	 third	person who  has	 obtained  a  decreeagainst	 the judgment-creditor may apply for  attachment  ofthe  decree and such decree may be executed subject  to	 theclaim  of the third person: but the  judgment-debtor  cannotclaim  to  satisfy,  in the absence of a  direction  in	 thedecree	to that effect the claim of a third  person  againstthe  judgment-creditor, and pay only the balance.  The	rulethat the decree must be executed according to its tenor	 maybe modified by a statutory provision.  But there is  nothingin  the	 Income	 Tax Act which supports	 the  plea  that  inrespect	 of the amount payable under a judgment-debt of	 thenature	sought	to be enforced, the debtor  is	entitled  todeduct	income-tax which may become due and payable  by	 thejudgment-creditor  on the plea that the cause of  action  onwhich  the decree was passed was the contract of  employmentand  a part of the claim decreed represented amount  due  tothe employee as salary or damages in lieu of salary.Counsel	 for the appellant company strongly relied upon	 thedecision  of the House of Lords in Westminster Bank Ltd.  v.Riches	(1).  That was a case in which in an action  broughtby one R against the Westminster Bank trustee of the  estateof  one X-R was awarded a decree for pound 36,255  principaland  pound 10,028 as interest.	The Bank thereafter  broughtan action for a declaration that it had satisfied the  judg-ment in the action by R by paying him the amount(1)  18 Tax Cases 159.778due less pound 5,014, the latter sum representing income-taxon  the interest awarded by the judgment.  It was   held  bythe House of Lords that pound 10,028 was "interest of money"within Schedule D and General Rule 21 of the Income Tax Act,1918, and that income-tax was deductible therefrom.  In thatcase,  the only argument advanced on behalf of the  Bank  isset out in the speech of Viscount Simon, L. C. at p. 187:"The  appellant	 contends that the additional sum  of  pound10,028	though awarded under a power to add interest to	 theamount	of  the	 debt, and though  called  interest  in	 thejudgment,  is  not really interest such as  attracts  IncomeTax, but is damages.  The short answer to this is that thereis no essential incompatibility between the two conceptions.The real question, for the purposes of deciding whether	 theIncome	Tax Acts apply, is whether the added sum is  capitalor income, not whether the sum is damages or interest."The  House  of Lords in that case by a	majority  held	thatpound  10,028  awarded under the  judgment  represented	 notcapital	 but interest and was liable to tax.  In our  view,'this  case  has no application to the facts of	the  presentcase.	In the case before us, there is a decree  passed  infavour	of  the respondent: under the scheme  of  the  CivilProcedure Code, that decree has to be executed as it stands,subject to such deductions or adjustments as are permissibleunder  the  Code.   There was no  tax  liability  which	 therespondent  was	 assessed to pay in respect of	this  amounttill  the  date on which the -appellant	 company  sought  tosatisfy	 the  alleged tax liability of the  respondent.	  Asbetween the appellant company and the respondent, the amountdid not represent salary; it represented a judgment-debt andfor payment of income-tax thereon, no provision was made  inthe decree.  The Civil Procedure Code bars an action of	 thenature	which was filed in Westminster Bank's case  (supra).The  defence to the execution if any must be raised  in	 theexecution  proceeding  and not by a  separate  action.	 Theamount	payable by the appellant company to  the  respondentwas  not salary but a judgment-debt, and before paying	thatdebt the appellant company could not claim779to  deduct  at source tax payable by  the  respondent.	 Norcould the appellant company seek to justify its plea on	 theground	that the judgment-creditor was indebted to  a  thirdperson.The principle of the case in Manickam Chettiar v. Income TaxOfficer, Madura (1), on which reliance was also sought to beplaced	by the appellant company has no application to	thiscase.	In Manickam Chettiar's case (1), in execution  of  amoney  decree  certain properties belonging to	a  judgment-debtor	were  attached and sold and the sale  proceeds	werereceived  by  the  court.  The Income Tax  Officer  who	 hadassessed  the  decree-holder to tax payable by	him  on	 hisother  income  applied to the court for an  order  directingpayment	 to  him  out of the sale  proceeds  the  amount  ofincome-tax  due by the decree-holder.  It was held that	 theclaim for income-tax was entitled to priority in payment andthe  court  had	 inherent  power to make  an  order  on	 theapplication for payment of money due as income-tax.  Tax hadadmittedly been assessed, and proceedings substantially	 forrecovery  of the tax so assessed were adopted by the  IncomeTax  Officer.	It was held in the  circumstances  that	 thecourt had jurisdiction to direct recovery of tax out of	 theamount	standing  to the credit of the	decree-holder.	 Theprinciple of that case can have no application to the  factsof the present case.The respondent had not appeared before us, but we have	beenassisted by Mr. Rajagopala Sastri and we are indebted to himfor placing the evidence and the various aspects of the caseon  a true appreciation of which the question in issue	fellto be determined.The  appeal  fails  and	 is  dismissed.	  As  there  was  noappearance  for the respondent, there will be no  order	 forcosts.			    Appeal dismissed.(1) VI I.T. R. 180.780
