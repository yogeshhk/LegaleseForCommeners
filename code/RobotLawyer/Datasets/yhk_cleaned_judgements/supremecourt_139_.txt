The United  Statesof Rajasthan became State of Rajasthan, a Part B State.	 TheIndian	Finance Act, 1950, made the Indian  Income-tax	Act,1922, applicable to Part B States with effect from April  1,1950,  whereupon Rajasthan became a taxable territory.	 TheIncome-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, amended s. 14(2)(C) of theIndian	Income-tax  Act,  1922.	  Thereupon  the  Income-taxauthorities  sought  to tax the profits and  income  of	 theappellant  for	the  assessment	 year  1950-51	who  claimedexemption  under s. 14(2)(C) of the Indian  Income-tax	Act,1922, as it stood before the amendment in 1953. The questionfor  decision  was whether in view of the decision  of	thisCourt  in  Madan  Gopal's  case it was	still  open  to	 theappellant to contend that the amendment operated from  April1, 1950 and that income accrued prior to April x, 1950,	 wasstill exempt although the exemption was withdrawn only	fromApril 1, 1950.Held, that the withdrawal of the exemption in the assessmentyear 1950-51 conversely affected the income of the  previousyear 1949-50.  The application of the Indian Income-tax	 Actmade  Rajasthan	 a taxable territory subject to	 the  IndianIncome-tax  law and Parliament was competent to enact a	 newlaw  for the area, just as it did for the whole of the	restof India.The  fiction in the amendment made in s. 14(2)(C)  made	 theexemption in respect of liability to tax the income for	 theyear  1949-50 to disappear as if it had never  been  grantedand obliterated the exemption.	The whole purpose and intentof  the	 amendment  was	 to  reach  this  result  from	 theassessment  year  1950-51  onwards, and there  could  be  nosaving.	  The argument assumes the premise that the  Income-tax  Act was incorporated in the Indian Finance	 Act,  1950,but   there  is	 neither  precedent  nor  warrant  for	 theassumption  that  when one Act applies another Act  to	someterritory,  the latter Act must be taken to be	incorporatedin the former Act.  It may be otherwise, if there were wordsto  show  that	the earlier Act is to be deemed	 to  be	 re-enacted by the new Act.454Union  of  India v. Madan Gopal Kabra,	[1954]	S.C.R.	541,referred.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 26 of 1956.Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment and	Order  datedthe  22nd April, 1954, of the Rajasthan High Court  in	WritPetition No. 76 of 1951.N.   C. Chatterjee, J. B. Dadachanji and M. S. K.  Aiyangar,for the appellants.K.   N. Rajagopal Sastri and D. Gupta, for the respondents.1960.	August 31.  The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyHIDAYATULLAH J.-This is an appeal with the special leave  ofthis  Court  against  the  judgment of	the  High  Court  ofRajasthan dated April 22, 1954.	 The appellant is a  privatelimited	 Company,  which  was incorporated in  1945  in	 theformer	Kotah State.  The income-tax authorities  sought  totax  its profits and income for the assessment year  1950-51corresponding to the previous year, 1949-50.  The  appellantclaimed exemption under s. 14(2)(c) of the Indian Income-taxAct,  1922,  as	 it  stood before  the	amendment  in  1953,contending  that  the exemption stood good  even  after	 theamendment.  This claim was rejected by the High Court, whichwas  moved under Art. 226 of the Constitution.	 Hence	thisappeal.Prior  to  the integration of Kotah State  into	 the  UnitedState  of Rajasthan in 1949, there was no income-tax law  inforce  in Kotah State.	Till the formation of the  State  ofRajasthan,  there  was no such law in force in any  part  ofRajasthan,  except Bundi State.	 The Indian Finance  Act  of1950 made the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, applicable to thewhole  of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir,	 andsuitably amended the Indian Income-tax Act.  Rajasthan	thenbecame, from April 1, 1950, a taxable territory.For the assessment year 1950-51, income-tax was sought to beimposed in the State of Rajasthan.  One			    455Madan Gopal Kabra move the High Court under Art. 226 of	 theConstitution   to  restrain  the  taxing  authorities	fromclaiming  tax  for  the	 period	 prior	to  April  1,  1950,contending  that  inasmuch as Rajasthan was  not  a  taxableterritory before April 1, 1950, no tax for a period prior tothat date could be demanded.  This Court in an appeal by theDepartment  against  the  decision  of	the  High  Court  ofRajasthan, which had accepted the contention, held that	 thetax  was leviable.  It is not necessary to give the  detailsof  the	 decision on that occasion.  The  judgment  of	thisCourt is reported in The Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra(1).The  present appellant and fourteen others  filed  petitionsunder Art. 226 of the Constitution, urging fresh grounds  bya later amendment.  Their contention was that s. 14(2)(c) ofthe  Indian  Income-tax Act, as it stood on April  1,  1950,granted	 an  exemption,	 and that  this	 exemption  was	 notaffected by the amendment of the said provision in 1953 eventhough	the amendment was retrospective from April 1,  1950,unless	the Finance Act, 1950, which applied the  Income-taxAct to this area was also amended.  This contention was	 notaccepted  by  the High Court which  dismissed  the  petitionunder Art. 226, holding inter alia that this point was	alsodecided by this Court against Madan Gopal Kabra.In  this  appeal,  this point alone is	argued,	 and  it  iscontended  that	 the  point  is	 still	open  for  decision.Section 14(2)(c), as it stood before the amendment in 1953,read as follows:" The tax shall not be payable by an assessee--(c) in	respect of any income, profits or gains accruing  orarising	   to him within Part B	 State	unless	such income,profits or gains are received or deemed to be received in orare  brought  into the taxable territories  in	the-previousyear  by  or on behalf of the assessee,- or  are  assessableunder section 12-B or section 42 ".The amendment provided"  In section 14 of the principal Act in clause (c) of	sub-section (2), for the words and letter 1 Part B State'(1)  [1954] S.C.R. 541.456the  words    the  State  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir'  shall  besubstituted  and  shall be deemed to have  been	 substitutedwith effect from the 1st day of April, 1950 ". The result ofthis  amendment was described by this Court in Kabra's	case(1) to be as follows:" It may be mentioned here that the exemption from tax undera. 14(2)(c) of the Indian Act of income accruing within PartB States was abrogated, except as regards the State of Jammuand Kashmir, by the amendment of that provision with  effectfrom the first day of April, 1950."Mr.  N. C. Chatterjee appearing for the	 appellant  contendsthat  the  point cannot be considered to have  been  finallydecided, and that the remark is descriptive only of what theParliament  had purported to do.  He claims that  the  pointcan  and  should  be  reconsider.  ed.	In  support  of	 hiscontention,  be urges that the effect of the passing of	 theIndian Finance Act, 1950, and the application of the  IndianIncome-tax  Act to Rajasthan and other Part B States was  toincorporate  the Indian Income-tax Act by reference  in	 theIndian Finance Act with such modifications and amendments aswere  then  made.  Any subsequent amendment  of	 the  IndianIncome-tax  Act	 had  no  effect  on  the  original  Act  asincorporated by reference in the Indian Finance Act,  unlessthe  latter was suitably amended also.	The  argument  whichdid not find favour in Kabra's case (1) was again  advanced,though	in another form.  It is that the amendment  operatesfrom  April  1, 1950, and that the income accrued  prior  toApril  1,  1950,  and  it  was	still  exempt,	because	 theexemption was withdrawn only from April 1, 1950.In  our opinion, both the arguments have no  substance,	 andthe  position indicated by this Court in the  passage  citedearlier,  represents  the true state of the law.   To  beginwith, the exemption is in respect of liability to tax in anyyear of assessment, and the exemption in the assessment year1950-51	 was in regard to the income in the  previous  year.For the same reason, the withdrawal of the exemption in	 theassessment year 1950-51 conversely affected the(1)  [1954] S.C.R. 541.			    457income	of the previous year, 1949-50 which is the  subject-matter of tax in this case.  The next argument	misconceivesthe  nature of the Indian Finance Act, 1950.  By  that	Act,the  Indian Income-tax Act was applied, but  the  Income-taxAct was not incorporated by reference in the Indian  FinanceAct  to become a part of it.  The application of the  IndianIncome-tax Act made Rajasthan a taxable territory subject tothe  Indian Income-tax law, and Parliament was competent  toenact  a new law for the area, just as it did for the  wholeof the rest of India.  The fiction in the amendment made theexemption to disappear as if it had never been granted,	 andunless	there  was a saving, the amendment must	 operate  toobliterate  the	 exemption. in fact, the whole	purpose	 andintent	of the amendment was to reach this result  from	 theassessment  year  1950-51  onwards, and there  could  be  nosaving.	  The argument assumes the premise that the  Income-tax  Act was incorporated in the Indian Finance	 Act,  1950,but   there  is	 neither  precedent  nor  warrant  for	 theassumption  that  when one Act applies another Act  to	someterritory,  the latter Act must be taken to be	incorporatedin the former Act.  It may be otherwise, if there were wordsto  show  that	the earlier Act is to be deemed	 to  be	 re-enacted	 by the new Act.  The Indian Finance Act, 1950,	 wasconcerned with the application of the Indian Income-tax	 Actto  this  area, which it did by amending the  definition  of'taxable  territory'  in the Indian Income-tax	Act  and  byapplying that Act to the territory.  Thereafter, the  IndianParliament  could amend the Income-tax Act  retrospectively,and  the  amendment  would apply also  to  the	new  taxableterritory.   In	 our  opinion, both the	 arguments  are	 notvalid.The appeal fails, and will be dismissed with costs.		     Appeal dismissed.458
