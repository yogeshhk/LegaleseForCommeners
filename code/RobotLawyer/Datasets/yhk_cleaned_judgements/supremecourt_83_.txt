(C)  of S. 12(5)  ofthat Act, which provided that in the case of assets acquiredbefore the previous year and before the commencement of	 theAct, the written down value would be the actual cost to	 theassessee  less (1) depreciation at the rates  applicable  tothe assets calculated on the actual costs for the first yearsince  acquisition and for the next year on the actual	costdiminished by the depreciation allowance for one year and soon,  for each year upto the commencement of that  Act,	and,(ii)  depreciation actually allowed to the assessee on	suchassets for each financial year after the commencement of theAct.  After the merger of Hyderabad with the Union of India,by  ss. 3 and 13 of the Finance Act, 950, the taxation	lawsin  force in the State were repealed and the Indian  Income-tax Act, 1922, was extended to that area; and in exercise ofthe powers conferred by S. 12 of the Finance Act, 1950,	 theCentral	 Government issued a notification dated December  2,1950,  called the Taxation Laws (Part B States) (Removal  ofDifficulties)  Order,  1950.   Paragraph  2  of	 the   Orderprovided  that " in making any assessment under	 the  Indian Income-tax	 Act,  1922, all depreciation  actually  allowedunder  any  laws or rules of a Part B State......  shall  betaken  into account in computing the aggregate	depreciationallowance referred to in proviso (c) to s. 10(2)(vi) and thewritten down value under s. 10(5)(b) of the said Act ".For the assessment year 1951-52 the respondent was  assessedfor  the  first time under the Indian  Income-tax  Act,	 andbasing its claim on para. 2 of the aforesaid Order it  askedfor319the value thereof at their inception and deducting therefromsuch  depreciation as was allowed for the  three  assessmentyears  in which it was assessed under the Hyderabad  Income-tax Act. 7 By order dated November 30, 1951, the  Income-taxOfficer disallowed the respondent's claim on the ground thatit   was   against  the	 principle  inherent   in   grantingdepreciation  allowance	 which must decrease  from  year  toyear.	The  matter was taken up to the	 Supreme  Court	 andwhile  it  was pending there, on May 8,	 1956,	the  CentralGovernment  issued a notification in exercise of its  powersconferred  on it by s. 12 of the Finance Act, 1950,  wherebyan  explanation	 was  added  to the  aforesaid	para.  2  asfollows: "For the purpose of this paragraph, the  expression"all  depreciation actually allowed under any laws or  rulesof a Part B State " means and shall be deemed to have alwaysmeant  the aggregate allowance for depreciation	 taken	intoaccount	 in computing the written down value under any	lawsor rules of a Part B State or carried forward under the saidlaws  or rules." The respondent challenged the	validity  ofthe  notification of 1956 and also its applicability to	 thepresent case on the grounds (1) that it was ultra vires	 thepowers	conferred on the Central Government by s. 12 of	 theFinance	 Act, 1950, (2) that it contravened Art. 14  of	 theConstitution,  and (3) that, in any case, it could  have  noretrospective effect.Held : (1) that the true scope and effect of s. 12 was	thatit  was	 for  the Central Government  to  determine  if	 anydifficulty of the nature indicated in the section had arisenand  then  to make such order, or give	such  direction,  asappeared to it to be necessary to remove the difficulty, thelegislature having left the matter to the executive.Pandit Banarsi Das Bhanot v The State of Madhya Pradesh	 andOthers, [1959] S.C.R. 427, relied on.In  the	 present case, a difficulty had arisen,	 because  ifdepreciation actually allowed under the Hyderabad Income-taxAct was taken into account in computing the aggregate depre-ciation	 allowance and the written down value, an  anomalousresult	would follow, namely, depreciation allowance  to  beallowed	 to  the assessee in the accounting year  under	 theIndian Income-tax Act would be more than what was allowed inprevious   years   under  the  Hyderabad   Income-tax	Act.Consequently,  the Central Government was within  its  powerunder s. 12 in making the notification dated May 8, 1956.(2)  that  the notification of 1956 applied to all those  towhom  para. 2 of the Taxation Laws (Part B States)  (Removalof Difficulties) Order, 1950, was applicable and created  nounequal	  treatment  of	 persons  in  the  like	  situation.Accordingly, the notification did not contravene Art. 14  ofthe Constitution.(3)  that  the Central Government had the power under S.  12of  the	 Finance  Act,	1950, to make an  order	 or  give  adirection  so as to remove difficulties which arose  in	 thevery beginning320and, therefore, the notification, though added in 1956,	 wasvalid and was applicable to the assessment of 1951-52.JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 5 of 1959.Appeal from the judgment and order dated February 16,  1954,of  the former Hyderabad High Court in Reference No.  347/B-5/2 of 1953-54.C.

The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbyS.   K. DAS J.-This is an appeal on a certificate of fitnessgranted	 by the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad  unders.66-A	(2)  of	 the  Indian  Income-tax  Act,	1922.	 TheCommissioner  of  Income-tax, Hyderabad,  is  the  appellantbefore	us.  The respondent is Dewan Bahadur Ramgopal  MillsLtd., a public limited company incorporated in the erstwhileState of Hyderabad.The  respondent	 company was assessed  under  the  HyderabadIncome-tax  Act in respect of the assessment  years  1357-F,1358-F	and  1359-F.   In the  assessment  for	those  yearsdepreciation  allowance was given to it on the basis of	 thewritten	 down  value  of  its  assets,	such  as  buildings,machinery, plant, etc., in accordance with the provisions ofcl.  (c) of s. 12(5) of the Hyderabad Income-tax Act.	Thatclause	provided that in the case of assets acquired  beforethe  previous year and before the commencement of  the	Act,the  written  down  value would be the actual  cost  to	 theassessee  less (i) depreciation at the rates  applicable  tothe assets calculated on the actual cost for the first	yearsince  acquisition and for the next year on the actual	costdiminished by the depreciation allowance for one year and soon, for each year upto the commencement of the Act, and (ii)depreciation actually allowed to the assessee on such assetsfor each financial year after the commencement of the321Act.   The erstwhile State of Hyderabad merged in the  Unionof  India  on January 26, 1950, and became a Part  B  State.The  Finance  Act,  1950,  by s.  13  thereof  repealed	 thetaxation  laws in force in Part B States except for  certainpurposes not relevant to this case, and by s. 3 extended theIndian	Income-tax Act, 1922, to the whole of  India  exceptthe  State of Jammu and Kashmir.  In exercise of the  powersconferred  by  s. 12 of the Finance Act, 1950,	the  CentralGovernment  was	 pleased to make the Taxation Laws  (Part  BStates)	 (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 1950	(hereinafterreferred to as the Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950),  bya  notification dated December 2, 1950.	 Paragraph 2 of	 thesaid Order, in so far as it is relevant to this case, was inthese terms:"  Computation	of  aggregate  depreciation  allowance	 andwritten down value:In  making any assessment under the Indian  Income-tax	Act,1922,  all depreciation actually allowed under any  laws  orrules  of a Part B State, relating to Income-tax and  Super-tax,  or  any law relating to tax on  profits  of  business,shall  be  taken  into account in  computing  the  aggregatedepreciation allowance referred to in sub-clause (c) of	 theproviso	 to clause (vi) of sub-section (2) and	the  writtendown value under clause (b) of sub-section (5) of sec. 10 ofthe said Act".For the assessment year 1951-52 which was in respect of	 theaccount	 year  ending  June 30,	 1950,	the  respondent	 wasassessed for the first time under the Indian Income-tax Act,1922,  read with paragraph 5 of the Part B States  (TaxationConcessions)  Order, 1950.  Basing its claim on paragraph  2of  the Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950, the  respondentasked  for depreciation allowance in respect of	 its  assetssuch  as buildings, machinery, plant, etc., to the  tune  ofRs.8,12,244. It worked out the value of the assets at  theirinception  and deducted therefrom such depreciation  as	 wasallowed	 for  the  three  assessment  years  in	 which	 therespondent  was assessed under the Hyderabad Income-tax	 Actand calculating the written down322value  in that manner, it claimed depreciation according  tothe prescribed rates.  By his order dated November 30, 1951,the Income-tax Officer disallowed this claim.  He held	thatthe  claim  of	the respondent	was  against  the  principleinherent  in  granting	depreciation  allowance	 which	mustdecrease from year to year, and further held that the word "allowed	 "  in paragraph 2 of the  Removal  of	DifficultiesOrder,	1950, should be construed as meaning " considered  "only.  Accordingly, he took the figures of the written	downvalue from the income-tax proceedings of 1359-F and  alloweddepreciation  at  the  prescribed  rate	 on  those  figures.Against the order of the Income-tax Officer, the  respondentwent  in  appeal to the	 Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner,Hyderabad Division.  That Officer by an order dated May	 23,1952,  upheld  the  view  of  the  Income-tax  Officer	 anddismissed  the	appeal.	  Then there was an  appeal  to	 theIncome-tax Appellate Tribunal which was heard by the  BombayBench of the said Tribunal.  By its order dated December 12,1952,  the Appellate Tribunal held that in view of the	pro-visions in paragraph 2 of the Removal of Difficulties Order,1950, the contention of the respondent must prevail, and  itpointed	 out  that  the words used in  paragraph  2  were  "depreciation  actually allowed under any laws or rules of  aPart  B State ", and those words did not mean the  aggregateallowance  for depreciation taken into account in  computingthe  written down value under the Hyderabad Act;  therefore,the  respondent was entitled to the  depreciation  allowancewhich  it  claimed.  It directed the Income-tax	 Officer  tocompute	 the written down value on the basis of	 the  actualcost  to  the assessee of the assets in question  minus	 thedepreciation  allowance	 actually allowed  to  the  assesseeunder  the Hyderabad Income-tax Act.  The  appellant  hereinthen  moved  the Appellate Tribunal for a reference  to	 theHigh Court under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act.	  Inthe  meantime,	that  is,  on March  9,	 1953,	the  CentralGovernment purporting to exercise its powers conferred by s.60-A   of  the	Indian	Income-tax  Act,  1922,	  added	  anExplanation			    323to  paragraph 2 of the Removal of Difficulties Order,  1950.Explanation said:"  Explanation	:--For the purpose of  this  paragraph,	 theexpression  "  all depreciation actually allowed  under	 anylaws or rules of a Part B State " means and shall be  deemedto   have   always  meant  the	 aggregate   allowance	 fordepreciation  taken  into account in computing	the  writtendown  value  under any laws or rules of a Part	B  State  orcarried forward under the said laws or rules ".The Explanation in terms gave effect to the contention urgedon  behalf  of the Department and said that what has  to  beallowed	 is the aggregate allowance for	 depreciation  takeninto  account in computing the written down value under	 anylaw  or	 rules	of  a  Part B  State.	In  support  of	 theapplication  for  a reference, the appellant relied  on	 theaforesaid  Explanation	and contended that in  view  of	 theExplanation  the  respondent could  not	 claim	depreciationallowance on the basis of actual cost minus the depreciationallowances  actually allowed under the Hyderabad  Income-taxAct.   On this application the Tribunal expressed  the	viewthat  if the Explanation applied to the case on	 hand,	thenthe  contention	 of the Department was correct and  must  beupheld.	  It said, however, that it had no power  to  reviewits  own order and, therefore, considered it unnecessary  toexpress	 any opinion whether the Explanation was  valid	 andaffected  the  case  before it.	 It said  finally  that	 thefollowing  question  of law did arise out of its  order	 andaccordingly stated a case thereon:"  Whether  in making the assessment for  the  year  1951-52under  the  Indian Income-tax Act is  the  assessee  companyentitled to claim depreciation allowance on the basis of thewritten	 down value computed at the time of  the  assessmentfor  the year 1359-F, or is to be computed on the  basis  ofthe  actual cost minus the depreciation	 allowances  grantedunder the Hyderabad Income-tax Act".The reference was then heard by the High Court of Judicatureat  Hyderabad  which by its order dated February  16,  1954,held that the Explanation added324to  paragraph 2 of the Removal of Difficulties Order,  1950,by the notification dated March 9, 1953, was void on certaingrounds	 one  of which was that the  Explanation  was  ultravires the powers of the Central Government under s. 60-A  ofthe  Indian  Income-tax	 Act.  Therefore,  it  answered	 thequestion  in favour of the respondent.	The  appellant	thenobtained the necessary certificate of fitness and  preferredthe present appeal.In the meantime, there was a further change of law.  On	 May8, 1956, the Central Government made a notification (No.  S.R. O. 1139) in exercise of the powers conferred on it by  s.12  of	the  Finance Act, 1950, whereby	 an  Explanation  inidentical terms as the earlier Explanation made under s. 60-A of the Indian Income-tax Act, was added to paragraph 2  ofthe  Removal  of Difficulties Order,  1950.   The  argumentsbefore	us  have proceeded on the basis of  the	 Explanationadded  by the notification aforesaid and it is not  disputedthat if the Explanation is valid and applies to the  presentcase,  then the appeal must be allowed and the	question  oflaw  answered  in  favour  of the  appellant.	If,  on	 thecontrary, the Explanation is not valid or it does not  applyto the present case, then the appeal must be dismissed.We proceed now to a consideration in detail of the differentcontentions  urged before us on behalf of the appellant	 andthe respondent.	 We may first read s. 12 of the Finance Act,1950,  under which notification No. S. R. O. 1139 dated	 May8, 1956, was made.  Section 12 reads:"  If  any  difficulty	arises	in  giving  effect  to	 theprovisions  of any of the Acts, rules or orders extended  bysection	 3 or section 11 to any State or  merged  territory,the Central Government may by order, make such provision, orgive  such direction, as appears to it to be  necessary	 forremoving the difficulty ".On  behalf  of	the appellant it has been  argued  that	 thenotification  was  validly made in exercise  of	 the  powersconferred  on the Central Government under s. 12  aforesaid;that it does not suffer from any of the defects pointed	 outby the High Court in regard325to  the earlier notification of 1953 made under s.  60-A  ofthe Income-tax Act; and that it adds an Explanation which interms  gives effect to the contention of the  appellant	 andthis Court must consider the change in law made thereby	 andgive  effect to it in answering the question of law  arisingout  of	 the  Tribunal's  order.  On  the  other  hand,	 thevalidity  of  the  notification has  been  very	 strenuouslycontested  before us by learned Counsel for the	 respondent.He has challenged its validity and also its applicability tothe  present case on the following grounds : (1) that it  isultra  vires the powers conferred on the Central  Governmentby s. 12; (2) that it can have no retrospective effect;	 and(3) that it contravenes Art. 14 of the Constitution.We  shall consider these arguments in the order in which  wehave  stated  them.   The  first  question  is	whether	 thenotification  is  validly made under s. 12 or  is  it  ultravires the powers conferred on the Central Government by thatsection	 ?  On behalf of the respondent it is urged  that  acondition  for	the  exercise of the power under  s.  12  iscontained  in  the  opening clause, which says :  "  If	 anydifficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of	 anyof  the	 Acts,	rules or orders extended  by  section  3  orsection	 II  to any State etc." The contention	is  that  nodifficulty  arose in giving effect to the provisions of	 anyof  the	 Acts, rules or orders referred to  in	the  openingclause, to any State etc. and, therefore, the condition	 forthe  exercise  of  the power is not fulfilled  and  on	thatground the notification is invalid.  We are unable to acceptthis argument as correct.  Section 10 of the Income-tax	 Actsays, in its first subsection, that the tax shall be payableby  an	assessee in respect of the profits or gains  of	 anybusiness, profession or vocation carried on by him.   Sub-s.(2)  thereof  says  that  such profits	or  gains  shall  becomputed  after making certain allowances, and one of  theseallowances  is	in  respect  of	 the  depreciation  of	suchbuildings,  machinery,	plant,	etc. as	 are  used  for	 thepurpose	 of the business (cl. vi).  The depreciation  exceptin  certain cases is calculated on the written	down  value,which expression is explained326in  sub-s.  (5)	 of s. 10.  Clause (b)	of  the	 sub-sectionstates:"S.10(5)--(a)................................................(b) In the case of assets acquired before the previous	yearthe  actual  cost  to the  assessee  less  all	depreciationactually allowed to him under this Act, or any Act  repealedthereby	 or  under executive orders issued when	 the  IndianIncome-tax Act, 1886 (11 of 1886), was in force ".It  is obvious that in applying cl. (b) to an assessee in  aPart  B	 State there would be an initial difficulty,  in  asmuch  as prior to 1950 when the Indian Income-tax  Act	cameinto force in a Part B State no depreciation could have beenactually  allowed to such an assessee under  the  Income-taxAct  or	 under any Act repealed thereby;  for  example,	 theHyderabad  Income-tax Act was repealed by the  Finance	Act,1950 and not by the Income-tax Act, and would not  thereforebe  covered by cl. (b).	 Such and other difficulties led  tothe Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950, which has not	beenseriously challenged before us.	 Indeed, the High Court saidthat  it  was not open to the respondent  to  challenge	 thevalidity of the Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950, becausesuch  a	 point was not taken before the	 Tribunal.   LearnedCounsel	 for  the respondent has then submitted	 that  what.ever  initial  difficulty there might have  been  in  givingeffect	to the Indian Income-tax Act in a Part	State,	thatdifficulty  was	 solved	 by paragraph 2 of  the	 Removal  ofDifficulties  Order,  1950, and, in any view, there  was  nofresh difficulty which could necessitate the addition of  anExplanation  in 1953 or 1956.  Here again we think that	 thesubmission  is not correct.  The basic and normal scheme  ofdepreciation  under  the Indian Income-tax Act	is  that  itdecreases every year, being a percentage of the written downvalue which in the first year is the actual cost and in suc-ceeding	 years	actual cost less all  depreciation  actuallyallowed under the Income-tax Act or an Act repealed  therebyetc.  The Hyderabad Income-tax Act not having been repealedby  the Income-tax Act but by the Finance Act,	1950,  therewas a difficulty in			    327allowing  depreciation to an assessee in a Part B  State  inthe  first  year of assessment under the  Indian  Income-taxAct.  This difficulty was sought to be removed by  paragraph2 of the Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950.  If,  however,depreciation actually allowed under the Hyderabad Income-taxAct  was  taken	 into account  in  computing  the  aggregatedepreciation  allowance	 and  the  written  down  value,  ananomalous  result  would  follow as  in	 the  present  case,namely, depreciation allowance to be allowed to the assesseein the accounting year under the Indian Income-tax Act wouldbe  more than what was allowed in previous years  under	 theHyderabad Income-tax Act.  This would create a disparity andbe against the scheme of the Indian Income-tax Act.  It	 wastherefore necessary to explain paragraph 2 of the Removal ofDifficulties  Order,  1950, to assimilate or  harmonise	 theposition   regarding   depreciation   allowance,   and	 theExplanation added in 1953 or 1956 was obviously intended  toremove	the  difficulty	 arising out of	 that  disparity  ordisharmony.Furthermore, the true scope and effect of s. 12 seems to  bethat  it is for the Central Government to determine  if	 anydifficulty of the nature indicated in the section has arisenand  then  to make such order, or give	such  direction,  asappears	 to  it to be necessary to  remove  the	 difficulty.Parliament  has left the matter to the executive;  but	thatdoes  not  make	 the notification of 1956  bad.	  In  PanditBanarsi Das Bhanot v. The State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. (1)we  said at page 435: " Now, the authorities are clear	thatit  is not unconstitutional for the legislature to leave  itto  the	 executive  to determine  details  relating  to	 theworking of taxation laws, such as the selection of  personson  whom the tax is to be laid, the rates at which it is  tobe charged in respect of different classes of goods and	 thelike ". We are, therefore, of the view that the notificationof 1956, was validly made under s. 12 and is not ultra viresthe  powers  conferred	on the Central	Government  by	thatsection.The second question is-does the notification apply(1)  [1959] S.C.R. 427.328to  the	 assessment  in	 the  present  case,  which  is	  anassessment for the year 1951-52 ? The notification was	madein  1956 and it added an Explanation to paragraph 2  of	 theRemoval	 of  Difficulties  Order,  1950.   It  says  that  aparticular expression occurring in that paragraph means	 andshall be deemed always to have meant the aggregate allowancefor depreciation taken into account in computing the writtendown  value  etc.,  under any law of a Part  B	State.	 Theargument  on behalf of the respondent is that the law  whichgoverns an assessment for the assessment year 1951-52 is thelaw  in force at the time when the Finance Act,	 1951,	cameinto force; accordingly, so the argument proceeds, paragraph2 of the Removal of Difficulties Order, 1950, as it stood onApril 28, 1951, when the Finance Act, 1951, came into force,will  apply in the present case.  We consider this  argumentto  be	unsound.   The Explanation, though  added  in  1956,explains  the  meaning	of paragraph 2	of  the	 Removal  ofDifficulties Order, 1950 and says in express terms that	 theparagraph  shall be deemed always to have had that  meaning.Section	 12  by the very nature of its	intent	and  purposeconfers on the Central Government power to make an order  toremove a difficulty which has already arisen, and the  powerto  re.	 move the difficulty must  necessarily	include	 thepower to remove the difficulty from the time it arose.	 TheCentral	 Government  has, therefore, the power	to  make  anorder  or  give a direction so as to remove  the  difficultyfrom  the very beginning, and that is what the	notificationof  1956  does.	  It applies to the  assessment	 of  1951-52indeed	it applies to all assessments made under the  IndianIncome-tax  Act	 in  which paragraph 2	of  the	 Removal  ofDifficulties Order, 1950, operates.The  last challenge to the validity of the  notification  of1956  is  that it contravenes Art. 14 of  the  Constitution,because	 it discriminates between different classes  of	 taxpayers.	 Learned Counsel for the respondent has asked us  toconsider  the  cases of assessees in three  different  areaswhich subsequently come in a Part B State:   in	  one	areathere was no law relating to329income-tax;  in,  the  second there was a  law	relating  toincome-tax  under which written down value was	computed  onthe basis of depreciation actually allowed year after  year,while  in the third the written down value was	computed  inthe  manner provided under the Hyderabad Income-tax Act;  itis  pointed out that on the extension of the Indian  Income-tax   Act  (read  with	paragraph  2  of  the	Removal	  ofDifficulties  Order,  1950  and the  Explanation)  to  thoseareas, the assessee in the first area will get	depreciationallowance on the actual cost; in the second area he will getsuch allowance on the basis of actual cost less depreciationactually  allowed;  and in the third area he will  get	suchallowance  on the actual cost less depreciation	 taken	intoaccount.  It is contended that this resultant discriminationis  arbitrary  and without any	rational  justification,  Wethink  that learned Counsel for the respondent	has  ignoredone  essential	consideration  which  clearly  vitiates	 hisargument.   In	the matter of  depreciation  allowance,	 theassessee  in the three areas in the example given by him  donot  stand on the same footing; they are not situated  alikeso  as	to be entitled to be treated alike.  It	 is  obviousthat an assessee from an area where there was no  income-taxlaw at all can never say that in the matter of	depreciationallowance  as respects buildings, machinery, plant etc.,  heis  on a par with a person in an area where there was a	 lawrelating   to  income-tax  allowing  depreciation  on	suchbuildings,  machinery,	plant etc.  The same  would  be	 theposition  with regard to areas where the previous law as  todepreciation  was  different.  Indeed, to  treat  all  thesepersons alike would be tantamount to unequal treatment.	  Inour  view,  the	 notification of  1956	creates	 no  unequaltreatment of persons in a like situation ; it applies to allwho  are  in  a like situation, namely, all  those  to	whomparagraph  2  of the Removal of	 Difficulties  Order,  1950,applies.  We consider that the challenge to the notificationbased on Art. 14 is wholly unsubstantial.It has not been disputed before us that a change in42330law validly made and applicable to a case pending in  appealmust  be  considered and given effect to  by  the  AppellateCourt.	  The  conclusion  we  have  reached  is  that	 thenotification  of  1956 was validly made and applies  to	 thepresent case.  In view of this conclusion we have consideredit  unnecessary to examine the notification of 1953  or	 thereasons	 for which the High Court held that notification  tobe bad.For  the reasons given above, we allow this appeal  and	 setaside  the  judgment  and  order of  the  High	Court  datedFebruary 16, 1954.  The question referred to the High  Courtis  answered in favour of the appellant.  The appellant	 hassucceeded  by reason of the notification of 1956 and  takingthat  circumstance into consideration, we direct that  therewill be no order for costs for the hearing in this Court.Appeal allowed.
