IO.HEADNOTE:The  second respondent sold the properties to the  appellantin  ,952  and the deed of sale recited that  the  propertieswere  sold free of all encumbrances.  The  first  respondentwho  had  obtained  a  mortgage decree	in  respect  of	 theproperties in 1935 did not take any steps to have the decreedrawn  up as required under the Original Side Rules  of	 theCalcutta   High	 Court	until  1954,  when   she   commencedproceedings  for  sale	of the	mortgaged  properties.	 Thesecond respondent raised the objection that the execution ofthe  decree was barred by limitation but that was  overruledby  a single judge of the High Court and an  appeal  againstthat   order  was  preferred  by  the	second	 respondent.Apprehending  that the second respondent might enter into  acollusive arrangement with the first respondent with a	viewto  defeat her rights, the appellant made an application  inthe  High  Court  under 0. 22, r. 10 of the  Code  of  CivilProcedure praying that she might be substituted in the placeof the second respondent, or in the alternative, be  broughton  record as additional appellant.  The High  Court  havingdismissed the application, the appellant brought the presentappeal:Held,  that the application could not be sustained under  0.22,  r.10,  of	the  Code of  Civil  Procedure	because	 (i)assuming that1288the  suit  was considered as having been pending  until	 thedecree	was drawn up in 954 no application was made  to	 theCourt  where the suit was pending as provided in 0.  22,  r.10, and (ii) the application made to the appellate Court wasalso  not within 0. 22, r. 10, as the transfer	in  questionwas  made prior to the filing of the appeal and	 not  duringits pendency.The application, however, falls within s. I46 of the Code ofCivil Procedure and the appellant is entitled to be  broughton record since an appeal is a proceeding within the meaningof that section and the right to file an appeal carries withit  the right to continue an appeal which had been filed  bythe person under whom the appellant claims.Jugalkishore Sayaf v.

C. Chatterjee and P. K. Mukherjee, for the appellant.B. Sen and P. K. Ghosh (for P. K. Bose), for respondent	 No.1.1958.  February 14.  The Judgment of the Court was deliveredbyVENICATARAMA AIYAR J.-This is an appeal against an order  ofthe  High Court of Calcutta dated August 6, 1956,  rejectingthe application of the appellant to be brought on record  asappellant in appeal No. 152 of 1955 pending before it.The second respondent, Sudhir Kumar Mitter, was the owner oftwo  houses, No. 86/1, Cornwallis Street and No. 7-C,  KirtiMitter	Lane,  Calcutta.   On May 19, 1934,  he	 executed  amortgage for Rs. 3,000 over the said houses in favour of thefirst respondent, Sm. Nirmala Sundari Dassi.  She institutedSuit  No. 158 of 1935 on this mortgage, and obtained a	pre-liminary  decree  on March 8, 1935.  The  matter  then	camebefore	the  Registrar for taking of accounts,	and  by	 hisreport dated July 23, 1935 he found that a sum1289of Rs. 3,914-6-6 was due to her, and on that, a final decreewas passed on April 20, 1936.  Under r. 27 of ch. 16 of	 theOriginal Side Rules of the Calcutta High Court, a person  inwhose favour a decree is passed has to apply for drawing  upof  the decree within four days from the date thereof.	 Therule then provides that " if such application for drawing upa decree or order is not made within the time aforesaid, thedecree or order,shall not be drawn up except under order  ofCourt  or a Judge to be obtained, unless otherwise  ordered,by  a petition ex parte ". The importance of this  provisionis that until a decree is drawn up as mentioned therein,  nocertified  copy	 thereof would be issued to  the  party	 andwithout	 such  a certified copy,  no  execution	 proceedingscould be taken.The  first respondent who had acted with such  alacrity	 andspeed  in  putting  her mortgage in  suit  and	obtaining  adecree,	 took no steps whatsoever to have the  decree  drawnup,  for  nearly  18 years.  On May  12,  1952,	 the  secondrespondent sold both the houses to the appellant herein	 fora  sum	of  Rs. 60,000 which was,  it  is  stated,  utilisedlargely for discharging prior mortgages on which decrees hadbeen obtained and execution proceedings taken.	The deed  ofsale  recites  that  the properties were sold  free  of	 allencumbrances.  The first respondent who had so far taken  nosteps to have the decree drawn up now bestirred herself, andon February 17, 1954 obtained an ex parte order under r.  27aforesaid,  granting her leave to draw up and  complete	 thedecree.	  That having been done pursuant to the	 order,	 shefiled  on  April 29, 1954 the final  decree,  and  commencedproceedings for sale of the mortgaged properties.Coming	to  know  of this, the	second	respondent  appearedbefore	the  Registrar, and raised the	objection  that	 theexecution  of  the  decree was barred  by  limitation.	 TheRegistrar felt some doubt in the matter, and made a  specialreport under ch. 26, r. 50 seeking the opinion of the  Courton the question of limitation, and the first respondent	 wasalso directed to take out a notice of motion for directions.The  matter  then came before P. B. Mukharji  J.  and  afterhearing1290counsel for both the respondents, he held that the executionof  the	 decree was not barred.	 Vide judgment	reported  inNirmala Sundari v. Sudhir Kumar (1).  Against this judgment,the second respondent preferred Appeal No. 152 of 1955,	 andthat is still pending.We  now	 come to the application, out of which	the  presentappeal arises.	On July 25, 1956 the appellant applied to bebrought	 on record as appellant in Appeal No. 152  of  1955.The allegations in support of the petition were that she hadpurchased  the properties from the second respondent on	 May12,  1952  free	 of all	 encumbrances,	that  the  executionproceedings  started  by  the  first  respondent  were	 notmaintainable as the decree had become time-barred, that	 thesecond respondent, Sudhir Kumar Mitter, had been  conductingproceedings in opposition to the execution sale only at	 herinstance  and for her benefit, that he had filed Appeal	 No.152  of	 1955  also oil her behalf,  that  latterly  he	 hadentered	  into	a  collusive  arrangement  with	 the   firstrespondent  with  a  view to defeat  her  rights,  and	thattherefore  it  was necessary that she should be	 allowed  tocome  on record as appellant so that she might	protect	 herinterests.   The  prayer  in the petition was  that  she  besubstituted in the place of the second respondent or in	 thealternative, be brought on record as additional appellant.The   application  was	strenuously  opposed  by  both	 therespondents.   They  stated that they had  entered  into  anarrangement settling the amount due to the first  respondentat  Rs. 17,670, that that settlement was fair and bona	fideand   binding  on  the	appellant,  and	 that  further	 herapplication  was  not maintainable.   This  application	 washeard by Chakravarti C. J. and Lahiri J. and by their  orderdated August 6, 1956, they dismissed it.  The appellant thenapplied	 under Art. 133 for leave to appeal to	this  Court,and in rejecting that application, the learned Chief Justiceobserved  that	the original application  was  pressed	onlyunder  0. 22, r. 10 of the Civil Procedure Code and  it	 wasdismissed, as it was conceded that the applicant,(1)  A.I.R. 1955 Cal. 484.1291not  being  a  person who had obtained	a  transfer  pendingappeal, was not entitled to apply on the terms of that rule,that the prayer in the alternative that the applicant  mightbe brought on record without being substituted under 0.	 22,r.  10 which merited favourable consideration bad  not	beenmentioned  at the previous hearing, and that no	 certificatecould  be granted under Art. 133 with a view to	 that  pointbeing  raised in appeal, as the order sought to be  appealedagainst	 was  not a final order.  The  appellant  thereafterobtained  special  leave  to appeal under Art.	136  of	 theConstitution, and that is how the appeal comes before us.It  is	contended  OD  behalf  of  the	appellant  that	 herapplication is maintainable under 0. 22, r. 10 of the  CivilProcedure  Code,  because  Suit	 No. 158  of  1935  must  beconsidered to have been pending until the decree therein wasdrawn  up which was in 1954, and the transfer in her  favourhad  been made prior thereto on May 12, 1952.  The  decisionin  Lakshan  Chunder Dey v. Sm.	 Nikunjamani  Dassi  (1)  isrelied on, in support of this position.	 But it is contendedfor  the first respondent that even if Suit No. 158 of	1935is considered as pending when the transfer in favour of	 theappellant  was made, that would not affect the result as  noapplication had been made by her to be brought on record  inthe  original  court during the pendency of the	 suit.	 Norcould  the  application	 made  to  the	appellate  Court  besustained  under 0. 22, r. 10, as the transfer in favour  ofthe  appellant was made prior to the filing of	that  appealand not during its pendency.  This contention appears to  bewell-founded  ;	 but that, however, does  not  conclude	 thematter.	  In  our  opinion, the	 application  filed  by	 theappellant  falls within s. 146 of the Civil Procedure  Code,and  she  is  entitled to be brought on	 record	 under	thatsection.   Section  146	 provides  that	 save  as  otherwiseprovided by the Code, any proceeding which can be taken by aperson	may also be taken by any person claiming under	him.It has been held in Sitharamaswami v. Lakshmi Narasimha	 (2)that an appeal is a proceeding for the(1) (1923) 27 C.W.N. 755.164(2) (1918) I.L.R. 41 Mad. 510.1292purpose	 of this section, and that further the expression  "claiming   under"  is  wide  enough  to	 include  cases	  ofdevolution  and assignment mentioned in 0. 22, r. 10.	Thisdecision   was	quoted	with  approval	by  this  Court	  inJugalkishore  Saraf v. Raw Cotton Co., Ltd. (1), wherein  itwas  hold  that a transferee of a debt on which a  suit	 waspending	 was  entitled	to  execute  the  decree  which	 wassubsequently  passed  therein,	under s. 146  of  the  CivilProcedure Code as a person claiming under the decree-holder,even  though an application for execution by him  would	 notlie under 0. 21, r. 16, and it was further observed that thewords "save as otherwise provided " only barred proceedings,which would be obnoxious to some provision of the Code.	  Itwould  follow  from the above authorities  that	 whoever  isentitled to be but has not been brought oil record under  0.22, r. 10 in a pending suit or proceeding would be  entitledto  prefer  an	appeal against the decree  or  order  passedtherein	 if  his assignor could have filed such	 an  appeal,there being no prohibition against it in the Code, and	thataccordingly  the  appellant  as an assignee  of	 the  secondrespondent  of	the  mortgaged properties  would  have	beenentitled  to prefer an appeal against the judgment of P.  B.Mukharji J.It  is	next  contended	 that s.  146  authorises  only	 theinitiation of any proceeding, and that though it would	havebeen competent to the appellant to have preferred an  appealagainst	 the  judoment of P. B. Mukharji J. she	 not  havingdone  so  was  not entitled to be brought on  record  as  anappellant  to  continue the appeal preferred by	 the  secondrespondent.  We are not disposed to construe s. 146 narrowlyin  the	 manner	 contended  for by  counsel  for  the  firstrespondent.  That section was introduced for the first	timein  the	 Civil	Procedure  Code, 1908  with  the  object  offacilitating the exercise of rights by persons in whom	theycome  to be vested by devolution or assignment, and being  abeneficent provision should be construed liberally and so asto  advance  justice and not in a  restricted  or  technicalsense.	It has been held by a Full Bench of the Madras	HighCourt in Muthiah Chettiar v. Oovinddoss Krishnadass (2) thatthe assignee of a part of a(1) [1955] i S.C.R. 1369.(2) (1921) I.L.R. 44 Mad. 919.1293decree	is  entitled to continue  an  execution	 applicationfiled  by  the transferor-decree-holder.  Vide	also  MoidinKutty  v. Doraiswami (1).  The right to file an appeal	musttherefore be held to carry with it the right to continue  anappeal	which  had been filed by the person under  whom	 theapplicant  claims, and the petition of the appellant  to  bebrought on record as an appellant in Appeal No. 152 of	1955must be held to be main. tainable under s. 146.It remains to consider whether, on the merits, there  shouldbe an order in favour of the appellant.	 Of that, we have nodoubt  whatsoever.   The proceedings in which she  seeks  tointervene arise in execution of a mortgage decree.  She	 haspurchased  the	properties comprised in the decree  for	 Rs.60,000	 under	 a  covenant  that  they   are	 free	fromencumbrances.  And after her purchase, the first  respondenthas  started proceedings for sale of the properties,  nearly18  years after the decree had been passed.   The  appellantmaintains  that	 the  execution proceedings  are  barred  bylimitation, and desires to be heard on that question.  It istrue  that P. B. Mukharji J. has rejected  this	 contention,but  a	reading of his judgment shows-and that	is  what  hehimself observes-that there are substantial questions of lawcalling	  for  decision.   Even	 apart	from  the  plea	  oflimitation,  there  is	also a question	 as  to	 the  amountpayable in discharge and satisfaction of the decree obtainedby  the first respondent in Suit No. 158 of 1935.  Both	 therespondents  claim that they have settled it at Rs.  17,670.But  it	 is stated for the appellant that under	 the  decreewhich  is sought to be executed the amount  recoverable	 forprincipal  and interest will not exceed Rs. 6,000.   In	 theaffidavit  of  Sanjit Kumar Ghose dated December  20,  1956,filed  on  behalf of the first respondent,  particulars	 aregiven as to how the sum of Rs. 17,670 was made up.  It	willbe  seen  therefrom that a sum of Rs. 7,200 is	claimed	 forinterest up to March 8, 1956, calculating it not at the rateprovided in the final decree but at the contract rate.	Thena sum of Rs. 5,000 is included as for costs incurred by	 themortgagee in suits other than(1)  I.L.R. 1952 Mad. 622.1294Suit No. 158 of 1935 and in proceedings connected therewith.The  appellant	contends that the properties  in  her  handscould,	under  no  circumstances, be made  liable  for	thisamount.	  A sum of Rs. 1,750 is agreed to be paid for  costsin  the	 sale  reference, in the proceedings  before  P.  B.Mukharji  J.  and  in  Appeal No. 152  of  1955.   Asks	 theappellant,  where is the settlement in this, and how can  itbind  me ? It is obvious that there are several	 substantialquestions  arising for determination in which the  appellantas  purchaser of the properties is vitally  interested,	 andindeed	is  the	 only person  interested.   As	a  purchaserpendente lite, she will be bound by the proceedings taken bythe first respondent in execution of her decree, and justicerequires that she should be given an opportunity to  protecther rights.We accordingly set aside the order of the Court below  datedAugust	6, 1956 and direct that the appellant be brought  onrecord	as additional appellant in Appeal No. 152  of  1955.As  Sudhir  Kumar Mitter, the appellant now on	record,	 hasdropped	 the  fight with the first respondent,	we  conceivethat  no embarrassment will result in there being on  recordtwo  appellants	 with  Conflicting interest.   But,  in	 anyevent,	the  Court can, if necessary, take action  suo	motueither under 0. 1, r. 10 or in its inherent jurisdiction andtranspose  Sudhir Kumar Mitter as second respondent  in	 theappeal,	 as was done in In re Mathews. Oates v. Mooney	(1),and  Vanjiappa	Goundan v. Annamalai Chettiar (2 ).  As	 forcosts,	the appellant should, in terms of the order of	thisCourt  granting	 her  leave to appeal,	pay  the  contestingrespondent  her	 costs	in this appeal.	 The  costs  of	 andincidental  to the application in Appeal No. 152 of 1955  inthe High Court will abide the result of that appeal.		      Appeal allowed.(1) (1905) 2 Ch. 460.
