TheIncome-tax Officer served upon him notices under S. 34	readwith S. 22(2) of the Act for assessment of tax in respect ofthose  years.	The notices in question were  issued  withineight years from the end of the years of assessment and werewithin the period prescribed by s. 34(i)(a).  The  appellantcontended  that notices for assessment were governed by	 cl.(i)(b)	of  S.	34 and not by cl. (i)(a),  even	 though	 theappellant had not made a return of his income for the  yearsin question as a general notice under s. 22(1) did not	giverise to a liability to submit a return and his inaction	 didnot  amount to omission or failure to submit a return as  hewas  a	non-resident, and the  assessment  proceedings	werebarred by limitation.Held,  that the expression "every person " in s. 22  (1)  ofthe  Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, includes all	persons	 whoare  liable  to pay tax and non-residents are  not  exemptedfrom  liability to submit a return pursuant to	the  generalnotice thereunder.Once  a	 notice is given by publication	 in  the  prescribedmanner under s. 22(i), every person whether resident or non-resident whose income exceeds the maximum amount exempt fromtax is obliged to submit a return and if he does not do so,36it  will  be deemed that there was omission on his  part  tomake  a	 return	 within the meaning of S.  34(i)(a)  of	 theIndian	Income	tax Act.  Section 34(1)(b) applied  only  tothose cases where there was no omission or failure to make areturn	of the income or to make a full and true  disclosureof facts material to the  assessment.In the instant case the proceedings for assessment were pro-perly  commenced within the period of limitation  prescribedby s. 34(1)(a).JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 408 of 1957.Appeal	by Special Leave from the Judgment and	Order  datedthe 28th September, 1955, of the former Bombay High Court inIncome-tax Reference No. 5 of 1955.Sanat  P. Mehta, S. N.	Andley, J. B. Dadachanji,  RameshwarNath and P. L. Vohra, for the appellant.A.   N.	 Kripal,  R.  H.  Dhebar  and  D.  Gupta,  for	 therespondent.1960.  October 18.  The Judgment of the Court was  deliveredbySHAH  J.-To  the appellant who was a  non-resident  for	 thepurposes of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, had accrued  inthe  assessment years 1943-44, 194445, 1946-47	and  1947-48certain	 dividend  income within the  taxable  territory  ofBritish	 India, but the appellant did not submit returns  ofhis  income for those assessment years.	 In exercise of	 hispowers	under s. 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922,	 theIncome	Tax Officer, Bombay City, served upon the  appellantnotices	 under	s.  34 read with s, 22(2)  of  the  Act	 forassessment of tax in respect of those years.  The notice forthe  year 1943-44 was served on the appellant on  March	 27,1952,  for  the year 1944-45 on February 16, 1953,  for	 theyear  1946-47 on April 4, 1951 and for the year	 1947-48  onApril  2,  1952.   The	Income	Tax  Officer  completed	 theassessments  in	 respect of the years 1943-44, 1944  45	 and1947-48 on May 6, 1953 and for the year 1946-47 on March 19,1952.	The  orders  of assessment  were  confirmed  by	 theAppellate  Assistant  Commissioner  and by  the	 Income	 TaxAppellate Tribunal.  At the instance of37the  appellant, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal drew up  astatement  of the case under s. 66(1) of the Income Tax	 Actand submitted to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay	 thefollowing two questions:(I).	  Whether  the notices issued under s. 22(2) of	 theAct  read  with s. 34 of the Act for  the  assessment  years1943-44, 1944-45, 1946-47 and 1947-48 were served after	 theperiod of limitation prescribed by s.	34 of the Act?(2)  If the answer to Question No. 1 is in the	affirmative,whether	 the  assessments  for the years  in  question	wereinvalid in law?The  High Court answered the first question in the  negativeand observed that on that answer, the second question "	 didnot  arise  ".	With special leave under  Art.	136  of	 theConstitution,  this  appeal is preferred  by  the  appellantagainst the order of the High Court.The  only  question  which falls to be	determined  in	thisappeal	is  whether  the  proceedings  for  assessment	werecommenced  within  the period of limitation  prescribed	 forserving	 notice of assessment under s. 34(1)(a) of the	Act.At  the	 material  time, by s. 34  (1)(a),  the	 Income	 TaxOfficer	 was invested with power amongst others to serve  atany  time  within eight years from the end of  any  year  ofassessment notice of assessment if he had reason to  believethat  income,  profits or gains had  escaped  assessment  byreason of omission or failure on the part of the assessee tomake a return of his income under s. 22 for that year, or todisclose  fully and truly all material facts  necessary	 forhis  assessment	 of  that year.	 In those  cases  where	 theIncome Tax Officer had in consequence of information in	 hispossession  reason to believe that income, profits or  gainshad escaped assessment even though there was no omission  orfailure	 as  mentioned in el. (a), he could  under  cl.	 (b)within	four  years from the end of the year  of  assessmentserve  a  notice  of assessment.   Admittedly,	the  noticesissued	by the Income Tax Officer for the years in  questionwere issued within eight years from the end of the years  ofassessment  and	 if  el.  (1)(a)  of  s.  34  applied,	 theassessment was not barred by the law of limitation.38But the appellant contended that the notices for  assessmentwere, even though he had not made a return of his income forthe years in question, governed not by cl. (1)(a) of s.	 34,but  by	 cl.  (1)(b) of s. 34.	He contended  that  being  aresident  outside  the taxable territory in the years  of  ,assessment,  a	general notice under s. 22(1) did  not	giverise to a liability to submit a return, and his inaction didnot  amount  to	 omission or failure  to  submit  a  return,inviting  the  applicability of s. 34(1)(a).   He  submittedthat omission or failure to make a return can only arise quaa  non-resident, if no return is filed after service  of  anindividual notice under s. 22(2).  In other words, the	pleais  that a notice under s. 22(1) imposes an obligation	uponpersons	 resident within the taxable territory and not	uponnon-residents, and support for this argument is sought to beobtained from s. 1 sub-s. (2) which extended the Income	 TaxAct at the material time to British India.The expression " every person whose total income during	 theprevious  year	exceeded  the maximum amount  which  is	 notchargeable to income-tax " in s. 22(1) includes all  personswho  are  liable  to pay tax and there	is  nothing  in	 thesection	 or in its context which exempts non-residents	fromliability   to	submit	a  return  pursuant  to	  a   noticethereunder.   The fact that a non-resident assessee may	 notcome to know of the general notice issued under s. 22(1)  isnot  a ground for not giving effect to the plain words	usedin  the	 section.   In terms, the clause  read	with  r.  18requires  every person who has taxable income to submit	 hisreturn, and if he fails to do so, under s. 34 of the Act theIncome	Tax Officer may commence proceedings for  assessmentwithin	the  period  prescribed	 by  cl.  (1)(a).    Section34(1)(b)  applies  only	 to those cases where  there  is  noomission  or  failure to make a return of the income  or  tomake  a	 full and true disclosure of facts material  to	 theassessment.  To the appellant though non-resident income badadmittedly accrued in the taxable territory and that  incomeexceeded  the maximum amount not chargeable to	income-tax.,The appellant not having submitted a return in pursuance  ofthe notice issued under s. 221 the Income Tax39Officer	 was competent under s. 34(1)(a) to issue notice  atany  time  within  eight years of the end  of  the  year  ofassessment for assessing him to tax.  Once a notice is givenby  publication	 in the press and in the  prescribed  mannerunder  s. 22(1), every person whose Th. income	exceeds	 themaximum amount exempt from tax is obliged to submit a returnand  if he does not do so, it will be deemed that there	 wasomission  on his part to a make a return within the  meaningof s. 34(1)(a).	 There is no warrant for the submission thats. 22(1) applies to residents only and that an obligation tomake a return on the part of a nonresident can only arise ifa notice under sub-s. (2) is served.  Under sub-s. (2) it isopen  to  the Income Tax Officer to serve a  special  noticeupon  any  person requiring him to furnish a return  in	 theprescribed  form, but that provision does not derogate	fromthe liability arising under sub-s. (1) to submit a return.The  Income  Tax  Act  extends by s.  1(2)  to	the  taxableterritory  and	not beyond; but within that  territory,	 theIncome	Tax Officer has power to tax income  which  accrues,arises	or  is	received, and that is not  disputed  by	 theappellant.   If power to tax be granted, it is difficult  toappreciate  the	 ground on which the plea that	the  generalprovision imposing liability upon persons receiving  taxableincome is subject to an unexpressed limitation that it is toapply  only  to	 residents and not  to	non-residents.	 Thesubmission  that  a person liable to pay  tax  but  residentoutside the taxable territory must be served with a  specialnotice	under s. 22(2) before his inaction in the matter  ofmaking a return may be deemed omission within the meaning ofs.  34(1)  is  without	force.	There  is  no  such  expressprovision  made by the statute and none can be implied	fromthe context.The  High  Court  was therefore right in  holding  that	 theproceedings  for assessment were properly  commenced  withinthe period of limitation prescribed by s. 34(1)(a) from	 theclose  of the year of assessment.  The appeal fails  and  isdismissed with costs.Appeal dismissed.40
